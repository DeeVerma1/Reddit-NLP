Even by the most conservative \"dog age to human age\" calculations, this seems to be around 140 years in human age. This is significantly higher than the oldest human lifespan ever recorded, which led me to wonder if the translation breaks down as dogs get older. \\n\\nIt's already known to be non-linear because temporal age and developmental age aren't linearly transferable across species, but it makes me wonder if dogs actually have higher lifespan variance than humans or if it's just an incomplete model.   \n",
