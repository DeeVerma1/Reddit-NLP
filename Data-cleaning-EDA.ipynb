Even by the most conservative \"dog age to human age\" calculations, this seems to be around 140 years in human age. This is significantly higher than the oldest human lifespan ever recorded, which led me to wonder if the translation breaks down as dogs get older. \\n\\nIt's already known to be non-linear because temporal age and developmental age aren't linearly transferable across species, but it makes me wonder if dogs actually have higher lifespan variance than humans or if it's just an incomplete model.   \n",

We all heard about the damage to the pipelines and the public discussion revolves mainly around the question of possible sabotage. What hasn't been discussed much are the technical questions that come with it. Can they realistically be repaired? How long would it take? If nothing is done, would the pipe simply be filled with sea water and be rendered unusable? \\n\\nI hope this is the right sub for these kinds of questions, thanks in advance!  \n",
       "1  Mechanical engineering BSE vs Mechanical systems engineering BSE My university offers a traditional BSE in ME at the main campus which I am currently in my junior year of after transferring from a community college, I don’t quite like the classes I’m taking and the ones coming up it’s a ton of theory which doesn’t work with my brain, the majority of my resume includes hands on mechanic work (auto mechanic, aircraft parts technician). The other campus which is about 15 minutes away from my house compared to 30-40 to the main (saving a ton in gas), has an “Engineering BSE with a concentration in mechanical systems”  and reading the description and some buddies who transferred there it’s a lot more hands on classes that I see id do better in but I was wondering what does an engineering de...

In reality (this is not a homework question), the fixed supports are bolts that secure the U-shaped piece with a clamp load. \\n\\nOn the right side of the picture is what I believe the free-body diagram would look like. In application a certain force **Ft**  is applied to the right side of the piece. At the same time, another Force **Fr** is applied to the top of the left side of the piece. I\\'ve applied the unknown fixed support forces and moment at both points a and b. \\n\\n**In real application**, the fixed supports are bolts. And, in application, a large enough Force of **Ft** can cause the bolt (mainly bolt b) to \"slip\", in that the frictional resistance from the bolt\\'s clamp force is too weak to overcome the moment caused by **Ft**.\\n\\nI need to figure out at what force this becomes a problem. \\n\\nI felt like the most logical way to do this was to solve for **Mb**, the fixed support moment of bolt b. And essentially once the Force causes a moment larger than that, the bolt will slip. \\n\\nDoes this seem logical? It seems like I have too many unknowns to solve this, though, and I\\'m having trouble thinking of how the moment at the bolt a (**Ma**) affects this at all or comes into play.'"
