I need some help with a problem that is giving me inconsistent results.

I have two reservoirs at ambient temperature both full of air. Number 1 is a 70 litres full container at 10 bar, number two is a 13 m³ container at 1 bar. There is a pipe of a certain section A connecting them with a valve X in the middle. Both containers are at the same level so we can assume the pressure drop due to height is negligible.

I need the container on the left to discharge completely in a certain amount of time, so I need to dimension correctly the size of the connecting pipe.

I've used the Bernoulli's principle, the Hagen–Poiseuille equation, the Darcy–Weisbach equation, everything I've tried gives me inconsistent results with the flow speed. Everything applies to incompressible fluids, but air is compressible and as such gives me an headache.

14,From Military to Engineering,"From Military to Engineering

Hi, everyone.
As the title suggests, I'm currently in the Army, and I'll be transitioning to the civilian world in a few months.

I (27M), spent about 2 years as a Sergeant, and I don't have much technical skills as I'm an infantryman (combat oriented job). One of the degree programs that piqued my interest is an engineering management degree at a school in the northeast. Ideally, I'd like to major in industrial engineering, but that's the closest that I can get to in the area that I will be moving to (non-negotiable).

I've always had a quantitative mind, loved statistics as a kid, and have always been interested in making things and how to do things in the most efficient way possible.
Also, during my time in the Army, I've earned a Data+ cert from CompTIA, and I'm somewhat familiar with SQL.

However, I have a bit have a dilemma. I've always been told that any engineering program without Calc III and thermodynamics as a requirement is a bullshit degree. The degree in engineering management only requires Calc I, and gen physics II. That being said, the curriculum is mostly heavy in statistics, creating efficiency, operational management, and some traditional business courses like managerial accounting and finance. 

I'd love to study in the program, but I'm a bit worried about its job prospects. Although I have some supervisory experience in the Army, and am planning on getting my project management cert, I feel intimidated by the idea of managing a team of engineers as someone without a hard engineering degree or experience. Am I right to feel this way about it? The program is from a reputable school that focuses on STEM, and I've heard great things from the program, but I feel like my degree won't be useful in the real world.

31,making a float tank at home. How do i get 130 pounds of NaCl (salt) dissolved and then into a waterbed mattress?,"making a float tank at home. How do i get 130 pounds of NaCl (salt) dissolved and then into a waterbed mattress?


this will be a 'dry float' bed.  I am making my own because the professional version is about $US 22K.



I'm using a king size full wave waterbed mattress in a twin bed size frame. The extra, loose vinyl of the mattress will be pulled up on to the top, and the bottom layer of the mattress (over the heater) will be unwrinkled. The salt in the water and the extra, loose fabric on top will allow my body to sink below the surface of the water and stay buoyant,  and not 'run aground' on the bed frame. Floating, but staying dry.

the professional model is constructed differently, and I may have to build mine the same way but *if possible* I'd like to keep all the salt water inside a real waterbed mattress - structurally simpler but procedurally more complicated.

My brother is on the autism spectrum (high functioning) and graduated with his bachelors in ME 2 years ago. How does he get his career started in the field? 


He hasn’t been able to find a job for a few reasons: doesn’t know where to start, his Autism (self determination, doesn’t know how to interview). I don’t know how to help either, I’m a nurse and don’t know about his field. For me, after college I knew I had to study to take my state licensing exam to get my RN (registered nurse) license, then I could apply to RN positions in hospitals where I wanted to work.


How do you become an ME? What are the steps? Please explain like I’m 5, I know nothing of this field. 


I want my brother to thrive and have a career. He’s on Indeed, but only gets jobs like FedEx &amp; Amazon warehouse. I have no idea how to help him and it is depressing to see him feeling so lost, and to see my parents feel helpless &amp; hurt.



He has a therapist who he does group therapy with, but that’s obviously not helping. I’ve told my mom for years that he needs social skills therapy &amp; a better social worker to connect him with resources for work in this field. We’re about to the begin the process of finding those 2 resources.


And when I say he doesn’t know how to interview, here’s how one of his interviews went:     Q- How do you handle stress? Brother- I don’t handle it well. I break down.

43,Anxious about changing jobs,"
I’m a civil engineer [F27], I graduated 5 years ago, I worked for a small company for 1 year and then for the last 4 years I have been working for a large company on a large construction project. Even if the project I work on looks good on my CV, the job I’ve been doing is very repetitive and Im not learning much in a design point of view. 
My goal is to work on drainage and infrastructures design and I’m not fulfilling that because Im doing mainly coordination and management over design/ calculations. I was tired of it, asked my bosses to switch project but they don’t do anything so…

I recently applied for a job as a project manager for infrastructures and drainage for the city I live in just to try out. They called me back and I have an interview next week. However now I’m panicking and having anxiety because if i have the job, I’m not sure I’ll be able to take the amount of responsibility for the job. 
I think the city thinks I’m well experienced with my 5 years but I’m not sure I reached the autonomy level they think I have. The job offers a lot of good benefits, they have a union and the salary jump is 25% for me! I would love to take the job but I’m panicking about not being experienced and autonomous enough. At my current job, I have people around I can ask all the time for help when I design something.

At the city I would be part of a team of 7 other engineers but I don’t know if they work together and share informations.
I’m afraid I’ll be alone in my future job because I’ll be considered a project manager and I should know a lot of things. 

But I also heard from colleagues at my current job that a city job is very much relaxed and that most projects are sent to firms. The engineers act as representatives for the clients only. 

Do you think I should take the job if the interview goes well ?
Has anyone been in a situation where he/she didn’t think was experienced enough ?

57,What casues the wavefunction of alpha particles collapse in radioactive decay?,"As I understand alpha decay, the wavefunction of the alpha particle shows that the alpha particle has a probability to appear far enough away from the nucleus to be expelled. This probability is dependent on factors such as mass and (charge?) of the atom. 

However as I understand, the wavefunction of any particle is just a probability of finding any particle in a specific location upon ""looking""(interacting). Why does radioactive decay occur, as I would think something needs to collapse the wavefunction so that the alpha particle can be ""found"" outside the nucleus of the atom. But if this is due to some interaction with other particles (inside the atom or other atoms) shouldn't the wavefunction be permanently collapsed as it is always interacting in some form of another. 

I most likely do not understand the wavefunction enough so any kind of help would be nice!

Right now my work focuses on the foraging ecology of the *cutest* corvid, the Canda jay.  For the previous six years though, I studied the funeral behaviors of American crows. These studies involved trying to understand the adaptive motivations for why crows alarm call and gather near the bodies of deceased crows through both field techniques and non-lethal brain imaging techniques.

96,Why is my humidity so out of balance?,"Problem: 
The humidity in my office area is ~20% higher or lower than the rest of the building.  

Background: 
I work in a building that is separated into two major sections, an office and a lab.  The office area is roughly 5000 sq. ft. and the laboratory is roughly 10000 sq. ft. The front office area's environment is regulated by a large RTU with VAVs that distribute the air throughout the office.  The design of the office is mostly open with an enclosed, centrally located conference room and a few enclosed offices around the perimeter.  The front office doesn't have any dedicated humidification or dehumidification systems and the humidity fluctuates wildly between 15% (winter) and 70% (summer).  

The lab area is divided into five areas.  Each area has its own HVAC system.  Some areas have CRAC units (temp/humidity) and others have heat pumps (temp only).  Our largest open area (the receiving area) in the lab is controlled by a heat pump and has a large garage door that opens to a loading dock.  There is no humidity control in that area, but the humidity stays between 30% (winter) and 50% (summer).  

What could be causing the difference in the humidity swings between the front office and the back laboratory?  

Last week there was a power outage where the power was knocked out for approximately 14 hours.

With all the recent drought stuff happening in the SW of the US, I was thinking, how difficult would it be to build enclosed aqueducts to move water from either all the rain in the Midwest in the summers or directly from the Mississippi river and divert it to the West Coast. 
It feels like every year areas like Texas flood with tons of rain, but California, Nevada, Arizona and the like suffer from drought. Surely there's a way to divert the water.

100,Do I lose half of my motor's power and/or torque due to using a gear/sprocket with a bigger diameter than the shaft diameter?,"Designing a transmission system here, not a hw question, I graduated a while ago - not that that's helping me right now.

Let's say I have a motor with these specs:
Max Power: 7000Watts
Max Torque: 17Nm
Shaft diameter: 12mm
Max Current: 148Amps
Max Volts: 14S

If I attach a sprocket with a diameter of 24mm to the motor's 12mm shaft, does that mean the sprocket will transmit only 8.5Nm of torque? (8.5Nm = 12mm * 17Nm / 24mm)

I know if you wind a spool around a drum, the torque the motor exerts on the winding lessens as the wire increases the overall radius of the drum. So.. using the same thinking process.

I am interested in companies like Relativity Space, Lockheed Martin, Sierra Space, ULA, and others. I don't have direct connections, so I haven't had too much luck yet aside from a recent screening interview with one company that makes me believe that my resume is hopefully strong enough.

To increase my chances of finding a space-related position, I have started to consider messaging recruiters for these companies on LinkedIn instead of just applying to a lot of positions. I believe that I have the passion to be successful, and a lot of people in my position that I have talked to don't seem to consider this approach. I have read posts claiming that this is a successful method, but I had a few questions before I start:

**How do you find the ""right"" recruiter?** It seems like when you google ""*company* recruiter on LinkedIn"", a wide variety of people pop up. If I am looking at a certain position(s), I fear that I could be wasting somebody's time if they don't deal with the hiring department. In my experience, all of these companies hide any contact information for their postings.

**What can I do to sell myself in the best way possible?**  Aside from expressing your interest and qualifications, what else should/shouldn't you include? I don't want to come off as phony, desperate, or anything else especially as an entry level engineer.

I appreciate any advice that you have.

I doubt anyone reading is new to these terms in 2022.

In our post-pandemic world, the debate over whether location- and time- flexible employment works for the office masses is now in full swing. Opposing opinions are quick to form, most with their own agendas.
In technical environments, common themes appear. 
""WFH allows me to boost my productivity by working undisturbed.""
""WFH makes learning from colleagues impossible.""
""Improved teleconferencing makes working with remote partners easier.""
""I worry about training graduate engineers remotely.""

The reality that one size does not fit all is a hard pill to swallow. Employers are left with difficult decisions, limited research to support them, and often lose valued resource to competitors more willing to take risks.

In my research study, Motivation in Flexible Working and Technical Environments, I aim to put a dent in the unknowns of our ""new normal"" - exploring the key nutrients that feed motivation and by extension, productivity and well-being.
The core aim of the study is to develop recommendations to employers and employees that can both be applied and researched further, into sustainable flexible working practices.

For my research to hold good weight, I NEED YOUR HELP.
I need respondents; employees in technical environments who work or have worked flexibly, who understand and hold opinion in the themes I am exploring. I need demographic breadth across age, gender, experience, industry, and function.

134,Why is the single-strand nanopore DNA sequencing method so error prone?,"I just read that a relatively new method of DNA sequencing - passing single strands of DNA through a nanopore, without requiring Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification - can do very long DNA reads, but also that it is very error prone compared to traditional methods. I also read that this method preserves epigenetic information, like DNA methylation which inactivates certain genes. So far, so good.

Then I stumbled upon  [this Nature Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4060), which tells us that post-reading protocols can effectively reduce the error rate, leaving us with an effective accuracy of 99.88%.

This is what I don't get. If longer chains can be read with single strand sequencing, wouldn't that make the method more accurate, compared to traditional sequencing methods?

**Where exactly do the errors come from**, and why do we need to use complicated protocols to reduce the error rate in the first place?  Does the assembly process have anything to do with it?

Also, I'd be grateful if someone explained to me what exactly is the difference between the specific methods developed by Oxford Nanopore(tm) and PacBio(tm), which seem to be the ""Big Two"" competing in this field. Is there a freely available site or article that explains their differences?

136,"AskScience AMA Series: I'm Dr. Allison Kirkpatrick, an expert on supermassive black holes, and discoverer of the newly defined Cold Quasars. Ask Me Anything!","I'm an assistant professor of astrophysics at the University of Kansas. I search for supermassive black holes, particularly in the distant universe (lookback times of 7-12 billion years ago), in order to figure out what effect these hidden monsters are having on their host galaxies. Most of my work has been centered around developing techniques to find supermassive black holes that aren't very active-their host galaxies are still in the prime of star formation.

Recently, I stumbled across the opposite scenario. I found a population of the most active supermassive black holes out there. These black holes are so active that we normally would not expect their host galaxies to be intact and forming lots of stars... and yet, they are! I coined this population ""cold quasars"" due to the amount of cold gas and dust they have.

To preface: my degree is in chemical engineering, but out of college I got a job as a systems integrator so therefore have been doing automation/controls engineering since. 

As many automation peeps could vouch for I’m sure, this field can be unstable between needing to travel for project work, dealing with unpredictable construction schedules that then affect my personal life when traveling/on-site time is involved, etc. 

I guess I just want more stability in my life. I want a job where I can go to the same place everyday M-F, not have to worry about traveling here and there for different projects with almost no notice (or traveling at all for that matter), not have to worry about frequent last minute schedule changes on-site that would affect me/my personal life in regards to making accommodations for making it to site (i.e. scheduling a dog walker but schedule changes with a 18 hour notice or less and now I have to pay for cancellation of dog walking service), etc. I just need routine really.

Side thought, would making the transition to automation/controls on the client side alleviate this chaotic scheduling situation and onsite/traveling aspect versus staying as a systems integrator?

I’m looking for advice on what other types of engineering positions in other engineering fields that my skills would be transferable to to make this change for a better work/life balance that I so desperately need.

Please refrain from judgment if you could, I feel pretty lost/stuck.

A common theme reported is that fertile hybrid formation seems to be associated with ecotones, zones of overlap in species that once had ranges completely separated.  Fertile hybrids can result where there is a wide difference in number of chromosomes between parent species.

This leads up to my OP question, is there any evidence to suggest that modern humans, *Homo sapiens*, has origin as a fertile hybrid species of two proto-human Hominid species that once had allopatric distribution that over time came to overlap, I assume in Afirica ?   

EDIT TO OP:   Looking at a few Hominid timelines, and assuming *Homo sapiens* can be traced back in time ~200,000 - 220,000 years as suggested from genetic studies, there are a few possible paths for a fertile hybrid origin:

Then you can get up to bigger scales, to things like cell types. Like, will there ever be a descendant of animals that has no neurons? It seems like, since neurons first evolved, they are *stuck*. I read a paper a while back on similarities between invertebrate and vertebrate neurons, and was amazed. They even use more-or-less the same neurotransmitters (if in different roles).

Then bigger: since insects invented wings, virtually none of them have lost them (ants, sort of - and a few other very weird examples). And insects always have that exoskeleton and always will - no insect will ever evolve with an endoskeleton, right?

And how tetrapods all have this 1-arm-bone then 2-arm-bone then lots-of-bones plan for their arms and legs. It seems like that just will never go away (though you might lose your arms and legs, like a snake, if you have them they always follow that plan).

181,AskScience AMA Series: I'm Giulio Guzzinati and I use transmission electron microscopes to look at the nanoworld and play around with the wave functions of electrons.,"Hi Reddit!

I'm a physicists who works with with electron microscopes, particularly transmission electron microscopes (or TEMs), to look at the nanoworld and/or play around with the wave functions of electrons.

I'm originally from Italy and I work in EMAT, an electron microscopy laboratory in Antwerp, Belgium. Here ~[70 researchers][3] can use 6 TEMs study a wide variety of materials science topics, from the cathodes of Li ion batteries to the mechanics of shape memory alloys, from magnetic ceramic oxides to nanoparticle catalysts.

Why do we need electrons to image the nanoscale?
The resolution of conventional optical microscopes is limited by the wavelength of the light used (0.4 µm for blue light).
Electrons however are also waves, and fast electrons (i.e. accelerated with a tension above, say, 30000 Volts) have an extremely short wavelength, of only a few picometers.
Using electromagnetic fields we can steer and focus these electrons beams just like we do on light by using glass lenses.
We get resolutions all the way down to 0.05 nm, that is a twentieth of a millionth of a millimeter (or 2 billionths of an inch in freedom units).
This is such a good resolution, that it allows us to even look at the [atoms that make up solid materials][1]!
(No, seriously, how cool is that??)
We use these capabilities to study the link between the microscopic structure and shape of materials and their macroscopic properties.

My personal focus is on the development of methodologies, that is I try to find ways to use or misuse electron microscopes to measure the proporties of the samples with better precision, clarity or even study things that we couldn't before.
For instance, I recently demonstrated a [new method][4] to measure deformations (strain) in materials with nanometer resolution with a precision of up to 1 part in 5000, which is very important when prototyping or producing semiconductor devices.
A more exotic interest of mine is that of wave function manipulation.
Since the state and properties of the electrons are defined by their wavefunction, we can give them new and interesting properties intentionally changing the wavefunction. It's a bit like having a quantum sandbox.
I did plenty of research on [electron vortex beams][5], a weird type of beam rotating around its own axis which therefore possesses it's own [magnetic moment][6], and interacts with mangnetic fields in a peculiar way, but also others such as the [Airy waves][7], which possess freakish properties such as accelerating in absence of external forces.

If you want to know more about my research, here is my [Google Scholar][8] profile, all of my articles on the [arXiv][9].

I will be here between 12:00 EST (17:00 UTC, 18:00 CET) and 16:00 EST (21:00 UTC, 22:00 CET) to answer your questions.

230,Would impact/energy absorption depend on material volume?,"Hey all,

I'm looking into making a video game system that's relatively realistic.  My current understanding is that once a material reaches it's ultimate tensile/compressive/shear strength, it will break (sometimes deforming further, depending on elasticity).

So if I subject a material to a force, wouldn't it depend on the size/volume of the material?  For example, wouldn't a 1cm thick piece of glass break much easier than a 1m thick piece of glass, despite having the same ultimate tensile/compressive/shear strength?

241,Is there such thing as a double Gamma function similar to the Double Factorial?,"After watching [blackpenredpen's latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imcooZyo4vE&amp;lc=z23yc1makpqodrhfsacdp435neaw1znbbormorii5ptw03c010c.1521647053424468) I was motivated to try to derive an analytic function for double gamma that would extend the double factorial to non-integer numbers.    
I came up with the following: (i don't see this in the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_factorial)     
     
Define the Double Gamma Function Γ² (x)=( 2\^((x-1)/2) \*Γ((x+1)/2)\*sin²(π/2\* x) + 2\^(1-x/2)\*Γ(x)/Γ(x/2)\*cos²(π/2* x) ) / √( 1+k*sin²(πx) ) where k~0.0127996745295915     
     
This has all the properties we want of the double factorial including:     
  -   Γ²(n+1)=n‼;   (Double Gamma equals Double Factorial for integer values of n)     
  -   Γ²(x+1)*Γ²(x)=Γ(x+1);   (same relationship as double factorial, n‼*(n-1)!!=n!)     
  -   expand double factorial to all real numbers except on the poles that are located at the negative even integers     
  -   Γ²(0+1)=1;   so 0!! = 1     
     
Here are values of x, Γ²(x+1) and Γ²(x+1)*Γ²(x)=Γ(x+1) for 0 to 7 incrementing by 0.5     

x | Γ²(x+1) | Γ²(x+1)*Γ²(x)=Γ(x+1)

My main questions are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

\-What exactly is the role of someone with an MS in an NL? I don't have research experience, but the duties seem interesting. 

\-Is it better to start out technical and then decide if I want to pursue an industry role (in manufacturing)?

\-For those of you with an MS, how did you guys decide whether to go for the industry or NL route and did you like it? It seems that NL roles pay less but are more interesting, while industry roles can lead to higher salaries, but tend to be less enjoyable (ESP for QE).

\-I am worried/paranoid about choosing the NL role, turning down the QE position with the brand name company and in the city of my dreams, and then not getting the S Security clearance for whatever reason. Any advice with that in mind?

\-If I am more concerned about $$$, should I go the industry role and hop around internally a bit to get a feel for the manufacturing industry? Like will that help in terms of future prospects? 

\-Would my MS be for nothing if I choose to go the industry route?

At the [discharged state](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sCMe5.jpg) of a supercapacitor, with ions spread uniformly within the electrolyte, and not connected to a power supply, only forming a circuit with a resistor. Wouldn't it be possible to separate the charges using an exterior magnetic field? 

Accelerating a [2000F capacitor, in a strong magnetic field](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1kKdu.jpg)(1T+) would give rise to a [Lorentz force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force)(**F = q(E + v) x B**)  that would separate the positive/negative ions wouldn't it?

I also think, that if the capacitor was intially charged then connected to a circuit and moved rapidly in that strong magnetic field, the discharge would be affected due to the Lorentz force acting on the (+&amp;-)ions?

290,Electric water heating tap stops working when turning on the water in another room,"Hi everyone,

I am doing some work in my house and I have an issue. My home runs on a gas boiler which heats the water. I decided I want to install electric water heating taps in my kitchen because it heats faster than the boiler. It's like a normal tap but only connected to the cold water pipe and then heats the water using an internal resistor. My issue is as follows:

With the electric tap moved to the hot water position it delivers hot water. If I go to my bathroom and turn on the classic tap on hot water( with is connected to both the hot and cold pipe coming from my boiler, as in this one is not electric) the one in the kitchen stops working. It has a digital display that shows the temperature and disappears and only cold water comes out of it.  

But here is the interesting part, the electrical tap stops working only when the boiler starts to heat the water.

I troubleshot the electrical installation and everything is fine. I genuinely do not understand what or why this is happening.

If any of you have any ideas or more questions, comment here.",electric water heating tap stop work turn water room hi work house issue home run gas boiler heat water decide want install electric water heating tap kitchen heat fast boiler like normal tap connect cold water pipe heat water use internal resistor issue follow electric tap hot water position deliver hot water bathroom turn classic tap hot water connect hot cold pipe come boiler electric kitchen stop work digital display temperature disappear cold water come interesting electrical tap stop work boiler start heat water troubleshot electrical installation fine genuinely understand happen idea question comment,0.7591085594268768,0.24089144057312342,AskEngineers,AskEngineers
291,"Does plate tectonics affect the generation of magnetic fields within a planet? If so, how?","I was reading an [article](http://www.astronomynotes.com/solarsys/s7.htm) earlier, which states the following:
&gt; The reasons why Venus does not have a global magnetic field are that it spins very s-l-o-w-l-y (about once every 243 Earth days!) and the absence of convection in the liquid core (probably because of the lack of plate tectonics for the past half billion years).

I understand that Venus's slow spin is responsible for its lack of a magnetic field and that a magnetic dynamo is closely related to the presence of convection currents, but what does plate tectonics have to do with whether a magnetic field can form or not? This article seems to say that Venus lacks a magnetic field *because* it has not had plate tectonics for the past half billion years. Does this mean rocky planets without plate tectonics can't form magnetic fields?

However, when we treat it according to the laws of equilibria, we find that pH 11 Ammonia has 0.0566 M of non-dissociated ammonia, and only 0.001 M of dissociated ammonia. By Le Chatelier-Braun's principle, we know that adding HCl will reduce the amount of dissociated ammonia (and thus of hydroxide ions), causing the undissociated amount to dissociate more. 

This means, in the end, that you will need more HCl than if instead of Ammonia, you used NaOH.

But surely there can't be a direct line from every single network connected to the internet straight to an ISP's servers. They must be combined somehow, but then how can all of the packets be sent to where they need to go? If they go one after another, the network gets backed up with traffic, each client waiting to see a packet for them on the wire. If they all go at once, they surely just blend into noise, as there's no good way to tell which bit belongs to which packet.

Is this not how information is transmitted over the internet?

Hi, I made two very rough prototypes of writing implements designed for left-handed individuals. It would mean a lot to me if you could quickly just give me advice on my design of them. Images of the prototypes:

Prototype 1 - “The No Ring Notebook” 
The no ring notebook is devoid of all rings and instead papers are held in place by magnetized strips bordering the edge of each paper. A series of tabs along the top of the notebook allow you to pick up and flip each of the pages over where the magnet strips will align and come together. The lack of rings will make it easier for left-handed individuals to write in ringed notebooks or binders without their hand having to rest on the rings. 

Prototype 2 - “The No Smudge Bracelet” 
Every left-handed person has had the experience of writing something out and then taking their hand away only to find that their writing has smudged all across the page and to their hand. The No-Smudge Bracelet would fasten to the wrist and having a connected lightweight pad that would follow the hand along while writing, in order for the hand to rest atop the pad to reduce smudging.

* Did the electrons lose some ""kinetic energy""? (Aren't they always moving at lightspeed though?)

* Did the electrons lose temperature? (Do electrons *even have* temperature?)

According to [this article in The Week](https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2020/05/05/french-hospital-retests-old-samples-discovers-covid-19-case-from-december.html), French scientist re-tested samples from pneumonia patients at a hospital and got a positive match as early as December 27, 2019.

In [another medrxiv abstract](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.20140731v1) Brazillian researches report detecting COVID in two sewage samples in Santa Catalina/Florianopolis as early as November 2019.

I know for flat big screens meant to be seen as a whole and not in isolated segments, 4K already pushes our eyes' ability to decern details. Is it the same for big screen light field TVs?","**Background**

I find 3D light field imaging fascinating. I'm well aware that overengineering to appeal to ""techies"" is a practice worth questioning. I personally value what's superior based on correctness and not confirmation bias. It's believed that for flat screens, 8K input is only useful for improving 4K output to the end product and not as an end output of its own.

I know with still pictures like broad landscapes, it's common for advanced users to make it enticing to walk up and view the fine details in segments. In portraits, handling of lower contrast fine detail matters too. Subtleties and overt details matter. It's why I see value in resolution line charts with two extremes in contrast ratio: 1:1.6 and 1:1000

**Questions:**

1. From a 20/20 vision human eye perspective, how high of a resolution for a 3D light field motion picture display would push our eyes' ability to see overt and subtle details?

I'm a very fresh graduate of mechanical engineering with an intergrated Masters from the UK London. I took mech because i thought it was a jack of all traits that can get me into lots of fields. With covid I had alot of difficulties getting placements and work experience. After 2nd year I've applied to nearly 60 places, no luck. I thought it was my academics, im not really the smartest so i  stuffed my head in the books. After 3rd year similar story ive applied to loads, then 1 place accepted me but canceled soon after. I was pretty sad after that. quite a few friends got placements and jobs and graduate schemes. they where happy, i was envious. But, i rationalise it cause of covid and all. So other than working in a messy machine shop at the boat yard, and working on my lil projects. I dont have any industry experience. So i stayed on with my friends and did the intergrated masters, it was a good deal cause the university have like a discount on tuition. £6000 instead of the standard. All-in-All i was pretty down and broke, as usual. I networked met a lady high up in consumed appliances we where both scottish so we chat. though never got a job at the end of the ordeal but it opened my eyes to NPD engineering.

Since I handed in my dissertation, i've got a job doing CAD, draughting and planning for a company doing telecoms towers, which i start soon. Even though i still have exams. But from my experience of getting so many rejections when applying for placement, I jumped the gun and took the first job that accepted me. It pays alright £25000/year for a fresh MEng grad isnt to bad with no experience. But i kinda regret it, i keep thinking if the grass could have been greener if  waited. Its a 45hr week, and it takes 1.5hr to get there. I dont have a car or licence nor the money to afford either. hey beggers cant be choosers.

Though i want to me more involved with Aerospace and Product design, i feel like i stepped into a field thats abit far from them. I want to be making and testing and improving prototypes and i dont really know what it takes to do that as a job. i think my portfolio is quite dry cause i never really taken pictures of my work and alot of my engineering works have been in CAE, FEA, CFD from assignments.

392,AskScience AMA Series: I'm a cancer doc and I’m trying to use fecal microbiome transplants to boost cancer immunotherapy. Ask Me Anything!,"Hi Reddit!

I’m Dr. Diwakar Davar, a physician-scientist at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center and the University of Pittsburgh.

Cancer immunotherapy, which uses the body’s own immune system to fight tumors, has forever changed how we treat cancer. But despite its success across many types of cancers, only about 30-40% of patients respond to immunotherapy. If we find out why this happens, we can help more people benefit, either by developing new therapies or choosing patients that are more likely to benefit from existing treatments.

The gut microbiome has been implicated in seemingly unconnected states, ranging from the response to cancer treatments to obesity and a host of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, depression, schizophrenia and autism. Recent research including my own has suggested that species and relative populations of microbes in our gut have been linked to the success and failure of multiple cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and cancer immunotherapy.

Together with my Hillman and Pitt colleague Dr. Hassane Zarour, we asked if we could identify and use fecal microbiome transplants (FMT) to alter the gut microbiome of cancer patients who had previously failed to respond to anti-PD1 immunotherapy and convert them into responders. In a small first-in-human trial, we found that this was indeed the case, a tremendously exciting finding. What does this mean for the future of cancer treatment? We think altering the gut microbiome has great potential to change the impact of immunotherapy across all cancers. We still a ways to go, including getting more specific with what microbes we transfer. Ultimately, we want to replace FMT with pills containing a cocktail of the most beneficial microbes for boosting immunotherapy—but
there’s still a lot of work to do before we get there.

397,What makes elementary particles and atoms physically solid?,"To my understanding, elementary particles are mostly disruptions in the various boson fields. I do not understand much but am looking for a very dumbed down explanation thanks.

So the various field interactions create what we know as quarks and whatnot which make up protons/neutrons etc... And I'm pretty sure interactions in the Higgs field is what gives particles their mass.

But what makes that mass 'volumetrically' solid, so that other matter can't pass through it like electromagnetic waves? (I think they can to a degree)

I am thinking, why can't mass just be a disturbance in the fields without anything showing for it? 

If the answer is just ""because"", would it be possible for there to be mass in a vacuum without any physical space being occupied? Like a standalone interaction with the Higgs field? Excluding singularities even.

Thanks very much.",elementary particle atom physically solid understanding elementary particle disruption boson field understand look dumbed explanation thank field interaction create know quark whatnot protonsneutron etc pretty sure interaction higgs field particle mass mass volumetrically solid matter pass like electromagnetic wave think degree think mass disturbance field answer possible mass vacuum physical space occupy like standalone interaction higgs field exclude singularity thank,0.008332194282807423,0.9916678057171923,AskScience,AskScience

419,Starting new job and already thinking about career switch. Need advice/encouragement.,"Hi all,

I'm currently in a position where I am frantically thinking about my career and what I really want to do in life. Late last year I got the news dropped on me that I would not be getting funding for a PhD (basically it was a 50/50 chance as my advisors expected finding proposal was rejected, so he was looking for other options for me). As an international student who was faced with uncertainty and couldn't even think about being sent back home to poverty, I just looked for the easiest job I could get- and found one in Geotechnical Engineering, which I had some internship experience in while in undergrad.


I don't like it but I also don't hate it, I just know that I have potential for so much more and it pains me to feel underpaid when I feel like I am capable of way more than this. During my Masters degree, I took several classes on mechanics, proof based math, fracture modeling, finite element analysis, etc. Stuff I thought I would use in my PhD in Geomechanics. I also did research on continuum fracture models.


Now I feel like I'm throwing all that away to be back in the field doing civil engineering. I was told that after a year of working in the field, I'd get to do finite element simulations in Geotechnical Engineering but I'm not sure if I'm content with that, especially with the salary I'll probably be making.


I talked with a friend about it and was considering just selling my soul and looking for a software engineering job, since I'm proficient with C++ and Python. I would probably have to do some months of prep to be CS interview-ready but it's a path I could take. But my friend suggested another route which I'm strongly considering- transitioning to mechanical engineering. I would need to learn to use industry standard software since most of the stuff I did in school was research based. And I guess I would need to learn some other things that are more relevant for ME stuff like product design and all that. With this I could maybe get a much better paying job at, say, Apple? Tesla? I definitely will not leave my Geotech job if it isn't for something much better paying.


But yeah these are the thoughts I'm struggling with. Is it a good plan? I also feel guilty for thinking like this even though I literally just started a new job. Also, is there anything I'm overlooking? It's a medium-term plan so I need to have a clear outline of what I'm doing or else I'd be setting myself up for failure.",start new job think career switch need adviceencouragement hi currently position frantically think career want life late year news drop funding phd basically    chance advisor expect finding proposal reject look option international student face uncertainty think send home poverty look easy job find geotechnical engineering internship experience undergrad like hate know potential pain feel underpaid feel like capable way master degree class mechanic proof base math fracture model finite element analysis etc stuff think use phd geomechanic research continuum fracture model feel like throw away field civil engineering tell year work field finite element simulation geotechnical engineering sure content especially salary probably talk friend consider sell soul look software engineering job proficient c python probably month prep cs interviewready path friend suggest route strongly consider transition mechanical engineering need learn use industry standard software stuff school research base guess need learn thing relevant stuff like product design maybe pay job apple tesla definitely leave geotech job pay yeah thought struggle good plan feel guilty think like literally start new job overlook mediumterm plan need clear outline set failure,0.9994808237469288,0.000519176253072338,AskEngineers,AskEngineers

438,Electrical Engineering Major Options for Antarctic/Arctic Research Expeditions?,"Incoming College Freshman

Major: Electrical Engineering

Dream Job: NASA Astronaut &amp; Engineer

Other interests: Programming, simulation and game development, robotics, space 

I am considering minoring in Earth Science in addition to my engineering major, which will allow me to take classes in ecology and oceanography, among others.  If I can handle two minors, I would also like to complete a Physics minor, and if not I plan on taking as many Physics classes as possible, some of which are already part of my major, of course.

I then intend to earn a Masters of Engineering degree in Robotics in addition to something earth science related if I can find a good interdisciplinary program.  My main academic and professional focus is on engineering and computer science (I LOVE coding and the idea of being a roboticist who can handle both the hardware and software sides of things).  I have read that a lot of electrical engineering majors can easily go for software/coding jobs as well so that is another reason why I chose it (versatility); I plan on continuing to build my coding portfolio as well in the coming years.

Outside of that, I have an eager interest in contributing to Antarctic/Arctic Research Expeditions, and have even been considering joining the NOAA Corps at some point.  I have been reading about remote sensing and GIS, which is somewhat related to my major in terms of machine learning and signal/image processing so I am wondering if completing a certificate program while I complete my masters degree would be worth it in the future.

One can illustrate this with the pack of playing cards. Consider first the Ace of Spades. This looks the same only if you turn it through a complete revolution, or 360 degrees. It is therefore said to have spin 1.

On the other hand, the Queen of Hearts has two heads. It is therefore the same under only half a revolution, 180 degrees. It is said to have spin 2. Similarly, one could imagine objects with spin 3 or higher that would look the same under smaller fractions of a revolution.

The higher the spin, the smaller the fraction of a complete revolution necessary to have the particle look the same. **But the remarkable fact is that there are particles that look the same only if you turn them through two complete revolutions. Such particles are said to have spin 1/2.**” – Stephen Hawking, *The Universe in a Nutshell* pg. 48

455,"Downgrade a leve within company to change career path, or stick it out and find something that progresses my current career path.","I work at a major defense company and have been working on a team that does some field work, a lot of paperwork, metrics, and some rudimentary data analytics, so mostly all over the place. I've learned a small bit of everything here but haven't gotten really good in anything in particular. I recently got moved to a new data analytics team with the intention of more focus on just data analytics, but it has been a disaster. There's no focus on what work should be done, there's no direction for the team, there's a lot of infighting over what we are supposed to be doing as a team, and frustration over management.

I've been applying to jobs like crazy, but the only one that's given me an interview has been a level 1 software engineering position, which pays the exact same, but is in a much higher COL area. On top of that I don't know how to ACTUALLY code outside of just the various python scripts I've developed. This is a full stack position.

I've been advised that downgrading from a level 2 to a level 1 is a career mistake, regardless of the new career path at this company, for various reasons, mainly the promotion schedule, since I'll be adding even more years as a level 1. I've been thinking about this for a few days and am wondering if this is truly a career mistake. My current team is a field engineering and project management focused, but the new team is very much technical skill based, which i haven't been exposed to. Has anyone downgraded their promotion level for a career path change?

If I deny this offer, I could keep applying to positions along the Systems engineering path, and possibly land a level 2 systems job, which would pay more (about 6k more) than the software 1 job, but there's no garuntee that I get selected for an interview much less get the job.

463,DIY non-captive ball/lead screw (gearbox) design considerations,"Long story short, I'm trying to automate the 1.25lb cover on our dog door and I don't have much experience with ball/lead screws yet. I'm planning on using a single lead screw and a linear rail to help guide it, particularly because the lead screw won't be directly over the center of mass, since the cover is already constrained horizontally by the dog door. The screw itself and the mounting bearings, however, would hit the door on the way up. My hope was to get a non-captive motor/lead screw long enough (550mm) so I could disregard the screw being in the way, but I couldn't find one long enough (at least not in my budget), and I don't particularly want to use 2 lead screws if I can help it.

I figured I could just use a gearbox to make a pseudo-non-captive motor to lift the screw and the cover together, but haven't been able to find anything similar through my brief search. That struck me as a bit odd that I didn't find anything, so before I go buy parts and 3d print a non-captive gearbox, I figured I should ask here: Are there specific reasons why a non-captive gearbox isn't a thing? Is there something I'm overlooking in the concept, or is it just not a thing because it's cheap enough to get a non-captive motor for most projects?

Assuming there's a good reason to not do that, the alternative idea is to move the screw further out from the wall, attach a bearing to one side of the linear block, and the other side of the block would be connected to the cover and the lead nut. So the bearing would have to move up and down with the door/lead nut, but my concern is that one side of the screw wouldn't have a consistently supported end. Is that likely to cause an issue, or would it be fine as long as it's supported on the motor side and 1 more spot if it's properly constrained? Obviously there's going to be a small torque (\~5.6N\*\~1.6cm= 8.96N\*cm) on the 8mm x 550mm screw, is that likely to cause an issue over time or would the bearing connected to the linear rail be enough?

Wanted your input on if a device like this exists, or something close to it. On of our clients, need us to install or 'create' a device that can hold a door in place **automatically** for a maximum holding force of 1000 N (required for a fire safety application specifically for industrial doors). They've asked it to be floor mounted such that you'll barely recognised that its there.

The closest to what I found based on what they've asked for, based on their two requirements were:

1. A spring loaded Electromagnetic Door Holder with a Bolt (that when we enquired can have a holding force of upto 500kg, but needs to be locked in manually, like a foot pedestal. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R1lcLksxrk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R1lcLksxrk))

The only idea on top of my head is if there was a device that magically combined the two devices, it would work, or if there was any way to generate a magnetic force stronger than a spring force, so that it automatically locks in place, when it comes within the field (I hope I'm making sense).",automatic door holder    exist market hi want input device like exist close client need install create device hold door place automatically maximum hold force    n require fire safety application specifically industrial door ask floor mount barely recognise close find base ask base requirement    spring load electromagnetic door holder bolt enquire hold force upto kg need lock manually like foot pedestal     fantom doorstop floor mount base automatically hold door hold force upto    n    idea head device magically combine device work way generate magnetic force strong spring force automatically lock place come field hope sense,0.9499626709682895,0.05003732903170746,AskEngineers,AskEngineers

Therefore, when I let go, the bar springs back more or less to its original length/shape. What is the value of this spring back FORCE that the bar experiences?  Is it exactly equal to the original Force that it took to deflect the bar? That seems too simple.

489,What is the reference frame of virtual particle pair production?,"I was watching a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRcmqZkGOK4) which talks about virtual particle pair production and Hawking radiation.  Around 4'30"", there's mention of virtual particles and a spaceship.  They move on from this idea quickly, but it got me curious.

Is there a reference frame for virtual particle production?  It seems to me that pair production generally is relatively low energy particles (the video suggests it is less common at higher energy), but the energy of a particle is relative to the observer.  Virtual particles which are low energy in one reference frame might be thought of as extremely high energy to someone traveling close to the speed of light relative to that frame.  Are virtual particles always in some particular reference frame?

I suppose another way to imagine this is to look at the Casimir effect.  If I had two close plates in a very fast rocket, oriented perpendicular to the direction of travel, the plates would be different distances apart depending on whether I am on the rocket or stationary relative to the rocket (due to Lorenz contraction).  But it seems paradoxical that there would be different forces measured between the plates.

490,"AskScience AMA Series: I'm Alex Marson and I'm an immunologist at UCSF. My lab is building more efficient CRISPR-based gene editing tools to supercharge the human immune system to fight cancer, infectious disease, and autoimmunity. AMA!","Genetic engineering is now cheap, relatively simple, and pretty reliable - at least when done in a lab setting. Using a tool called CRISPR, researchers can access DNA in live cells, target specific strings of the DNA code to slice out, turn gene expression up or down, or even swap in new DNA. This means we can, theoretically, reverse genetic conditions, modify cell behaviors, and perhaps program the cells to better fight against disease.

If you want an overview on CRISPR and how it works, my university created this animated explainer: [https://youtu.be/iXgU--ugLqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXgU--ugLqY)

My lab is using CRISPR to better understand how the genome controls the functions of human immune cells, in health and disease. We hope to use this research to inform future cell-based therapies to fight cancer, infectious disease, and autoimmunity.

If you're deeply interested in CRISPR, you may have heard of our recent work - we discovered a way to make CRISPR more efficient and flexible in re-writing long DNA sequences in human immune cells, without the use of viruses. There are currently FDA approved gene engineered T cell therapies for certain types of cancer. These cells have been generated by using modified viruses to deliver genes into haphazard sites in the T cell genomes. Improved non-viral CRISPR delivery allows us, effectively, to paste long new stretches of DNA sequences into specific sites in the genome, without having to rely viruses that are costly and laborious to employ. We are working to develop non-viral CRISPR-based genome targeting into broadly useful platforms to make better, faster, cheaper engineered T cells for the next generation of immunotherapies.

495,Being underpaid for career growth,"Hi fellow engineers I want to ask if it’s worth it to suck up being underpaid for 4 years in order to have really good experience on your resume for a better job in the future? 

Background: I graduated with a BS in IE last year and landed a job at a tech company in SV (not FAANG but F150) on a rotational engineering program. For 4 years I will rotate across 4 positions in either Operations, NPI, Logistics, capacity planning, finance, data analytics, etc. I was able to land this position because I excelled at my internship in Data Analytics with the company, and got told from the beginning that the program is mostly offered to people with MS in IE and usually from prestigious universities (I went to a state school). The education difference translates to a ~20k salary difference despite me doing the same job. Usually after finishing the program people get placed on leadership positions and promoted, but if finish I would be promoted to the same position most people in the program currently have despite being a lead and finishing the program and it would take around 2/3 years (if lucky) to catch up with them. 

Dilema: The company notoriously underpays compared with other tech companies but people stay because of the rotations and how good that looks on the resume. Most people get poached from other companies even before finishing and end up at FAANG’s. I am al ready underpaid in a company that underpays, and my thinking is that I just don’t have the leverage yet to think about asking for a promotion (which in others with only BS i have seen doesn’t happen) but I am treating these rotations and my masters to hopefully land a better job later like the rest of the program. However, don’t know if I have the resume with my education to aim for the same positions they get. I don’t know if should try and find another job that pays better or suck it up and hope that the experience makes up for it and will pay more in the long run. I haven’t gotten a clear answer from my manager or HR if they would pay for my masters, but that would be an option too.

Tl;dr: in a position with coworkers that are better paid than me and have more education than me despite doing the same work. Don’t know if stick up to it for a future career growth or find somewhere where things are more meritocratic.

510,Are supernovae radially symmetric?,"First post here so hope I am doing this right?

So I've been watching a lot of videos on youtube about the final stages of massive stars and the resultant cataclysmic space kablooie that follows. The final stages of successively fusing heavier elements, coupled with representing them as discrete shells, and then how the ultimate giant ball of Fe collapses, sits with me odd for some reason. Or rather, how it's depicted? Are coexistent shells the best way to illustrate it? Like is there really a clear and distinct boundary between regions where different elements fuse? Rather than ""this fuses and then this fuses and then this fuses"" aren't they all kind of going simultaneously? Or does the star have to get compact enough to get hot enough to move on to fusing the next element? And then my final question: is the collapse symmetrical? It gets presented as an all at once, from all directions, thing. But does fusion and the gravity fighting energy it produces really cease everywhere all at once? Is it effectively everywhere? Or is the collapse not symmetric and you can get things like directional supernovae that shoot out in one direction first, or more prominently, or where the energy waves interfere with one another in a cool pattern or something?

518,AskScience AMA Series: We're the scientists who figured out cutting methane emissions can avoid 0.3°C of global warming by 2045. Ask us anything!,"Hi everybody

We are the scientists behind a recent UN report on the impacts of methane emissions on climate change around the world. This report is called the Global Methane Assessment and you can download the whole thing [here](https://www.ccacoalition.org/en/resources/global-methane-assessment-full-report).

Here are the headline findings:

The Global Methane Assessment shows that human-caused methane emissions can be reduced by up to 45 per cent this decade. Such reductions would avoid nearly 0.3°C of global warming by 2045 and would be consistent with keeping the Paris Climate Agreement's goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.5˚C) within reach.

Because methane is a key ingredient in the formation of ground-level ozone (smog), a powerful climate forcer and dangerous air pollutant, a 45 per cent reduction would prevent 260 000 premature deaths, 775 000 asthma-related hospital visits, 73 billion hours of lost labour from extreme heat, and 25 million tonnes of crop losses annually.

+ Johan Kuylenstierna - Research Leader at the Stockholm Environment Institute

+ Nathan Borgford-Parnell - Science Affairs Coordinator at the Climate &amp; Clean Air Coalition

Methane doesn't always get the attention that it deserves, so we were pleased to see the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/climate/methane-leaks-united-nations.html), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/urgent-methane-cuts-needed-rein-climate-change-un-says-2021-04-27/), [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56933443), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/06/cut-methane-emissions-rapidly-fight-climate-disasters-un-report-greenhouse-gas-global-heating) and many others highlighting our report - but now we're here to dive into the details.

534,How do convection currents affect how plates move?,"This is partly to help my 8th grade son.  He uses an ""interactive notebook"" which is the biggest piece of crap I have ever seen.  The teacher puts random notes in the notebook without anything that clearly explains anything.  

This is not to be confused with how heat affects density, causing the heat to move up and then down (a separate concept that is clear).  

His science notes state the following:

(1)  ""Rising convection currents cause plates to separate"";

(2)  ""Sinking convection currents cause plates to converge"".

His notes also say that:

(3)  convergent convection currents cause convergent boundaries and;
 
(4)  divergent convection currents cause divergent boundaries.

It seems to me that (1) works with (3) and (4) to either separate or converge plates (not just separate).  However, (2) does not make any sense to me at all.

Are (1) and (2) correct?  If so, how?  The whole premise of tectonic plate movement is that the plates move and create boundaries based on the convection currents.  If the convection currents sink, how can they affect the plates?   If the convection rises, why would it only separate plates?  What if the convection currents are converging or moving toward each other?  

Does everything else seem to align correctly as proposed?  It makes sense to me that the plates act like they are on a ""conveyor belt"", and that 2 conveyor belts can drive the plates together (collision) or apart (separation) depending on which direction the conveyors are running.

549,I'm having trouble choosing between 2 schools for my Master's degree," 

I graduated with a bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering at the end of 2019. After working for 2 years, I decided to apply to get my Master's in Industrial Engineering. I got into all 3 schools I applied for, and now I'm having trouble deciding between 2 of them. I'm talking with my employer about going part time if I accept the first option.

Option 1:

Out of state school, highly accredited ""public Ivy League"" school. Will definitely get better education/connections if I go to this school. It's less than an hour away from my work/house, so travelling shouldn't be a problem. If I accept the scholarship, I will have to go full time(9+ credit hours/semester) during the first 2 semesters.

\- 30 credit hour program

\- $3,300/credit hour

\- $30,000 scholarship for first year

\- Estimated cost: $22,000-$40,000 depending on how quickly I complete the program. Between 9-21 credit hours/semester cost the same.

Option 2:

In state school, still ABET accredited, where I got my bachelor's degree.

\- 45 credit hour program

\- $650/credit hour

\- No scholarships

\- Estimated Cost: $32,000.

\- I would be able to do this program part time and have a lot more flexibility due to this school being \~20 minutes away form my home/work.

I'm wondering if anyone here has some experience with whether the higher cost and lower flexibility for the first college is worth it just for the name. I've talked to people that say that the college you go to doesn't matter and that it does matter. For reference, I plan on using the degree to get into management in my current company, but I would also have other opportunities once I graduate.

(∂T/∂p)_S = (∂V/∂S)_p

The answer I’m looking for is not “the rate of change in temperature respective to pressure at constant entropy is equal to the rate in change of volume wrt entropy at constant pressure”. This I already know. 

What I’m trying to understand is more so the physical implications of these equations. 

For example, the constant pressure heat capacity Cp is defined similarly through a partial derivative as (∂H/∂T)_p. What this directly represents is the change in heat respective to the change in temperature while holding pressure constant, however in a gas it is much more significant when understood in terms of intermolecular interactions; complex gas molecules can absorb some of the incoming energy through their vibrational states/bonds/etc, which therefore lessens the change in temperature due because not all of the incoming energy goes to influencing ΔT.

I am primarily trying to understand this in terms of gases, as the course I’m taking is Physical Chemistry rather than thermo, and so the vast majority of what we’ve been discussing involves gases. However, any interpretation would help greatly.",physical implication maxwell relation thermodynamic example derive enthalpy tps    vsp answer look rate change temperature respective pressure constant entropy equal rate change volume wrt entropy constant pressure know try understand physical implication equation example constant pressure heat capacity cp define similarly partial derivative htp directly represent change heat respective change temperature hold pressure constant gas significant understand term intermolecular interaction complex gas molecule absorb incoming energy vibrational statesbondsetc lessen change temperature incoming energy influence t primarily try understand term gas course physical chemistry thermo vast majority discuss involve gas interpretation help greatly,0.04538915548192047,0.9546108445180763,AskScience,AskScience

574,How do electrons and protons stay in (their orbitals)/(the neucleus) respectively?,"[Old question got taken down by bot because I’d didn’t have a question mark in title, here it is again]

I’ve searched a bunch for this question but haven’t found anything quite exact to what I’m asking so I apologize if this has been asked before.

My question is this: why do electrons stay in orbitals and why do protons stay in their nucleus?

It might be a really stupid question but I had never thought about until my most recent Chem lecture. Also this might be more physics than Chem though with all the subatomic particles and charges and such.

My logic is, this. Okay so molecules will try to reach a state of stability. In methane, the hydrogens and their bond’s want to be as far apart from each other, because the electrons are all negative, and negatives don’t like other negatives.

This got me thinking. Why do the electrons stay ‘close’ to each other in orbitals if they don’t like each other? Protons are even more extreme. Why would they want to be crowded in the center like that if they hate each other? Wouldn’t the most stable state be when the protons explode out of their nucleus and find a electron to be buddies with?

My hypothesis is something like stars and planets. I thought maybe the nucleus is like a Star. A star has a fusion reaction happening inside it, which is essentially an explosion. And the reason the star isn’t exploding outward is because it’s so heavy that all the mass and the gravity from all the mass pushes it inward. So it stays ‘stable’ from the 2 forces pushing in and out. And when the reaction stops gravity gains the upper hand, yards yadda yadda, the star collapses and you get a supernova. Maybe that’s whats happening in the nucleus? Maybe there’s lots of pressure holding the repealing protons together? Maybe the neutrons do something?

And then maybe the electrons are like planets? The planets don’t fall into the sun because when they were formed from star dust they were already going around the sun, and were ‘falling’ toward the sun in a way that their outward going momentum (force making them fly off into space) was “proportional” in a way to their inward momentum (force of the sun pulling the planets in). My physics is a little rusty. I think that’s how orbiting works. Basically your outward and inward force are related in a way that you fall outward more than you’re pulled in, so you fall forward and miss the ground. Ok now to hopefully relate it to electrons.

If I remember correctly, after the Big Bang the first stuff to form were protons and nuetrons who made nuclei, and then the electrons were flying around way too fast to join in because it was about a kjghpillion degrees (sauce: https://youtu.be/xuCn8ux2gbs) and then when it cooled down, the electrons could form orbitals and make some atoms. So maybe their initial speed was the ‘right’ speed for them not to fly away but stay flying around a nucleus.

But even if the electrons orbited because they had their 2 vectors, (inward: attraction to protons, outward: they were flying around quickly) then why would the protons decide to stick? Shouldn’t the repulsion between them be stronger than the gravity pulling them together?

Is this close at all? Is there a reason for this? I’m pretty sure it’s not the same forces as planets and stars because it’s on such a micro scale, I made the connection more as an analogy. Are the micro forces I’m talking about related to the macro ones?",electron proton stay orbitalsthe neucleus respectively old question got bot question mark title search bunch question find exact ask apologize ask question electron stay orbital proton stay nucleus stupid question think recent chem lecture physics chem subatomic particle charge logic okay molecule try reach state stability methane hydrogen bond want far apart electron negative negative like negative think electron stay close orbital like proton extreme want crowd center like hate stable state proton explode nucleus find electron buddy hypothesis like star planet think maybe nucleus like star star fusion reaction happen inside essentially explosion reason star explode outward heavy mass gravity mass push inward stay stable    force push reaction stop gravity gain upper hand yard yadda yadda star collapse supernova maybe happen nucleus maybe lot pressure hold repeal proton maybe neutron maybe electron like planet planet fall sun form star dust sun fall sun way outward momentum force fly space proportional way inward momentum force sun pull planet physics little rusty think orbit work basically outward inward force relate way fall outward pull fall forward miss ground ok hopefully relate electron remember correctly big bang stuff form proton nuetron nucleus electron fly way fast join kjghpillion degree sauce cool electron form orbital atom maybe initial speed right speed fly away stay fly nucleus electron orbit    vector inward attraction proton outward fly quickly proton decide stick repulsion strong gravity pull close reason pretty sure force planet star micro scale connection analogy micro force talk relate macro,0.0008471807685861663,0.99915281923141,AskScience,AskScience

My fear is that I'll get a few weeks or months worth of data into one file and I'll reach a point where Excel creeps to a halt and it takes 5 minutes to perform any one operation. I'd also like to automate the process as much as possible to keep me from getting tied down in tedious daily tasks.

I'd also like to centralize our production figures, which currently are held on the network drive in dozens of folders and .xlsx files, all titled the same thing for a given production line. This makes comparing two data sets from different months difficult, since Excel won't open 2 files with the same name (albeit with different paths). I have a few work-arounds, but compiling it all into one file/location would obviously simplify and clean up things a bit, and allow me to set up a sort of dashboard worksheet which would display weekly, monthly, and annual metrics without having to manually define ranges and cell references. 

I have no experience with SQL or database management, limited experience in C/C++/Java/etc. I don't mind learning python or databases to complete these tasks, but I'd rather not waste my company's time by going in blind.

Can anyone make some recommendations or point me in the right direction on where to focus my efforts? This isn't super high priority but it sure would make it easier to identify areas of opportunity and organize the data to support those observations.

612,[PHYSICS] What other elements (Also hypothetical Elements e.g. Superactinoides) are in theory usable in atomic bombs and what would be their possible radioactive damage to environment/organisms?,"Hello!

Also my english is a bit rusty, so bear with me. Also I'm welcoming any other idea that revolves around a logical explaination for a radioactive infestation of the planet.

**To cut things short:** 
Could it be possible to create a implosion type or gun-type atomic bomb with an undiscovered element or any other element except Uran/Plutonium? 

**And if so:**
Is there one element that ""infests"" the environment for only 200-500 years?

613,i have a question about levers.,"What spawned this question was me mounting a shelf to a wall. I have 2 rails that mount to a wall with arms that would mount in them (sort of like how store shelving works, i dont know the exact name). so each rail mounts to the wall vertically with screws about an inch from either end.

Would it be safer to mount the arms at the top, middle or bottom of the rails? My hypothesis is the bottom but i dont know that i have a scientific basis for this, its just kind of intuition. While i do want to know the answer, i really came here to understand the answer (if that makes you more likely to help or not)

If mounted at the top it would make a 2nd class lever with the bottom screw being the fulcrum and the weight applied to the shelf being the force, pulling the top screw away from the wall, while applying mostly shearing force to the bottom screw.

If i mount it in the middle, the bottom screw is still the fulcrum, but with the force applied closer to the fulcrum, the same amount of weight should be applying less outward force to the top screw, and more shearing force to the bottom screw.

if mounted at the bottom this puts the force as close to the fulcrum as i can get it, which should put the most amount of shearing force on the bottom screw and the least amount of outward forcer on the top screw.

as i proof read this i realize that i almost have 2 levers, the second being the arms that are turning a downward force into an outward force on the rails, with the fulcrum being where the mount to the rails.

i am assuming that the shear stregth of the screws are stronger than the ability of the wall to keep the screw from pulling out. for what its worth this is going into cinder block, and holding a 40 pound microwave, so i'm probably fine any way i do it with the proper screws. This is just more of a case of, I'm neurodivergent and a question popped into my head that i am not entirely sure how to answer and i need to know.

my logic feels sound to me, but i would love someone with the backing of the proper education to verify/correct me.

652,Embedded systems vs Aerospace,"Hello everyone! Currently, I am a third year bachelor of mechatronics student. I really enjoy the study because it is a bit of electrical, mechanical and software engineering. But because of the broadness of the study, I want to specialize myself by doing a masters next year.

Right now, I am struggling to choose a Master program. I was thinking about choosing embedded or Aerospace engineering (Space engineering). Below, I will share my thoughts about these programs.

**Embedded Systems**

Currently, I am doing an internship at a company that builds drones. My task is to create firmware for an STM32 microcontroller that provides an interface between a camera and a flight controller. I really enjoy creating embedded firmware and learning new things. However, I want to do something more physical, like creating control systems firmware for a flight controller, but it seems like everything is already pre-made in the embedded systems industries. I am scared that when I choose this career, the only thing that I will be doing is creating interfaces and drives. I also don't want to sit in front of a desk all day.

**Space engineering**

I want to fuse my interest in exploration with my interest for engineering by choosing a masters in aerospace engineering with a specialization on space engineering. Some people told me that I should not do a master in aerospace because it's too specialized, and I can agree on that. But working with satellites and rockets was always a dream for me. But I really want to work on the control systems, electronics and firmware. Not on the mechanical stuff. 

Can someone please provide me with information about the future of embedded systems and if it's any different from writing interfaces all day.

I am trying to figure out the best way to measure the height of a slope on my property to see if a gas powered pump I have can pump water up to it.

I also don’t know if you need to factor in the distance as well or if it’s purely just height.  

So I was thinking of using a laser pointer with level at the highest point of the slope and finding a tree near the water source.  Make note of the approximate spot of the laser on the tree and then measure the height of the spot on the tree to the bottom of the true.

We all know salt water conducts electricity (and is dangerous) but searching google provides no quantifable info about the useability of salt water as a  conductive channel.

No info on resistance and water heating or other important aspects.

Clearly there are also some saltwater disassociation  risks as electrolysis can  occur and even the electroclyte such as sodium chloride can break down but no where do i find any quantifiable info about the rate of electrolysis at a certain voltage or amperage and thus the waterloss. This is secondary to the main question but are needed  when considering the use of saltwater as a conductive channel  as substitute to say an expensive thick metal wire like copper. You can find this information easily for a metal wire of a certain diameter.

Hence the question.  Assume a non conductive pipe hence the theoretically questions framed as a one inch radius column of salt water. Assume any salinity or preferably point me to a chart showing conductivity versus salinity.

Any insights would be appreciated. This is one thing I just cant find much information on and perhaps someone has some specialized expertise here.

This is very similar to compression used in music recording &amp; mixing. For those who don't know, compression is used to maintain a constant volume in a track - for instance, when a loud kick drum is played, it might lower the volume of the rest of the track to make it sound more smooth.

My intuition tells me that this experience is a result of the brain doing its own form of sound compression. If it were a result of the mechanics of the ear, then I would perceive  the compression to occur on the side of the headphone that's tapped, as opposed to it being directionless.

So, my question is this: is this a studied phenomenon? Does the brain compress sound just as music software does?",brain compress sound currently study procrastinating university building use overear headphone white noise block sound notice firmly tap headphone finger hear loud thud perceive simultaneous dip volume white noise affect perception white noise direction oppose direction tap headphone similar compression use music record amp mixing know compression use maintain constant volume track    instance loud kick drum play lower volume rest track sound smooth intuition tell experience result brain form sound compression result mechanic ear perceive compression occur headphone tap oppose directionless question studied phenomenon brain compress sound music software,0.05572319533609017,0.9442768046639078,AskScience,AskScience

1. On what basis does the industry judge potential applicants for research projects? 

2. What type of work I can expect to get, and is it possible to get an actual project to work on? 

3. How I should proceed. Should I attach an application and resume for that specific company, or maybe suggest possible areas of research?

Additionally, are there are potential pitfalls, tips, position in the company I should contact, tricks, or overall guidelines I should be aware of when reaching out?

Greetings. I never cease to be amazed at the diversity of communities I find here.

As  I was pouring boiling water into yet another fire ant hill this  morning, I came upon the idea that if I could use steam instead of water  I could kill the queen and nest in one application. I'm wondering if I  could put something together that could deliver a shot of steam at 40-60  psi, and at as high a temperature as possible.  There wouldn't need to  be a great volume of steam, just enough to flash boil the interior space  of an ant colony.

I see steam  generators online that either generate without pressure, or are  pressurized heavy industrial units, not particularly portable. I was  wondering whether the combined wisdom of this subreddit might provide  some directional clues.

777,Why do we hear about breakthroughs in cancer treatment only to never see them again?,"
I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:

1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs’ effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media’s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people’s hopes for a cure to get revenue.

2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?

3. What are the major hurdles to actually “curing” cancer universally?

Here are a few examples of “breakthrough” articles and research going back to 2009, if you’re interested:

This neat video is primarily about the relationship between rhythm and pitch, and the guy demonstrates some striking correspondences between these different periodic sound phenomena. Polyrhythms which are easily understood or 'felt', he suggests, turn out to create pleasing pitch harmonies when played a few orders of magnitude faster.

Later in the talk he draws slightly more tenuous analogies to orbital mechanics at the low-frequency end of the scale and the colours of visible light at the high, and one thing that occurred to me is that it seems a strange coincidence that the range of visible colour frequencies for humans extends approximately from n to 2n.

This leads me to ask: Is there any physical meaning to the concept of an ""octave"", where EM radiation frequencies are concerned? If, for instance, a pigment molecule reflects 600 nanometer light especially well, do the physics of colour give any reason to expect peaks at 300 or 1200?

The chief deterring factor from following the approach of a modern photodetector array was that the conversion from analogue output information to intelligible output information seemed like magic thanks to many papers requiring an understanding of single-photon physical interactions with pixels. Which is fine, if I weren't sharing my efforts with 6 other papers that year.

798,How much silica was i exposed to?,"submitted 3 minutes ago * by fragmenteret-raev

yesterday i was bicycling through a narrow corridor spanning 15 meter from side to side and 50m in length. At the end of the corridor a guy was grinding in a concrete staircase, thus the corridor was engulfed in clouds of dust. It took me 15-20 seconds to pass through the corridor, thus i reckon i breathed in 35 liter of air during the time i was exposed to dust clouds.

Ive tried to calculate my exposure with a qualified guess of the mass, which was released during the grinding. I assume 60 mg of material was released into the air and that the silica content in the concrete was 30% . Furthermore, i assume the volume which surrounded the grinding was 27 m3. Thus i get that 60000000 microgram/27 m3=2222222 microgram of material per m3, this i multiply with 0,3 to get silica content=666666 mikrogram/m3. I inhaled roughly 35 Liter, so thats 1000L/35L=28,6.

827,Are we aware of correlations between photons/light/massless particles and causality that would hint at why light travels at c rather than some slower speed (or a converse; see question text)?,"Sorry if the title is misleading or confusing. I guess the tl;dr here is ""what's so special about light that it happens to travel at the speed of causality?"" Is there some intrinsic relationship between photons/particles lacking mass and causality/information? Or is this just one of those ""That's how the Universe works; we don't [yet] know why, or even if there is a particular reason"" ? Could also be a sort of chicken vs. egg question; please read on with my apologies for failing to express these thoughts concisely.

From what I understand, c (~3 x 10^8 m/s) is the speed of causality, or of information. So, if parties A and B are spacelike-separated by some distance D meters, and an event X occurs in the immediate vicinity of party A, party B cannot be aware of that event until (at the earliest) D / c seconds later. So if party B is ~9 x 10^8 meters from party A, party B cannot possibly know that the event X has occurred until *at least* 3 seconds has passed (let's say parties A and B are in the same inertial frame to avoid relativistic effects for now).

Fine; I can accept that as a physical rule of our Universe. There is some finite maximum speed at which information can propagate.

What I don't understand is why light / massless particles are so fundamentally related to causality so as to have an identical propagation speed. Is it because information can be conveyed by almost any conceivable means, so if information about an event happens to be carried by massless particles, and massless particles travel at a particular maximum speed, which happens to be the highest speed we've ever observed, we conclude that causality travels at the same speed?

If THAT preceding paragraph is true, then how do we prove that causality cannot propagate faster than c and we simply remain unaware of any means by which to test/falsify that hypothesis, since the fastest way we know to verify the propagation of causality is via (generally) EM radiation/photons?

Is this just a really extended question about the proof of the relativity of simultaneity and I'm just going about thinking about it in an extremely convoluted, flawed fashion? I am aware of the scenarios postulated showing that traveling faster than light would effectively result in traveling backwards in time, causing a paradox, but don't they all hinge upon the assumption that the speed of light *IS* the speed of causality, rather than the possibility that the speed of light is slower than the speed of causality?

I feel like I'm missing something relatively simple making this a sort of dumb question.

Maybe a better tl;dr: What is the proof that the speed of light in a vacuum is exactly equal to the speed of causality, instead of the speed of light in a vacuum potentially being slower than that of causality, even if we are unaware of any phenomena traveling faster than light (or even if no such phenomena other than causality itself exist)?

841,Conflicted on taking the PE Exam as a Mechanical Engineer,"So currently I am an Elctro-Mechanical engineer working in the aerospace industry. I graduated with my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering in May 2021 and am currently doing my Masters in Engineering Management. Now that I am done with classes until the fall, I was looking into studying and attempting the PE Mechanical - Thermal and Fluid Systems (already passed the FE Mechanical and I registered as an EIT in Texas which allows decoupling so I don't need experience to attempt it). However, the more I look at this exam, the less I am interested in putting in the effort to study for it. I usually only see mechanical engineers who need it for construction/civil engineering, consulting or HVAC, all of which I have absolutely no interest in. All of my managers at my current job as well as my prior internships have said it would be essentially useless for them. I would much rather spend my time doing perhaps doing some freelance design work or taking a course in something more useful at this point in my career like getting my Six Sigma green/black belt or learning a coding language. I have an interest in tech/consumer electronics so I may try to switch into that in the future so these make more sense from my research and conversations with people. 

My only reasoning to take the exam sooner rather than later is that I am afraid I'll forget most of what I learned in my undergrad.

844,Need advice deciding which company to work for,"Hey fellow engineers. A little background about myself. I am 30 years old and have been working as a software engineer going on five years now. I am currently a software engineer to at a survey company making 115K annually. I have been interviewing candidates at my current job and decided I should interview for a company that a recruiter reached out to me about. I ended up getting offered the job. I’m having a bit of trouble deciding what I should do because my current company would like me to stay. I am currently the only front end developer on my team. I used to have 3-4 other teammates but they moved on to other companies. For the last month I have interviewed over 20 developers to come in as Senior Software Engineer II(I’m just Software Engineer II). The company I work for is owned by a much larger company so I’m not worried about the company going under anytime soon. We are very profitable. Here are the details of the two offers I currently have.

Potential Company:
- Startup
-Outperformed expectations last year by 115%
- Engineer Team size: I would be the 5th engineer
- 100+ promotions last year across team of 35
- 125k annual, 5k signing bonus, 7.5% annual performance bonus
- Would need to learn Vue and Shopify
- Full Stack Role
- Been assured they promote quickly if I’m doing good work and that I will be evaluated for a promotion 6 months after starting the company

Current company:
- established company
- Engineer team size- 1 FE, 3 BE, 3 QA
- I have been there for 1 year and was going to receive a promotion in 2 months but will receive it now due to competing offer
- Updated salary 130k base
- We use React which I am very strong in
- Front End role 

Before receiving this offer I have been considering studying for the next three months and then applying to one of the larger FAANG companies. The reason I have been giving the startup consideration is because the opportunity for increases in pay seem like they could increase in the short term.

If you were me would you stay at my current role and just grind it out for 3-6 months while I study to get a job at a FAANG company

849,"Can a panel of adequate stiffness reflect a soundwave entirely, and if so, is the required stiffness wavelength-dependent?","We've all walked past a venue/club, or had a car drive by with the stereo blasting, hearing and feeling the thump. My humble recording studio is the same. Everything under roughly 125 Hz passes through the flimsy drywall/insulation/metal frame and sheet construction... but everything above is reflected (and then treated). *Loosely, my question is;*

**Can the stiffness of a material be enough to reflect the entire force of a soundwave, and if so, is the force of a soundwave influenced by its frequency?**

I am an audio engineer. Outside of what I do for a living, I have very minimal knowledge of complex physics and engineering. Therefore, my more refined question could be entirely incorrect *and I'd be happy to admit it;*

**If a 100 dB SPL wave @ 15.625 Hz (64 Pa | 64 N/m\*\*\*\*****^(2)** **| 6.526176 kgf/m2, with a wavelength of 21.925 m) is obstructed by a 1 m\*\*\*\*****^(2)** **panel with a Young's Modulus E = 191067.055394 Pa, fixed on two edges, would there be a 66 dB reduction in SPL on the other side?**

I assumed that;

1. If 100% ""movement"" in a panel is 0% resistance, and 0% movement is 100% resistance, 50% movement should be half resistance: a 6 dB reduction. Therefore, 3.125% movement should be a 30 dB reduction (remembering that decibels are logarithmic).
2. Doubling the stiffness of the panel would halve the distance that frequency's force could bend it.
3. Halving the frequency doubles the wave's force over the same area (and obviously, the wavelength).

Keeping in mind that human hearing ranges from 20 Hz - 20 kHz and that frequencies above an object's point of resonance are reflected, while those below are passed through, I set a target just below 20 Hz.

Using 100 dB SPL @ 1 kHz and 1 m^(2) panel as points of reference;

* 100 dB SPL @ 1 kHz = 2 Pa | 2 N/m^(2) | 0.203943 kgf/m^(2)
* 100 dB SPL @ 250 Hz = 4 Pa | 2 N/m^(2) | 0.407886 kgf/m^(2)
* 100 dB SPL @ 125 Hz = 8 Pa | 8 N/m^(2) | 0.815772 kgf/m^(2)
* 100 dB SPL @ 62.5 Hz = 16 Pa | 16 N/m^(2) |1.631544 kgf/m^(2)
* 100 dB SPL @ 31.25 Hz = 32 Pa | 32 N/m^(2) | 3.263088 kgf/m^(2)
* 100 dB SPL @ 15.625 Hz = 64 Pa | 64 N/m^(2) | 6.526176 kgf/m^(2)

After working out my target frequency and its force, the next steps of the equation should be;

1. Working out the length of the wave (speed of sound through air / frequency = wavelength)
2. Wavelength x 3.125% = 30 dB reduction in SPL (3.125% of reference wavelength is 0.0107 m)
3. Calculating the Flexural Modulus of mystery material using the difference between initial length of 1 m^(2) panel and length under the load of target frequency
4. Doubling the panel's required stiffness (effectively lowering its point of resonance) until the distance travelled under load is, for an example, the same as 3.125% of reference wavelength
5. Finding mystery material

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;343 metres per second / 15.625 Hz = 21.952 m wavelength  
&gt;  
&gt;21.952 m x 3.125% = 0.686 m

&amp;#x200B;

|0.686 m / 2 = 0.343 m|64 Pa | 64 N/m^(2) | 6.526176 kgf/m^(2)|
|:-|:-|
|0.343 m / 2 = 0.1715 m|128 Pa | 128 N/m^(2) | 13.052352 kgf/m^(2)|
|0.1715 m / 2 = 0.0857 m|256 Pa | 256 N/m^(2) |26.104704 kgf/m^(2)|
|0.0857 m / 2 = 0.0428 m|512 Pa | 512 N/m^(2) | 52.209408 kgf/m^(2)|
|0.0428 m / 2 = 0.0214 m|1024 Pa | 1024 N/m^(2) | 104.418816 kgf/m^(2)|
|0.0214 m / 2 = 0.0107 m|2048 Pa | 2048 N/m^(2) |208.837632 kgf/m^(2)|

&amp;#x200B;

# Therefore,  E = 191067.055394 Pa, which gives a 66 dB reduction to 15.625 Hz.

^(As a small side note, coming from a background in audio production, this all subtly reminds me of a Helmholtz resonator's bell curve (centred around its front face and chamber's resonant frequency), above which the soundwaves are increasingly reflected; at the frequency, attenuated by gas flow resistivity built into the resonant chamber, usually by means of a porous absorber like fibreglass insulation; below which, I) *^(imagine,)* ^(ignore the resonator completely.)

***Does this all check out?***

I'm guessing the next step is finding a material with the same flexural modulus and making sure a 1 m^(2) panel is thick enough to support the near 210 kg load without failing. At this point, I haven't worked out what would change if the panel was fixed to the ceiling and also having to support its own weight, or if it was fixed to a wall and had to support an identical panel above it.

The addition of the panel's mass should only lower its resonant frequency, so not factoring that into the equation doesn't bother me. Soundwaves below 15 Hz also don't bother me (in this example).

It seems obvious to me that there is an equation in which stiffness goes a long way in determining a panel's resonant frequency. Mass has an effect, yes, but stiffness can be just as or even more important. I believe it could all depend on the material and what the dominating property affecting it is. So, what is the equation?

*I developed this question out of necessity and, because of that, I only know what I have taught myself over the last few months. I am proud of how far I've come on my own, but I need to enlist the help of people who know what they're talking about. Even if just to say I'm on the right track or point out a flaw. This whole thing is hinged on my list of assumptions and basic understanding of the numbers and equations. It's also the first time I've expressed such an idea in a public space... and I don't even know if it's remotely accurate.*

In my experience, all of these companies hide any contact information for their postings.

896,"Is it just me, or has every company been just understaffed and overworked since 2008?","I've worked my whole life in the U.S. and I'm old enough to have started working before 2008. I've also worked in a variety of places my career, geographically, big company, small company, government, environmental, mechanical, electrical, manufacturing.

I don't know if it's just nostalgia, but I definitely remember that before 2008, deadlines were realistic, and somewhat important. As many articles, studies and memes will tell you, after 2008 layoffs, people were told to do the job of 2 or 3 people. And that never seemed to change in my experience.

Ever since then, it seems like projects are on the tightest of margins. One person going on vacation at the wrong time ruins everything. The people that do things are scrambling to get stuff done the night before. There's no admin help to take care of the stuff like purchasing and travel arrangements, you need to do it all yourself. The modern day engineer is so overworked and overcommited and over-depended on for projects that it's absurd.

And in my experience projects do end up slipping or having bad endings when the single point of failure leaves. No one's loyal to the company and we're all moving around for raises. So latent problems just get passed to the next generation like a hot potato. People develop an existential attitude of ""it's not my problem, I'm just here for 40 hours, maybe for a couple of a years"". Covid has added a whole new level to the malaise of most people.

I understand that this is the most logical and rational and self serving way to work, but it does feel like the pride and camaraderie and sense of accomplishment in engineering is gone. The MBA-style of management has reached it's asymptote, there's nothing more they can squeeze from us. A lot of people have that attitude from the old Soviet Union - ""They pretend to pay us, and we pretend to work"". Some the of the places I've worked have me scratching my head at how it stays in business. I myself have had stretches where I've hopped places, getting raises without ever having produced a deliverable.

Am I just romanticizing the past, or did the way engineering projects are organized at work really permanently change after the 2008 financial crisis?

In some social circles, bringing up topics such as politics and political preferences can easily emerge based on discussion about recent news, or circulating opinions. Creating tension into the environment is a possible result. Office rumors and coworker gossip is an easy one too, which I know to avoid bringing up or spreading.

Topics such as discussing weekend activities, hobbies, TV series etc. are good. I just don't want to stick with sanitized topics that end with constant nodding and going back to the desk. Conversations that breed healthy discussion is what I am thinking of so to say.

905,A question about beyblade for Jade Jupiter,"This is something I've been wondering about and I was wondering how would you go about fixing this.

Jade is a 4D Metal Wheel that consists of a Metal Frame and Core. Metal Frame Weight: 22.3 grams Jade's Metal Frame has a four-sided design that goes in a left-ward movement.

Each side on Jade's Core features an oval-like hole with a metal ball encased inside of it. Since Jade features a Gravity Ball gimmick, the metal balls allow it to do so. During spinning, the metal balls will travel to the outside of Jade to increase centrifugal force, but when spin rotation starts to decrease, the balls will come back to the inside and are used for spin-retaining force, to help stabilize the Bey, and take hits more efficiently. Jade's Core also features four other oval-like holes around it; these holes reveal a purple PC Frame-like object inside of it. 

In theory, Jade's gimmick should provide centrifugal force for extra Flywheel Effect, but its relatively light weight of being less than 40 grams and uneven weight distribution render it useless. Also the Metal Wheel was designed to stabilize the Beyblade at low velocity when the balls shift to the center, but due to poor execution in its design the balls only retreat at the very end of the battle, making the effect negligible.",question beyblade jade jupiter wonder wonder fix jade d metal wheel consist metal frame core metal frame weight    floatnum    gram jade metal frame foursided design leftward movement jades core feature ovallike hole metal ball encase inside jade feature gravity ball gimmick metal ball allow spin metal ball travel outside jade increase centrifugal force spin rotation start decrease ball come inside use spinretaine force help stabilize bey hit efficiently jades core feature ovallike hole hole reveal purple pc framelike object inside theory jades gimmick provide centrifugal force extra flywheel effect relatively light weight    gram uneven weight distribution render useless metal wheel design stabilize beyblade low velocity ball shift center poor execution design ball retreat end battle effect negligible,0.19940171432497072,0.8005982856750301,AskScience,AskEngineers
906,Would the The Las Vegas Convention Center loop collapse if even 1 tesla would burn down in a runaway effect?,"I am not trolling promise, just curius and this seams like the right thread to ask to get a non-biast answer, but I might be a lost redditor and I appologise for that.

So a youtubber called a tesla a chemical inferno on wheels and my first reaction to it was bff... do not exaggerate, but it got me wondering how bad it can be.

So I looked up that Li batteries can burn at ~2000 C and if a catestrofic runnaway effect would happen the pack could go up very quickly... the article I read said it could happen in seconds, but I imagine they meant for small batteries and a car battery would take longer.

The scary part is that most advice on a Li battey fire is to simply let it burn itself out when ever possible, because Li batteries essentialy create their own O2 when burning among other fun stuff.

Anyway then I remembered the Las Vegas loop and how tiny it is, the tesla barely fits and has a ~3.6m diameter or 12ft and in that small space the heat can't dissapate to anything but the concrete or what am I missing?

Anyway then I though well concrete is basically a rock surly it can hande extreme heat? I googled it and no... it starts to degrade at 100C (scary in its own way) and if the temp raises fast enough it basically explodes into bits. I think its called spalling.

On top steal melts at ~1400C. But I imagine that the concrete would have given away and the tunnel would be already collapsed before anything serious can happen with the rebarb.

I do not know, but to my laymans understanding if a tesla should have a catestrofic runaway fire in the loop then yes the tunnel would collapse almost inevitably? What am I missing? I must be missing something big. I am guessing the battery will burn itself out faster then I think and wont be as bad as I imagine. I am thinking it can last ~30-60min, but the following article said it can take up to 24h if not taken care off and I cant see any firefighter going into the loop so maybe I am actually lowballing it...

912,Understanding and choosing the right fasteners,"Hello Engineers,

I am a car enthusiast. I have purchased a tap kit a while ago and I found it very useful. I am currently looking at putting studs at various locations. Since I am now capable of drilling and tapping holes the size I want, I figured I could choose pretty much what I want.

Some background information. Unless specified, all my measurements will be in metric because it's easier for me. I will be mostly working with cast iron, cast aluminum and mild steel from \*insert whatever scrap I can scrounge up\*; engine block, engine heads, exhaust manifolds. Temperatures will vary between -40 and 150. I may see up to 850 on my EGT, but that will be only related to exhaust stuff.

So, I have a bunch of questions related to this.

**Bolt/Stud grade**

I understand grade has to do with ""hardness"", however, I also read that higher isn't necessarily better depending the application. I would love to hear more about this.

**Material**

I'd like to use stainless where possible, if only to prevent rust and stuck fasteners. Anything that will prevent broken bolts is best, however, I don't know much, so I'm open to understanding.

**Thread**

Course, fine, how ""deep"" in the material it is, I don't know much about this. However, thread that will be harder to crossthread or less prone to damage is best. I also have to consider the torque specs.

**Stud/bolt size**

Is bigger always better?

Basically, I just want to understand more about bolt, studs and nuts. Anything useful goes!

It's about 75% hands on/problem solving 25% paperwork, enough busy work that I can occasionally be lazy but usually I'm busy and have interesting things to do.

I'm currently a senior technician and don't have a college degree. There is really no direct promotion I can get. My boss has proposed going into management, I can deal with people and generally I think most like me but I don't like the idea of being responsible for something I can't control. For example say I am responsible for putting on 800 parts this week, I have 20 people below me... 2 people call out sick, I can't control that but because they are sick I can't fulfill my responsibilities and that sucks.

My boss has also recommended planning(setting schedule and telling managers how many if x they need to make and how many of y they need to make). It's not a bad job but also sounds incredibly boring and not at all technical(which I like).

Another option he proposed was supply chain which again is not a bad job but feel like I would hate just negotiating contracts and trying to optimize how much inventory we have vs how much we risk if we run out.

No “tell me about yourself” or common interview questions like that. Then he went on to share his screen and gave me 3 technical questions. I think I did pretty bad on those. My answers were either incorrect or very simple that he expected a lot more to it. When he gave me the correct answers, I was like wow I didn’t think of that or tbh properly could never come up with that because of my lack of knowledge and exposure to the given problems (I’m from a manufacturing environment but with a different industry). At the end, I was apologetic because I couldn’t do it any better and then thanked him for his time. He said “I’ll properly see you again”. I wondered what that meant. 

The next morning, recruiter reached out and said he asked to schedule me for another interview with a different engineer. Now I’m confused, what did he see in me that he wanted to see more of? 

I was told the 2nd round would be a panel interview with 4 people for 4 hours. My interview is going to be 45 minutes with only 1 engineer.

946,Does fluorescence have to involve UV light?,"I'm doing some work regarding fluorescent microscopes and for some reason I cannot get a point to make sense to me.

I get the principle of fluorescence: high-energy (short wavelength) light is absorbed by a molecule and re-emitted as lower-energy (longer wavelength, visible) light. I work in microbiology and we use fluorescent stains to look for some bacteria. The stains are acridine orange and auramine phenol.

The point I'm struggling to understand is that, as far as I understand, the excitation wavelength needed for each of these is 470nm, which is not UV. So I'm confused why we need to use a fluorescent microscope and all the safety equipment needed to operate the microscopes.

Is it because fluorescence doesn't need to be strictly UV, which perhaps is too arbitrary to form a clear distinction? And that the principle is the same as UV fluorescence and so the same equipment can be used? And finally, that intense near-UV light still has risks?

947,"AskScience AMA Series: My name is Dr. Rosalba Bonaccorsi, and I am an interdisciplinary scientist and astrobiologist at the SETI Institute's Carl Sagan Center. AMA!","I am an interdisciplinary scientist and, in 2001, obtained my Ph.D. in Geological, Marine, and Environmental Sciences from the University of Trieste (Italy). I have been an astrobiologist at the SETI Institute's Carl Sagan Center since 2009.  My office and lab are based at the nearby NASA Ames Research Center, which I joined for my NASA postdoctoral research that was focused on the habitability of subsurface biospheres during a robotic drilling mission simulation in the Rio Tinto's underground (Spain).

I enjoy doing science to advance our understanding of the universe we can see and to inspire old and new generations of my fellow humans - from any latitude, longitude, and altitude - to pursue happiness through scientific knowledge, exploration, and discovery.

For the past 15 years, I have expanded my interest to the habitability of mineralogical Mars analogs, in particular as a science team member and field instructor joining NASA's Spaceward Bound expeditions to remote places including the Mojave Desert, Antarctica, Atacama (Chile), Australia, New Zealand, Israel, the Namib Desert, and the Tibetan Plateau (see links below). My ultimate goal is to achieve a broad picture of where life and its signatures are most successfully distributed, concentrated, preserved, and detected. This knowledge helps us to understand how to search for life beyond Earth. To achieve this goal I am involved in a broad array of research, laboratory, experimentation, and field exploration activities.

For instance, I have been studying the distribution of life indicators in Death Valley National Park (California) in support of the Curiosity rover mission and other planned searches for life on Mars. Last but not least, over the past three years, I have been implementing innovative laboratory experiments to simulate the plumes of the Saturnian moon Enceladus and similar environments to support future flyby missions to detect life on distant Ocean Worlds.

More specifically, I have been working at the Ubehebe Volcanic Field (UVC), in Death Valley National Park, where I am applying results from this research to support missions to Mars such as the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission objectives in collaboration with MSL scientists. In Death Valley, I have been conducting long-term monitoring of the weather/climate and surface water cycle, formation, and stability of short-lived water bodies, source-to-sink of sedimentary clay minerals (clays) to support the astrobiology of clays and life detection protocols.

Another project relates to Planetary Protection (PP) involving contamination control plans to clean, disinfect and sterilize spacecraft-like hardware and certifying cleanliness levels using non culture-based biological assays e.g., LAL (Lymulus Amebocite Lysate) and ATP (adenosine triphosphate) Luminometry. The ultimate objective is to prevent biological contamination of terrestrial origin on other planets. I was Co-I of a NASA funded PP project (2008-2011).

I am also passionate about sharing what I do with students, teachers, and the general public. So, I have gotten busy with a variety of education and public outreach projects. In close collaboration with the National Park Service, I volunteered to support Park Ranger programs for several years, culminating with MarsFest Planetary Science events in Death Valley.  I have also led field trips for the Road Scholar Lifelong Learning program for the Death Valley Natural History Association in 2014, engaging senior citizens to explore planetary analogues. As a former elementary school teacher (1988-89), I believe that outdoor, hands-on science education is the best way to go to learn the beauty of the scientific method and that everyone can do it. In addition to being a scientist, I have been engaged and led Education and Public Outreach events with non-profit and corporate organizations since 1989.

Last but not least, I have been involved as an instructor during the one-week Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) summer camp since 2011 and led the Field Program as Director for the past six years.  The REU program is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to the SETI Institute and managed by M. Tiscareno (PI). The objective of the field trip is to engage the REU interns to explore the biological and geological features of extreme and planetary analog environments in the framework of the astrobiology research done at the SETI Institute.

This year, due to COVID-19, I am converting the hands-on field trip into a virtual format. During the AMA day I will be at the SETI ATA facility - in Hat Creek - to visit the nearby Lassen National Park and obtain visual material to share and discuss online with this year's REU Students!

956,Getting out of niche simulation/controls field,"I am an EE that has been working in the simulation/controls field of the power industry for the past 10 years. My current job involves process modeling and controls for fossil fuel plant simulators that are used in control checkouts and to train operators. As you can imagine, this is a pretty niche field. I work at a small company (less than 5 people) and while pay is good, the industry is dying and I've reached my ceiling within the company (I'm the most senior engineer).

I cant really move directly to another company that does the same thing because, well, there really arent any. The ones that do fossil fuel simulation are giant controls vendors that do it as a small service piece of the org and dont really care about it. And the ones that sell simulation software are dying or trying to pivot as a company.

The problem that I'm facing is that I don't see an obvious career pivot. Most of the software I use is very specific to this industry. I could become a DCS engineer or I&amp;C engineer but neither of those interest me. The only positions I see at other companies where I could move into senior roles would be project management positions or possibly some process controls work.

The other option I see is to learn to code and pursue software engineering. This would take some time to get up to speed as I only have some Python and C experience. And going this route would mean I basically start at entry level in whatever form of software engineering I decide to pursue due to lack of experience.

968,Is it worth counter offering a raise that doesn't even meet inflation? (details inside),"Got offered a 10% raise w new promotion. Have only receoved 1% since 2019. Per Bureau of Labor statistics, this doesn't even keep up with inflation. Some other random things to consider below

-last raise 2019 (plus a 1% keep-them-working raise last fall 2021 for anyone they didnt give a promotion to). This, plus the 10% offered (11% total 2019-2022 post-raise), would be a few hundred bucks less than what the new salary offer is - based solely on inflation alone. That leaves zero consideration of an actual ""raise"" for work performance, increased responsibilities, etc.

-I'm less than a year away from time requirement to obtain PE license. My competency assessments place me in a higher role than I'm being promoted to but not yet having the PE License is basically holding me back due to that being one of the expected requirements of the position (oddly, though, we have principal engineers and large project managers who don't have a PE License.....)

-I will be co-leading a team into early '23 on a multi-tens-of-millions in revenue project. We just wrapped up estimates on said project and manually inflated all cost estimates a minimum of 10% because - and I quote - ""everything costs more now"" 

-our ceo got a 7 figure cash bonus fy2021 when company wide revenue was down 50%. The company has downsized physical office locations as many of us WFH 50% or more of the time now. They're not hurting financially, it would seem.

-company has so much work on the table from won job bids that they're having a hard time filling roles needed to keep schedule on jobs. Again, not hurting financially like consumers are it would seem. 

I told them I would be providing a written counter offer next week with explanation of my reasoning. Was told they don't negotiate raises but they'd hear me out. I negotiated 10% with ease in 2019 and inflation and CPI weren't outrageous then. It seems absurd to me to recieve a ""raise"" that comes in just below inflation adjustment of my 2019 salary. It's really not even a raise and just gets me on par with what my salary should already be with inflation. 

I hate being expected to be appreciative for receiving the bare minimim that should be a given in this sort of job title / role and working with a relatively large &amp; international company. I know many people aren't even getting something reasonably close to keeping par with inflation so I'm trying to keep that in mind but no reasonable raise for 3 years only to be offered something that's a few hundred less per year than what my infation-adjusted salary was from 2019 and being told it's a ""raise"" is a bit of an annoyance to say the least.",worth counter offer raise meet inflation detail inside got offer    percentage    raise w new promotion receove    percentage       bureau labor statistic inflation random thing consider raise    plus    percentage    keepthemworking raise fall    promotion plus    percentage    offer    percentage    total    negativenum    postraise buck new salary offer    base solely inflation leave zero consideration actual raise work performance increase responsibility etc year away time requirement obtain pe license competency assessment place high role promote pe license basically hold expect requirement position oddly principal engineer large project manager pe license coleade team early    multitensofmillion revenue project wrap estimate project manually inflate cost estimate minimum    percentage       quote    cost ceo    figure cash bonus fy company wide revenue    percentage    company downsize physical office location wfh    percentage    time hurt financially company work table win job bid hard time fill role need schedule job hurt financially like consumer tell provide write counter offer week explanation reasoning tell negotiate raise hear negotiate    percentage    ease    inflation cpi outrageous absurd recieve raise come inflation adjustment    salary raise par salary inflation hate expect appreciative receive bare minimim sort job title    role work relatively large amp international company know people reasonably close par inflation try mind reasonable raise    year offer year infationadjuste salary    tell raise bit annoyance,0.9980613385673185,0.0019386614326789076,AskEngineers,AskEngineers
969,"Does spacetime stretch, or does it bend?","Spacetime is not static, and as it curves, numerous non-euclidean geometries can and do occur, such as the black hole, where, once inside, there simply is no outside.

My question is: What exactly is this curvature?

I've seen numerous [models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg) portray the curvature as 3rd dimensional curvature in a 2D plane, or, in other words, a [gravity well](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/gravity_wells_large.png), and, having begun to contemplate higher dimensions on an alarmingly frequent basis, I simply extrapolated to gravity being (n+1)th dimensional curvature of n dimensional space, which, on our 3D space, combined with time, gives us 5 total dimensions (which I believe is hinted at in interstellar, as the Gargantua scene features a 5D tessaract).

However, I have heard that this is not the case, that instead, gravity is n dimensional stretching of n dimensional space, lacking any intrusion into dimension (n+1).

As the latter option seems less curvy than the first, and as it is far less intuitive than mere higher dimensional curvature (and, IMO, fails to account for black holes and wormholes), I prefer to think of gravity as higher dimensional curvature. However, I am uncertain if this is actually how the universe works, and I'd like some answers.

TL;DR: To what extent are pictures like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/GravityPotential.jpg/250px-GravityPotential.jpg) wrong?

970,AskScience AMA Series: We are a plant ecology research lab working on the fate of abandoned cranberry bogs. Ask Us Anything!,"Hi Reddit!

We are a plant ecology research lab at Monmouth University. We recently conducted a study investigating community succession after abandonment in abandoned cranberry bogs within the New Jersey Pinelands. Since the 1860's, the cultivation of the native American cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon, has been a major agricultural practice in the New Jersey pinelands. The pinelands have been well suited for cranberry production due to the sandy, organically rich soil and abundant sources of freshwater. Although cranberry agriculture can represent over a third of wetlands in the pinelands, the industry has been on the decline as it has moved to other regions of the country. As a result, many bogs have been abandoned. The effects of abandonment have not been investigated thoroughly. 

In this study, we explored the fate of bogs and examined bog succession after abandonment from time zero (an active cranberry bog) to 60 years abandoned in flooded and unflooded communities. A full inventory of plant and invertebrate species were collected from cranberry bogs of different ages from three locations. Community diversity and structure were determined from the inventories and a chronosequence for bog succession was developed. When a cranberry bog was left to dry, conversion from a wet savanna to either a mesic mixed forest or wooded swamp was observed. A cranberry bog that remained flooded transitioned to a lake, spung, or pond. With this information, recommendations can be made onto how the lands should be managed in the future in order to maintain healthy and native communities.

Ask us your ecological questions and we'll be on around 1pm Eastern Time (17 UT) to start answering! Ask us anything!

One method of doing this would be using a pdelta analysis, however another would be to introduce equivalent horizontal forces. Is this correct?

So my question is basically: Why hasn't anyone made this equipment, where the weight stack is replaced with portable, cheap, springs?

A few points:

1) You can manufacture springs with constant force-displacement output (or otherwise create a coupling that achieves this).

2) Yes, you will need some adjustable 'lever' in your system.

3) Yes, a mass x g x height for - 300kg, 2m - is going to be a lot of energy required from your springs.

If I then wound the coil instead with 200 turns each of the parallel strand to make 400 total turns now, the resistance should be back to 120 ohms and the current draw back to 100ma. Does this mean that if I did this, I cam double the agnostic flux do to double the turns, for the same input current making a more efficient coil?

1047,"If you're immune to a virus, does it still ""enter your system"" before your immune system fights it off, or it is blocked from entry/replication entirely?","I asked this question on a question thread in r/COVID19, but I'm curious about viruses and immunity in general, not just COVID.

To shed more light on my question, I have a friend who tested positive for COVID antibodies over the summer (after presumably having an asymptomatic case at some point), had many negative tests over the past several months, and then tested positive for COVID on a PCR test again a couple weeks ago. Both times she was asymptomatic. Could this mean that the immune system is doing exactly what it’s supposed to do — i.e. the second time she got exposed, her body recognized the virus, fought it off, and she was never actually infectious? **That is, I assume “immunity” doesn’t actually prevent the virus from** ***entering*** **your body, but rather your immune system recognizes it and knows how to properly respond.** So can you have a true positive in this case because the virus has managed to make it into your system again and PCR tests are overly sensitive and will pick up on even a miniscule trace of virus? To get ahead of an answer I've already gotten: she has had many negative PCR tests between the positive antibody test and this most recent PCR test (she's someone who tests periodically as a precaution) so it seems less likely to me that this is one of those cases of someone consistently testing positive for months due to viral remnants.

That all said: **COVID aside, how does this work in a broad sense?** We don't test as frequently or with such high sensitivity for other viruses, but if we did, could an immune or vaccinated person theoretically have a virus ""in their system"" at a level high enough to test positive for it on a molecular test, but not be symptomatic or infectious because their body already knows how to fight it?

I have no experience in industrial distribution/supply chain, but I'm familiar with the market/category and delivering solutions. They are confident they can train me to be successful and bring new products on board.

I interviewed for the role as a lark, I was not really interested in changing jobs since I like my current role - but I know I'm underpaid for what I deliver.

However, now I can't find a reason not to take this job. Salary increase is at least 25% plus bonus, same commute, hybrid work environment (wfh has not been an option in my career so far), similar benefits. I'm the breadwinner in the family, so I feel a lot of pressure to make as much money as possible and a bug bonus is to be around my family as much as possible day to day.

The main thing I worry about is career progression - I have no idea what the career progression is for a category manager.

For a mfg engineering career I knew my next step would be a mfg engineering manager,  but I'm recognizing that won't be a real possibility at my current role for at least a couple years - and my salary won't catch up to this opportunity for at least another 5 years.

Tonight I was tired and distracted and accidentally plugged the USB wall charger into the USB jack of the phone rather than the USB jack of the wireless charger. 

So basically I plugged the charger directly into the phone as I normally would if the battery capacitor were still functional, but I guess since it is broken, the energy built up around the cord?

1070,Flow fraction into a dividing tee junction,"TL:DR; Is there an equation/correlation I can use to determine flow fraction in to a dividing tee branch?

I can provide more detailed flow information if needed, but to keep it simple, I have a 2"" nominal bore pipe, with CO2 flowing down it at 1 kg/s, at a pressure of 10 bar.

I've now learned that there is a dividing tee junction about 1/3rd of the way along the long pipe run, and this branch has a 1"" nominal bore.

Both the main and branch lines lead to two separate outlets that are at the same pressure, and I need to determine the outlet flow rate is at the main branch.

So my question is - since the cross-sectional area of the branch pipe is 1/4 of the area of the main pipe, can I just assume that the flow rate into this branch is also a 1/4 of the flow rate in the main line upstream of the tee? My feeling is that this would be an over-estimate as the flow ""wants"" to carry on going straight down the main line and it isn't as simple as just assuming a linear relation between the flow rates and cross-sectional area ratios.

1080,Questions regarding safety of art installation,"Hello,

Apologies if this is not the right place for this question and for the slightly vague title but I have a number of questions regarding the safety of an art installation I have been tasked to help put together.

The installation requires an 8kg weight to be dropped onto a running server from a height of 180cm. The server measures 70x50x5cm (HP DL360 G6) and has a metal casing. The plan is to create a surround using a wooden palette, and either use chicken wire or perspex. (spectators will be required to wear safety goggles)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Would chicken wire and/or perspex suffice to contain debris, provided spectators are kept at a distance of 5m? 
2. A concern is in the deflection of the rope attached to the weight when the quick release mechanism is pulled (Kong Quick Release 520). The release mechanism will be anchored to a pillar, low to the ground with the rope running up to a beam at the height of 180cm. Will this setup help reduce deflection of the weight? Is there another way to reduce the deflection when the mechanism is pulled to make sure the weight lands where intended?
3. Is an RCD style plug enough to ensure safety regarding the electrical hazard?

1106,Pressure and boiling point?,"Hello peeps,
I have a very basic yet bugging question about water boiling at different temperatures depending on different pressures.

We know that in a vacuum chamber water starts boiling before it reaches 100 degrees Celsius. The same phenomenon happens if we boil water at sea level versus doing if on a high mountain. 

That is, the lower the pressure before it starts boiling.

Again, I beg your pardon for this question as I intuitively understand it is extremely basic and possibly silly, but why we use pressure cookers then? Their function is to raise the pressure, thus making the water boiling faster. 

What am I understanding wrong? If their function was to raise the boiling point so as to cook the food at higher temperatures, that would be consistent with all the rest. However how come pressure cookers start boiling faster?

I get how Ampere's law works for static currents, and I can also follow the mathematical steps that are used to add the Maxwell term. (The divergence of a curl is zero, so Ampere's law always results in the rate of change of charge density being zero. Then adding an unknown vector field to the original equation and rearranging everything using Gauss's law and the equation of continuity gives the Maxwell term of εμ ∂**E**/∂t.)

But even though I can follow the maths, I can't shake the feeling that it's like using the same information twice in one equation. The μ**J** term is the current density, so it represents the movement of charge. And the εμ ∂**E**/∂t term is the change in electric field, so it represents... also the movement of charge? I can't get my head around why the rate of change of electric field means something fundamentally different to the movement of charge, since electric field is defined by the location of charge to begin with.

I've tried doing research and looking for useful analogies and explanations. But I've found a lot of things talking about the displacement current, which all seems to lead to explanations about how electric fields can polarise a medium and cause a sort of opposing field - and I can't figure a way to relate that back to the Ampere-Maxwell law itself in any useful way.

1136,Are there physiological or psychological differences that can cause people to perceive colors very differently?,"So most of my peers (26 y/o and older) don't have a ""favorite color"".  I've personally always found this odd because for me, red is very clearly the ""best"" color.  And I dont mean that as its the color I personally like best from an aesthetic point of view.  The best way I can describe it is that I can almost perceive red better than I can another color like blue.  It just seems so much more vivid.  

I've taken color blindness tests and what not and I believe I have ""normal"" color vision.  But I swear that the color red just always feels, in a sense, more real to me.

This came up with some friends recently when a scene in a movie came on where one character asked the other what their favorite color was.  He quipped back blue, and the original character pointed thats a lie because adults don't really have a favorite color.

Background: I'm an ME pursuing my masters and I've always been interested in aircraft and spacecraft. I especially like bleeding edge technology that comes from the DOD budget and close-knit work culture.

Job 1: Lockheed Martin's Skunkworks in Palmdale: Design engineer for low observable technology. Radomes, antennas, pole models: fast paced new projects. 

Job 2: Northrop Grumman's Space Park in Redondo Beach: Mechanical design engineer for ground support systems. Test stands, supportive structures, mounts, non-flight hardware: more slowly paced, thorough.

1139,RSS tolerance stack up with known Cpk (st. dev) values?,"So as I understand it, the RSS method of determining the tolerance band for an assembly (stack) of parts works under the assumption that each part has a Cpk value of 1.0, which effectively means its tolerance band is equal to ±3σ.

Here is an example I pulled from online.  (Source:  [RSS Tolerance Chain Stack up Analysis – Learn How to Perform Assembly Tolerance Stack up by Root Sum Square Method - Bright Hub Engineering](https://www.brighthubengineering.com/machine-design/56403-assembly-tolerance-stack-up-analysis-using-the-rss-method/) )

    Assume you have 4 plates with thickness and tolerance as follows:
    
    • Plate 1 = 27 ± 0.4
    • Plate 2 = 15 ± 0.3
    • Plate 3 = 15 ± 0.3
    • Plate 4 = 15 ± 0.5
    
    If we assume Cpk = 1.0 then the tolerances are equal to 3σ, so to find the standard deviation of each part, the tolerance is divided by 3.
    
    • σ1 = 0.1333
    • σ2 = 0.1
    • σ3 = 0.1
    • σ4 = 0.1667
    
    The formula for the ""assembly"" standard deviation is the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual standard deviations:
    
    • σ(asm) = sqrt(σ1^2 + σ2^2 + σ3^2 + σ4^2)
    • σ(asm) = 0.256
    
    Therefore, to get the tolerance band of the assembly at 3σ, we need to use 3 x σ(asm), or 0.768. The nominal thickness of the stack is 27 + 15 + 15 + 15 = 72.
    
    Thus us the RSS tolerance band becomes 72 ± 0.768.

My question is this:

What if I have parts that I know the actual Cpk values for, and want to use those to help the tolerance stack? 

For example, say I know **one** of those blocks (say Plate 4) has a cpk = 1.33. 

Then my new σ4 becomes 0.125 (instead of 0.1667) because we divide the tolerance by 4. 

This yields a new assembly standard deviation of σ(asm) = 0.231.

Now here's where I get confused. The new assembly st dev is smaller, which is expected since one of the parts is now more reliably close to its nominal. 

But if I want to find the new tolerance band for the whole assembly, do I still just multiply the new σ(asm) by 3?  Or does it somehow change because not all of my individual components are using a 3σ distribution now? Or does the assembly have its own Cpk, which determines the number by which you multiple σ(asm) to get the tolerance band?

1141,How can I get more work without being annoying?,"So I have an internship at a Acid Gas Plant as their engineering summer student (they also have a new operations summer students). I have been working here since May and have not been given any substantial amount of work.

To begin clarifications, these guys are super stressed out as they are in a turnaround right now and have been since I started work in May. They started out having me scan in drawings and import them into an excel sheet (this ended early since they do not have a large format scanner so I literally can’t scan any in). I have drafted 2 excel sheets and made 1 hand drawing of a Sulphur Pit. This is not much work for 2 and a half months. I pretty much sit in my office and watch YouTube, anime, or look ahead for my future classes. I’ve also written a 38 page paper on everything I can think about regarding the downstream gas plant industry such as processes and flow (this was just to pass time and not something they asked me to do). 

I have asked if I can help before and the facilities engineer usually has to sit there and think up of something for me to do. It’ll be something I can do pretty quickly and he will be so busy with meetings and turnaround things that I can’t show him until the next day. I asked other office guys if the need help but nobody needs anything other than me creating a binder (literally only once and I just made tabs for a binder for LOTOs). Operations doesn’t really need my help either since their jobs don’t require another person and they hired an operations summer student too. They also feel like they shouldn’t ask me since “I am an engineer” (maybe a joke?). All the other things are done by contractors. One time I asked if I could help my engineer with something (literally anything) and I eventually got sent home early since there was nothing for me to do. I used to be in charge of headcount, but they just have everyone sign in on the board now. I do orientations too, but this doesn’t really happen often.

I've been working in academia since I graduated. I decided to switch into industry and have been offered two positions for my first full-time industry job. I'm torn on which to take and any advice would be greatly appreciated!
----------------------
Job 1:

* Research division of a large company that's known worldwide, but seems to have a dying reputation
* Salary: $97k + $7000 sign-on bonus
* Estimate of housing costs (for cost of living comparison): $1800/month in rent, $250k-400k houses
* Moving: $6500 lump sum for moving (my moving expenses won't be much, so I could pocket a lot of this)
* Retirement: 3% of base pay and 4% match, vests in 3 years
* PTO: unlimited
* Work-life balance: sounds like it's poor based on my interviews
* Work: Rotational program. I will start out working on either a controls/additive manufacturing or computer vision project, and then can rotate to other applications or groups that focus on different technical skills based on my interests. Applications could be anything - robotics, power, renewable energy, healthcare, etc. I'd also get to lead a technical project of my choice during the program.

Thoughts on the work: The ability to rotate through different groups and projects based on my interest is extremely appealing to me. The option to lead a project seems like it would be a great learning experience. Even after the program ends, getting to use one core set of technical skills for projects of different applications sounds very interesting - that's how I'd like to structure my career in an ideal world. I also think I'd get to be working on applications of more interest to me, that seem more relevant to day-to-day society, and that would be transferable to other jobs in the future. 
----------------------
Job 2:

* Highly-regarded non-profit research lab
* Salary: $112k
* Estimate of housing costs (for cost of living comparison): $1900-2000/month in rent, $450k+ houses
* Moving: covered by the company, but may not be grossed up
* Retirement: 2.5% base pay and 8% match, vests after a year
* PTO: 15 days + 7 sick days
* Education benefits: free schooling for up to 24 credits a year with no retention agreement and 200 hours of paid time off for dissertation work (important to me because I LOVE learning and would love to study some science topics I'm personally interested in that I couldn't otherwise afford to study, and I had also been strongly considering an engineering PhD at some point)
* Work-life balance: sounds like they have an unbeatable work-life balance and flexibility
* Work: Military. Could involve signal processing, control, optimization, etc. within a simulation environment

Thoughts on the work: I'm not very interested in doing military work, but the technical skills seem along the lines of my technical interests. A con is that I'm not sure how transferrable my work here would be to other jobs, given that it's a very niche application. I had the option to do biomedical work here instead, which I rejected because it seemed like it would only be data analysis. I may reconsider this though, if they'd still allow me to.

Even though i have great co-workers and the company is good, I simply do not enjoy working in this area, because I am not passionate about learning about the job (outside of work) and the hours seem eternal, life in the assembly factory it's just boring (or maquiladora as we call them in my country).

However, it is my first job and my only source of income, so I need to stay here until I find another position. I am really interested in working outside of my country, and working in countries such as the U.S, China, Australia, Spain, Japan, Korea, and so on.

1170,How is power managed in a microwave oven?,"I'm curious how energy is managed within a microwave. I've been skimming from [this fascinating source](http://www.emu.dk/sites/default/files/physics_of_microwave_oven.pdf), but I don't think it's tailored to my reading level. I especially don't understand, in equation 8 (on the right column of page numbered 78), how to figure the average electric field strength.

Backing up a few steps, my questions are:

1. How much radiative power is reflected by the object being microwaved? If the oven's power rating is held constant, will 100mL of water absorb the same amount of energy in a millisecond as 200mL of water would?
2. The source notes that ice absorbs microwave energy much less than an equivalent mass of water. This matches my anecdotal experience of microwaving frozen things. What happens to the excess energy? Is it wasted?
3. It sounds like a standing wave forms in the microwave cavity. How much energy is stored in this wave, in a typical oven? 
4. In a typical oven, does the microwave emitter have a governor which lowers the power when microwaving a small or negligible quantity of food?
5. How much does geometry of the microwaved object matter? Assuming I have a 12.5cm diameter cylinder of water on a turntable, what happens if I cover the side of the cylinder with microwave-reflective material, leaving the top and bottom disks uncovered?
6. Why is the bottom of my food always cold when the top is piping hot?

Sidenote: how is equation 8 even correct? If I have two equal-sized volumes, with E*_eff_* equaling 1 and 2 V/m, respectively, then the average electric field is 1.5 (times two volumes results in an answer of 3). But if I do the calculation separately then I get 1^2 + 2^2 = 5.

The types of jobs that I mentioned are hard to come by in my country as we don't have a lot of radiology equipment manufacturers here, but if the opportunity does show itself I want to be as prepared for it as possible.

I decided to take some time after work everyday to practice my engineering skills from university as well as learn some ones. The problem is I don't know which direction to take as I'm not sure what skills employers would be looking for in the medical imaging industry. Currently I'm working on developing my PLC programming skills as well as C# machine learning and CAD, but I feel like it would be better to choose one of these and hone in on it rather than getting burned out from trying to learn too much at once.

1184,Trying to spread parts evenly into a cart from an overhead conveyor,"We have an existing process that involves parts being dropped from an overhead conveyor into a cart (about 10' long x 7' wide x 12"" high). The parts don't spread easily, so they pile up at one end of the cart, and an operator has to come up every once in a while and manually spread the parts to the corners of the cart. At the end, the cart is filled about 20"" over the top of the cart towards the middle. The cart is moved with a pulley system and a button throughout the current process, so I think the cart could be set up to move automatically as part of the fix. 

The other part of the problem is that the parts don't get to the corners of the carts unless they're pushed by the operator, so I was thinking about a conveyer that moves left to right as the cart fills. If not the conveyor itself, maybe something at the end of the conveyor to spread them out. 

Any ideas or insight would be appreciated.

1185,"In a theoretical scenario where humanity has colonized planets beyond the stars or even planets in our own solar system, assuming a common government and culture, how would we keep time consistent between them?","I'm not really sure which flair tag I should use here, since there's multiple disciplines that could apply to this question so I hope I'm doing this right. 

As far as the sciences go, this is less of a hard science question than it is a soft science question for the most part (as in, relating to things like anthropology, sociology, etc.), though there's probably a physics application to the question too since we're talking with different frames of reference with regard to time.

Sci-Fi stories with multiple planets still do the ""X years/months/weeks later"" transition, even though planets of different sizes and rotations would have different calendars and would measure time differently. Considering the delivery of things like messages, goods, etc. is important--vital, even--for the functioning of a stable society, and since these things are all dependent on a common understanding of time, how would this actually work when entirely different yearly calendars and day cycles are used?

Like, I can't wrap my mind around it. The closest point of comparison I can think of is the delivery of packages across different time zones here on Earth, which would mean that time zone differences would need to be taken into account, but that's just on a scale of hours and minutes, which are the same for everywhere. When you're talking travel to other planets, which have day/night cycles of varying hours which are different from Earth's 24-hour cycle, to say nothing of the adjustment of their respective calendars which could have more or less months than Earth itself, and that's not even getting into the ***seasons,*** let alone the fact that time would also be measured differently during the trip in space due to relativity.

So how would we keep it consistent? What system would we use? It seems like a small thing, but considering the non-zero possibility of humanity leaving Earth to form permanent settlements elsewhere due to either exploration or lack of resources (assuming the species doesn't eradicate itself first), this strikes me as a pretty huge logistical problem (at least, as long as we're assuming that human society is continuous across the solar and extra-solar colonies--I suppose that if each planet were isolationist and kept to themselves, this would be far less of an issue).

1195,"Relative to the moons in other planetary systems, is our moon really unusually big relative to Earth, and Jupiter/Saturn/etc's moons are normal relative to them, OR, (maybe?) is our moon relatively more normal-proportioned to us, and, say, Jupiter's moons are unusually small for it?","So, if you look at how huge the gas-giant planets are compared to Earth (especially Jupiter and Saturn), and then look at the size of their biggest moons relative to themselves, vs the size of the Moon relative to the Earth, it would seem that the Earth's moon is an unusually large moon, relative to a planet of our size.

So, I always just assumed that it was like, Jupiter, Saturn, etc have normal sized moons relative to themselves, and we (Earth) are the weird one, with an unusually large moon, proportionally speaking.

But, I was thinking about it, and how small of a sample size of planets we have at hand here in our solar system, and, maybe even more importantly, how small of a sample size of planetary systems we have up close and personal that we are inside of (just 1, that is... our own), so, that got me wondering:

Do we know anything about the relative sizes of the moons of the planets of other planetary systems?

Like, could it be that maybe it's the other way around, and it's not us that has the weirdly big moon, and instead, it's that planets as big as Jupiter and Saturn are ""supposed"" to have much larger moons than the ones they have in our Solar System right now?

Or, maybe somewhere in between, like, Earth's still is a little unusually large, but not by as much as one might assume, and, Jupiter/Saturn's moons are a little on the small size, but not to too severe of a degree, or something like that?

Occam's razor figures it to be more likely that we really do just have a weirdly big moon here, orbiting Earth, given even just the medium-low ish sample size of Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune's largest moons vs our moon, to take at hand as what we (up until pretty recently, anyway) had to work with, from a statistical standpoint and just guessing based on that, in and of itself.

So, I figure most *likely* the answer (if there is an answer available as of yet - not sure how good our data is on extra-solar moons so far) is going to be ""nope, ours is indeed strangely large""

But, I figured given the small-ish sample size and dynamics at hand here within our Solar System, there's still enough of a chance that maybe that's not the case, that I should still ask about it, just in case it isn't.

So yea, how much (if anything) do we know about the moons of the planets of other planetary systems, especially in regards to their relative sizes relative to said planets?  I know we can see the wobble-effect the planets have on other stars near us, to guess at the size of the planets orbiting said planet.  But, have we been able to notice anything (at all) in regards to moons?  (I figure it's a longshot, but I might as well ask).

Also, getting away from the empirical side of things, too: what about on the theoretical side of things?

Ask us anything!,"We're Nan Ransohoff and Ryan Orbuch from the Climate team at Stripe. Our work to mitigate the threat of climate change focuses on an underexplored part of the problem-removing carbon from the atmosphere directly, which is essential if the world is to meet its warming targets. Last week, after a rigorous search and review from independent scientific experts, we [announced](https://stripe.com/blog/first-negative-emissions-purchases) Stripe's first purchases from four negative emissions projects with great potential. We hope this will help create a large and competitive market for carbon removal. 

CarbonCure: I'm Rob Niven, Founder and CEO of [CarbonCure Technologies](https://www.carboncure.com/). Our technology chemically repurposes waste CO_2 during the concrete manufacturing process by mineralizing it into calcium carbonate (CaCO_3)-reducing greenhouse gas emissions, lowering material costs, and improving concrete quality. The technology is already being used at 200+ concrete plants from Miami to Singapore to build hundreds of construction projects from highrises to airports.

Charm Industrial: We're Kelly Hering and Shaun Meehan, founding engineers at [Charm Industrial](https://charmindustrial.com/). We have created a novel process for converting waste biomass into bio-oil, which we then inject deep underground as negative emissions-creating a permanent geologic store for carbon. 

Climeworks: I'm Jan Wurzbacher, co-CEO of [Climeworks](https://www.climeworks.com/). We use renewable geothermal energy and waste heat to capture CO_2 directly from the air, concentrate it, and permanently sequester it underground in rock formations. 

Project Vesta: We're Eric Matzner and Tom Green from [Project Vesta](https://projectvesta.org/). Project Vesta captures CO_2 by using an abundant, naturally occurring mineral called olivine. Ocean waves grind down the olivine, which captures atmospheric CO_2 from within the ocean and stabilizes it as limestone on the seafloor.

However for personal reasons I'm not willing to go to school for it.

While I did teach myself most of what I know about programming, I spent about half a year in programming school which , if anything, gave me a sense of direction. Of where to start, and where to go. I started from the very basics ( C ) and then was able to do pretty much anything.

1216,Looking for a thin adhesive with great shear strength,"Plastic impact/slide pucks are pretty popular protection for the action sports I partake in. I recently started adding shock absorbers to the hard plastic pucks of one of my favorite Personal Electric Vehicle protective gear brands of [hand-protection](https://1protect.co/collections/palm-pucks/products/hard-puck-replacement-pack).

I started off using 3M Scotch-Weld DP420 epoxy, but that stuff was a nightmare to use due to the epoxy either spreading too thin while compressing or not thin enough, causing discomfort. It also took days to weeks of curing and spot-fixing.

I pivoted to using 3M VHB 5952(P) and chose the 5952 family due to its broad range of mediums it can utilize, as a lot of these armors use slick plastics. While that has been effective after 1-3 days of curing, the added thickness has not been ideal. It adds several millimeters when applied to the puck and both sides of the shock absorber to hold tight additional hook and loop. It doesn’t sound like much of a thickness difference, but it’s pretty noticeable when you add all the VHB and hook and loop. My beta-testers definitely prefer the pucks made with epoxy due to how much thinner they are, even if the ones using hook and loop are re-usable.

I’ve been considering trying out VHB 5909 for it’s thinner factor, but I do worry about how it’s half as strong on the 90 degree peel adhesion test. The total shear on the [data sheet](https://www.stockwell.com/data-sheets/3m-vhb-tapes.pdf)is at least encouraging.

I’m wondering what you folks think would be a good adhesive to go with given my use-case.

1219,Should I change my Bcom to Engineering as a Mum?,"
I've always loved and been good at maths and science and the idea of building things. Never really went for it as I couldn't get a student loan in Australia at the time and never thought I'd go to uni.
My partner and I both decided that we wanted careers instead of working in hospitality for the rest of our lives. 
I really wanted to do environmental engineering but we decided that if we ever want children I'd most likely be the one dedicating the early years to the kids and it seemed like a lot of money and time taken away from family life. So instead I applied for a Bachelor in Commerce Online, soon after application I fell pregnant. 

Finished first semester full time, dropped second semester and started back up with 3 courses a week this year while being full time mum (no daycare  or any days off from looking after bub). 
It's been very difficult but I've managed to pull B's and A's in coursework/test so far with minimal help. Which gives me confidence that with childcare i could do even more. 

I've recently been debating whether I made the right choice, I love budgeting. Accounting is a solid career without a lot of risk, plus a lot of accountants work from home now, so better family balance. But I hate that it wasn't something I'm passionate about, just good at so should do it for family and better lifestyle. 

Lately I've been really thinking about engineering again and how I think I'm much more interested in it.
I am thinking of changing careers into engineering, I'd like the idea of mechatronics, all areas in mechatronics sounds awesome. 
I also have the option to study both BCom and Bachelor in Engineering as a double degree. With commerce and engineering knowledge I could put those skills into research and development for new products. 

Also just a little side note, my partner dropped uni and is starting a Fly in Fly out job with good income so I wouldn't have to work while I study.
My questions basically are: 

As a Mum, is this something achievable and worthwhile? 

I know this will be possible with hard work, interest and dedication but will the workload put too much pressure in my family life? 

Can I study online from home with just doing work experience instead of lab work at Uni? 

How are the job opportunities for mechatronic engineering in Australia now and foreseeable future? 

Is there a way to get into mechatronics cheaply as a hobby before deciding this pathway?

However I have not yet decided on what I wanna do. I do know that I want 1-2 master degrees and 1-2 bachelor degrees from either mechanical, industrial, or electrical engineering.
So a possible choice could be this: Bachelor of mechanical engineering with specialization in manufacturing + bachelor of industrial and systems engineering + masters of industrial and systems engineering 
Or what about electrical engineering with specialization in robotics?
Or match mechanical and electrical engineering, etc...
I am full of different ideas, but by end of this fall semester I need to make a decision on my major.
I am 99.999% certain I want some kind of degree in industrial and systems engineering, either a bachelor's or masters degree or possibly both. But what goes with industrial and systems engineering? Would it make sense to have a double bachelor's degree in industrial engineering and mechanical? Would it be better to not have a bachelor's in industrial, and just have a masters, and get a bachelor's in either mechanical or electrical?

Some background with mechanical and electrical engineering:
With a mechanical engineering degree I can choose if I want a specialization, such as automotive, energy, manufacturing. Which basically just means that when I take my professional elective courses, they are all in the same category. 
Same concept in electrical engineering except choices are like computer engineering, communications, robotics, electronics, power systems etc... I dont remember all of the choices

So some advice would be helpful if anyone has some work experiences with these fields or experienced the same problem as me years ago",additional engineering degree compliment industrial system engineer branch engineering compliment industrial system engineering degree rd year college student start upcoming winter semester opening enroll professional level course major currently industrial system engineer bse decide want know want    negativenum    master degree    negativenum    bachelor degree mechanical industrial electrical engineering possible choice bachelor mechanical engineering specialization manufacture    bachelor industrial system engineer    master industrial system engineering electrical engineering specialization robotic match mechanical electrical engineering etc different idea end fall semester need decision major    floatnum    percentage    certain want kind degree industrial system engineering bachelor master degree possibly industrial system engineering sense double bachelor degree industrial engineering mechanical bachelor industrial master bachelor mechanical electrical background mechanical electrical engineering mechanical engineering degree choose want specialization automotive energy manufacturing basically mean professional elective course category concept electrical engineering choice like computer engineering communication robotic electronics power system etc remember choice advice helpful work experience field experience problem year ago,0.9995227481464056,0.00047725185359342087,AskEngineers,AskEngineers

So huge that more than 10% of Pacific states' electricity demand could be satisfied by developing a fraction of the wave energy available off the West coast.

Imagine a future where we could harness ALL of our oceans' energy, including energy from moving water, like waves, currents, tides, and offshore winds. Renewable energy like this is not only immense, but its predictable nature allows power grid managers to offset more established, yet variable renewable resources such as wind and solar power. And on a regional scale, widespread marine energy has the potential to provide localized power sources in isolated coastal regions and areas susceptible to extreme events, such as hurricanes, flooding, and storm surge.

But are there environmental costs to widespread installation of marine energy devices in our oceans? How does marine life react to these devices? And is this approach safe?

1250,What kind of tool would you make to distort threads,"Hello,

I was asked to design a special tool for deforming threads. The reason why they want to deform the threads is because they want to lock a threaded stake into a threaded hole and use of thread locking compounds, lock wire etc is not an option. So far they have been using a punch and a hammer to deform the threads in a few spots.

Size of thread is M26x1.5 and there is only about 2mm of extra female thread above the stake, so there isn't really any room to utilise the extra threads for the special tool.

So far I have come up with the following concepts:

* Drill operated bolt cutter type tool that expands two jaws inside the threaded hole and deforms the threads this way. The problem with this concept is that while it may deform the threads around the jaws it probably won't push the thread material down onto the stake in the same way that a hammer and punch would do. This could lead to the stake becoming slightly loose, but it would not back out of the hole.
* Deforming the thread somehow with the help of a hard small ball, like a small tungsten / bearing ball that would ride in the thread valley while being pushed down resulting in the thread peak being pushed down onto the stake. This is probably too complicated and maybe too expensive.
* A custom ""punch and hammer"" type of tool that is inserted into the threaded hole, a hammer is used to hit a bar that is tapered at the other end. Taper end pushes out ""punch bits"" into the thread and deforms it.
* A simple bar with teeth at the other end and is simply hammered into the thread. Something similar was used, but it was discovered that it would cut the material instead of deforming it. 

The material for the female thread is steel.

So, the question is what would you do or design to accomplish this task? The end result will have to be safe and easy to use as it will be used in a factory and not in my garage :-)",kind tool distort thread hello ask design special tool deform thread reason want deform thread want lock thread stake thread hole use thread lock compound lock wire etc option far use punch hammer deform thread spot size thread mx floatnum    mm extra female thread stake room utilise extra thread special tool far come follow concept    drill operate bolt cutter type tool expand jaw inside thread hole deform thread way problem concept deform thread jaw probably push thread material stake way hammer punch lead stake slightly loose hole    deform thread help hard small ball like small tungsten    bear ball ride thread valley push result thread peak push stake probably complicated maybe expensive    custom punch hammer type tool insert thread hole hammer use hit bar taper end taper end push punch bit thread deform    simple bar tooth end simply hammer thread similar use discover cut material instead deform material female thread steel question design accomplish task end result safe easy use use factory garage,0.8284059121520821,0.1715940878479212,AskEngineers,AskEngineers

&gt;You may not use the digital signature option provided in Adobe Acrobat, since it is self-authenticated and does not use a third party. However, you may use Adobe Acrobat in conjunction with the digital signature provided from a proper certification authority.

I'm looking for my first full time position after college. Currently, I have 3 offers, but none that I'm really passionate about. I was supposed to make a decision today regarding the offers, but I was contacted by a recruiter in the morning for a position as a robotics engineer, which is my dream job. Unfortunately the interviews start next week, and I made it clear to them I need a decision from them by Wednesday. When I talked to the employers of my current offers, two of them said they can only postpone the offer to Monday. Right now I'm deciding between risking it and just interviewing for my dream job or just accept one of the offers and be done with it. I might be able to postpone two of them if I beg, but I'm not confident. I spoke to the recruiter and he said that I should call their bluff and let them know I need more time, even going as far as suggesting I give a little white lie about how one of my interviews today had to be delayed to the next week, so I need more time. Regardless I'm not sure what I want to do. I'm young, so I'm sure I can transition to robotics eventually, but I have motivation issues and I would like to work someplace I'm passionate about. I've been unemployed since December, and my money is running out so I need to get a job soon. 

I should also elaborate on my current offers. The first one is the one I dislike the most, but they messaged me they're willing to wait until I interview with the robotics company, so I guess they're my failsafe. The second job is the longest commute (45 mins), but is the largest company with the most stable work environment, so I'll be learning a lot from other people. The final offer is the shortest commute (20 mins), and is vaguely related to robotics, but I will be the only person on the team, so learning is more of a ""sink or swim"" deal, which means it has the most variance in terms of my performance and enjoyability. I might be able to postone this offer, but only to Wednesday at the very latest.

I also realized that the recruiter may not be entirely truthful with me. He said I was the talent, and I had the power in the negotiations, so I should be able to flex it and ask for more time, but that could just be him trying to gas me up so I can consider them more.

The way I see it, if 2nd and 3rd offers don't give me more time, then I can choose to either pick either one of them, or let them expire and roll the dice, but that might end up with me not getting an offer from the robotics company, and being stuck with my first offer, which I like the least.

1267,Flawed science regarding rates of creation/degradation vs concentration measurements?,"Hi, recently I’ve been on a conference and the host said a couple of things that keeps mi mind thinking about it (although he didn’t say any of this explicitly).

If I have two states, A and B (could be hard and soft, juicy and mealy, healthy and disease, whatever) and state B shows a higher amount of a specific transcripts respect to A, then we usually say that this transcript is related to the develop of the phenotype since is statistically higher in condition B. But we actually don’t know if the system in B state is producing more of this transcript leading to a higher concentration of it or if the system isn’t using it. This means that, while the transcript is higher in B it could be because the system isn’t using it because is useless or there’s a problem of other kind. A higher concentration in B doesn’t mean a higher rate of production, thus, the assumption that this specific transcript is important for the phenotype is essentially wrong.

The same logic works for transcripts that shows no difference between these two states. The rate of transcription could be lower in A but the system in A is using and degrading these transcript at the same rate that is being created, while in B the rate of transcription could be way higher than A’s but the rate of degradation is the same too, so we effectively see no difference in concentration but in B this transcript is more important because the rate has increased respect to A.

What does this mean in terms of current scientific investigation? is everything wrong (well, not everything but a part of it) or I am missing a key point here?

PD: I work as a bioinformatician but I’m no fan of reading papers, maybe I’m missing a basic thing?

1276,I need help finding suitable replacement batteries for an APC branded UPS. I am hoping a fellow engineer can help w.r.t the safety of it.,"I've recently got my hands on a second-hand APC branded UPS. The batteries needs replacing and I'm wondering about which batteries to use.

The old batteries consisted of 4 12v 17Ah batteries, with a pair in series (physically bonded with some sort of double-sided tape). Official replacement batteries cost anywhere between R8000 - R10000 \[South African Rand\] ($460 - $580) for the set. I've found that individual 12v 17Ah lead-acid batteries can cost around R800($46) meaning that a set of 4 will be R3600 ($210). \[I am in South Africa\]

However I have seen the cheapest option to be a 12v 18ah gel battery costing R600 ($35) making a set R2400 ($140). Would it be safe to use these batteries in a UPS initially meant for lead acid?

1282,Does lead based paint have anti-mold properties? Google has failed - How do common household molds react to heavy metal exposure?,"I heard a story from an old contractor that I couldn't confirm; Google is no help.

The story goes... lead based paint was great in bathrooms.  When it was banned, then mold started growing in bathrooms and it became a common problem.  When that happened bath fans became mandatory.  With a sudden change in building code many were quick to try to be compliant but it happened that few people understood the air flow rates and science. Worse specifications were rarely enforced at the time of implementation. Ultimately the fan motors proved to be a fired hazard that has claimed countless houses across the US.

Then to bring it full circle, the story teller eventually mentions lead paint was banned because someone drew a correlation with lead exposure inhibiting child development and low inner city test scores. The reasoning was ""test scores must be low because kids are eating paint chips.""

He was much more crude in statement, but insisted the government disregarded, let's call it, ""socio-economic and cultural factors"" - falsely assuming causation where there was correlation and made unnecessary regulation that has cost lives.


Now I can't find much on this. I'd love to debunk it, or see if there's any possible validity to the claim. Any Googling takes me to lead and mold regulations and lawsuits.

For reference, emergency contraception is available without a prescription here in Brazil.

IIRC, the explanation given is that this particular EC ""tricks"" the body - it rapidly increases the progestogen levels that the body normally builds up after ovulation. This causes the endometrium lining of the uterus to thicken and then as the progestogen levels start to decline, the person who took the EC gets their period. They did say that the pre or post fertilization MOA depends on what stage of the menstrual cycle the woman taking it is in.

It's funny that most of the web searches in Portuguese do mention the post-fertilization MOA. Now, when I searched for this in English, most information available (not in official research, more like Your Reproductive System 101) emphasized that this drug *prevents ovulation* and that it absolutely did not work the same as abortion pills.

So...that got me curious, and I wanted to know what's the cause of this divergence in information. Thanks!

1297,What are the reasons to use a solenoid without a fixed core?,"It is known that a solenoid with fixed core would have a exponential-like force profile at the end of the stroke, as the plunger approaches the fixed iron core, thus having relatively high forces. I've however run across some linear solenoids that completely omit a fixed core, in which the plunger can slide all the way inside the bobbin, having no mechanical stop, from my observation, I can see some pros on that, like being silent (no clicking at the end of the stroke)and no residual magnetism when the coil is off, but the con would be that the forces would be considerably lower when compared to another that has a fixed core, and a more flatenned force profile, quasi-linear. My question is: what would be the main reason for that, would that be for a more linear, hence more controllable force output? Or is there something else that I'm missing?

Those solenoids I mentioned are custom made ones, from diverse manufacturers, the application consists of having a solenoid being PWM'ed through a range of different currents to achieve different forces, from very soft to hard strikes (usually overvoltaged).

For reference, I'm adding here a website from a manufacturer that do provide one of those ""silent"" solenoids, although I couldn't really find the schematics for it.

however, we dont know which light is the culprit.

so, i made a tall wooden box (20cmx20cm) that is the full height of the pool. it is a 3 sided box (one side is open) that has the open side forced over a light and sealed. i filled the pool with water,and the box with water, both the same level. just above the lights.  

on the first light, the water sill leaked out. now the box is over the second light, filled with water, and there is no leak.

i hypothesise that this light is the culprit, because even though it is under water, it is not leaking. and i ""think"" that the small size of the box has reduced the pressure on the hole compared to a full swimming pool, even though the level is the same.

my friend reckons the horizontal water force inside the small box would be the same as the horizontal force inside the large pool. however i think the force in the box is less, hence why the light doesnt leak now.

Further, we are the only ones we know of who now provide Advanced Transient Suppression Technology (ATST) in our mind control and electronic attack countermeasure devices. All electronic devices can be damaged or destroyed by common high-voltage transients from lightning and defective high-voltage equipment and power lines, electrical arcs and coronas, inductive kicks from high-voltage power interruptions, and static electric discharges. Also, based on what we know, mind control and electronic attack predators are increasingly resorting to directional high-pulse burst transmitters (pulse-type directed energy transmitters), possibly even EMP, to wipeout costly countermeasure devices deployed by mind control and electronic attack victims to protect themselves. Our unique countermeasure devices now come with our ATST protection against up to 1,500 watts of burst energy attack power (at no extra cost) to foil even the most highly dedicated wipeout attack tactics, as well as to help protect you from common forms of high-voltage transients.

Thanks for having me here. I'll be here from 12pm to 3pm PT today (3-6 PM ET, 19-22 UT). My latest research on bullying (with coauthors Diane Felmlee and Cassie McMillan) was based on the idea that teens use aggression to gain social status in their school and tried to identify the most likely targets for their cruelty. To the extent that bullying is used this way, adolescents are likely to target their own friends and friends-of-friends, for these are their rivals for desired social positions and relationships.

We indeed found that, compared to schoolmates who are not friends, friends are four times as likely to bully each other, and friends-of-friends are more than twice as likely to do so. Additionally, ""structurally equivalent"" classmates - those who are not necessarily friends, but who share many friends in common - are more likely to bully or otherwise victimize each other.

1317,Can someone explain the reasons for why the big crunch theory is not considered the most likely scenario for how the universe will end?,"To clarify:  
  
1) Just because we can **currently** observe the universe accellerating does in no way, shape or form mean it will do so forever?     

  
As a metaphor. If I throw a ball really hard, then it will accellerate at an increasing rate before slowing down, stopping, or bouncing back. I don't understand how we being able to observe the universe expanding now, no matter how rapidly, is evidence that it will never slow down, halt, or rebound. Considering a cosmic timeframe, our observation of the motion of the universe would be insignificantly small compared to the full motion in question.  
  
2) Wouldn't our very existence be proof of the big freeze being wrong? By that I mean: If the universe could end / was finite. Then the odds of us existing would be non-existent?   
  
  
Scenario A) The universe is finite  
Scenario B) The universe is infinite  
  
Scenario B is likely, because we exist.  
And scenario A is almost infinitely unlikely, because if life could only exist a finite amount of times, then the chance of us existing in a set number in a finite chain would be immeasurably low? When talking statistics, then we existing in universe 1/1, 4/5 or 55/84 or 999/999 is actually so unlikely that it borders to impossible? This because whatever follows a set number would be infinity. In other words, in an infinite timespan us existing in a finite universe would be an impossibility?  
  
3) The big crunch is the theory that best explains the nature of existence? If the universe has a mechanism that causes it to explode/implode infinitely, then it fits the law of conservation of energy perfectly, as well as explaining how probable it is that we exist in the first place?

1328,Gearing of reaction wheel,"I'm currently in the progress of creating a reaction wheel to balance an inverse pendulum. I have tried to go from 1:1 to 10:1 gearing, and it seems that it makes relatively much more torque, but over a shorter period. And this is what my electro-engineer-teacher believes (I'm a mechanical student).

I can't seem to make up the math. I have found this equation.

T\_engine=alpha\_engine\*(I\_reactionwheel/GearRatio\^2)

To me, this shows that the gear ratio is somewhat irrelevant, as long as the inertia is corrected.

My explanation:

As for the perfect engine, the torque should be constant, so double gear-ration means 4 times bigger inertia, to get the same angular acceleration. In practice, the engine should have some ideal range where it performs the best. As too big inertia would make the engine unable to rotate the reaction wheel. At the other end of the range, the inertia would be so small, that the engine won't generate any torque.

Therefore the only explanation I can come up with is that the inertia of the reaction wheel was too big for the 1:1 gearing and therefore wasn't in its best range of performance.

1331,Questions about Plastic Design for Injection Molding," Hello Everyone,

I Have a masters in Electromechanical Engineering and I am working in a company that designs Plastic Parts for payment terminals. When I was first assigned to modify an existing part, I had no idea why those DRAFT angles, Ribs, Screw bosses are even there and I was only caring about the functionality .... When My boss and I had a review on my project, he was shocked that I don't know much about Tolerancing, Injection Molding Design Guidelines and GD&amp;T. It felt very bad as If not a proper Engineer in his eyes. So I Started reading some books and seeing some Designs and Now I'm finally starting to get it.

However, I can't help but to feel like a ROOKIE, and Always in need of an experienced eyes to guide me and correct my mistakes.

I would like to ask a couple of questions , lets start with Fillets.

**Should we use Fillets on Every possible Edge as fillets reduce stress concentration in sharp corners and enhance Flow ? what is the mindset to know if I should place a Fillet or not (Specially on Ribs and Screw bosses) ?**

1332,Just enrolled in college at 22 (4 years since I graduated) and I'm going for eet currently. anyone willing to give me some insight on the following?,"So I've wanted to be a mechanical engineer since I was 6 years old. Rough life with foster care and what not but I've always been a nerd. (If I wasn't the same as everyone else... aka poor I'd go for a PhD in mechanical and electrical engineering theoretically) even in highschool I thought different. Physics was my favorite class aside from chorus in ninth grade. (I still remember class ending and me going to the teacher and proposing ideas that were told was wrong still a possibility in my mind though a few differences for sure in theory.) well I graduated in 2018. I didn't go straight to work. I had 2  years of helping my gramps who sadly passed last year right after I switched from working at a grocery store to working at a automotive manufacturing plant. 

I like my job I have now though not really. I don't like repetitive stuff. I do but I like thinking. Even now I constantly can't help but spend my time every other day contemplating my own theoretical solutions. (And recently delving into a theory into completing unified field theory) I'm tired of the monotony and I'm tired of knowing I'm wasting my potential. I'm a knowledge sponge I can take concepts and info from dozens of locations over time and compile them to fact check and etc. In the words of many people: ""i overthink shit"" there's no question engineering and or science is right for me. 

Anyway I went to take my entrance test for my community college and I've discovered a problem... I forgot math. Like not that bad but bassically I'm having to retake algebra 1 and whatnot. I could study and take the placement test again before class begins, but I know when I took that test that my math knowledge had degraded enough. retaking the entrance test and trying to place in higher classes is a very poor decision. I should say... it's not that I don't like math. I do. In fact again back to the nerd part. I litterally often pull up and start randomly multiplying and calculating nonsense related to how many cars we've got left to build and etc. And even now I know that in order to complete my theory (which is just really completing Einsteins theory lol) I need math to do so. Like I said I'm great at taking general concepts and studying and studying going deeper into it. I've come to on my own time realize that engineering and science is seemingly 60-80% research and 40-20% design. It makes it fun though as wierd as that sounds.

I had a rough childhood with foster care and many other factors. I didn't pay attention in highschool. Ashd and deppression amongst other things didnt help neither. In highschool I didn't take anything other than algebra 1, 2, and geometry (and I got my fourth math credit in 9th by taking pre-algebra) I was good enough in middle school my teacher recommended me for algebra 2 though but I failed first year of ninth grade and recovered but they set me back into pre-algebra. 

Anyway I know engineering is heavy on calculus. And I don't have the funds to do mechanical or electrical engineering. (It's why for now I'm going eet with the pursuit of field engineer but am considering the 60-100k in debt that comes with maybe switching my major after one year to bachelor of science and transferring to my state university for electrical engineering) I know that engineering has one of the highest drop out rates... how screwed do you think I am? I'm a stubborn persistent person. (Ps I love theoretics and wouldn't mind discussing in dms if ya want lol) but I'm hoping someone here can give me insight into whether it may be worth going ahead and choosing electrical engineering and 100k of debt rather than waste a year and 6 grand on exploration and self observation in regards to math potential. 

(Also as to why I chose EET instead of MET... I like both but eet is the one offered by my local community college and In order to prove my theory it goes more into Electrical engineering rather than mechanical. I like both. Electrical being more the soul and mechanical being more the body. Besides, if eet goes as I hope I'll go back in a few years for met just for personal gratification so I can delve deeper still. Also I don't care about the pay difference between either honestly. I hate the conceptual idea of money. Both make good pay. And at the end of the day it's a means to an end and possibly just a means for completing my own projects. So don't both going off pay in your advice unless it's worth noting from your own experience in heavy debt and paying it off lol)

Sorry for the long post but it's hard to discuss the question without context. Besides I consider engineers my peers degree or not. You don't spend 5 hours on an assembly line contemplating alternative energies, unified field theory, and quantum mechanics with my lifelong dream and lose that mental kinship. The degree doesn't make the scientist. The scientist and his pursuit of knowledge(science) does. 


Summary: How likely am I to do ok with engineering mathematics given I never took calculus in highschool? Is it worth just doing my current plan and wasting the first year in Electrical engineering technologies and testing my math dedication or should I take a leap of faith and just switch to pure electrical engineering or not?

1344,How does the human body sense humidity?,"My question arises from the discussion about what is a better measure of how humid or ""sticky"" it feels outside - there are a lot of sources that claim the dew point is a much better measure of humidity than relative humidity.

I don't understand the reasoning there . I do understand the whole relationship about hotter air being able to hold more water, but in my understanding, our bodies sense humidity by sensing the rate of evaporation of our sweat. If the produced sweat cannot evaporate, the air feels hotter and ""stickier"". The evaporation rate of sweat however is mostly dependent on the saturation of the surrounding air with water vapor, and the saturation is measured by relative humidity, not absolute humidity.

To illustrate my point: For a fixed water vapor content of (10g water/1qm air), the higher the temperature, the lower saturation level (relative humidity), and the higher the rate of evaporation. Plus, the higher temperatures are going to give more kinetic energy to the water molecules in my sweat, further increasing the rate of evaporation.

So it makes no sense to me to say that a dew point of 16 degrees Celsius is usually what people regard as ""sticky"", because it cannot tell me anything about the expected rate of evaporation of my sweat. Thus, I came to the conclusion that my understanding that we perceive humidity by the rate of evaporation must be flawed, and this yields my question.",human body sense humidity question arise discussion measure humid sticky feel outside    lot source claim dew point measure humidity relative humidity understand reasoning    understand relationship hot air able hold water understanding body sense humidity sense rate evaporation sweat produce sweat evaporate air feel hot stickier evaporation rate sweat dependent saturation surround air water vapor saturation measure relative humidity absolute humidity illustrate point fix water vapor content g waterqm air high temperature low saturation level relative humidity high rate evaporation plus high temperature kinetic energy water molecule sweat far increase rate evaporation sense dew point    degree celsius usually people regard sticky tell expect rate evaporation sweat come conclusion understanding perceive humidity rate evaporation flawed yield question,0.04998115399333117,0.9500188460066658,AskScience,AskScience
1345,What skills should I be trying to pick up to transition to a job in RF/EM?,"Hello everybody. I’m looking to make a transition from the power industry into an RF/antenna engineering role. Some background on me:

I graduated with a BS in EE in 2020, “specializing” in E&amp;M. I use quotations because we only get to choose our EE electives in our senior year and it was only four classes. I chose classes on computational electromagnetics, electromagnetic interference, and antenna design. 

Upon graduation however, I was given a job with a power company that I had been interning with since 2018. The role that I have, which is basically just a full time version of what I was doing as an intern, is more data analysis than it is engineering. Data analysis is even a loose term since I don’t do any fancy work with Python or R or anything like that. I write a bunch of queries, make dashboards with PowerBI, and make nice Excel tools.

The skills I’ve picked up while working at my current job have mainly been SQL and VBA knowledge, as well as just getting all around better at Excel. This is all great, but I really want to move into a career more suited to my “specialization” in undergrad.

I started my masters this semester, actually focusing on E&amp;M and signal processing. I think I would like to become an antenna design engineer. I was wondering what skills you thought would be useful for me to pick up while I’m getting my MS so I can be more appealing when applying for jobs in those fields.

1347,Draining my shallow-flooded roof.,"I want to drain the roof and have a system of using a flexible plastic tube attached to weight (not shown).

I want to drain the roof and have a system of using a flexible plastic tube attached to weight (not shown). I fill the tube with water from the faucet, trap one end with my finger, place the other end in standing water. I then place the end with my finger into the lower gutter channel, release and hopefully watch the syphon vacuum suck out the air and begin to drain the swamp™.

This work mostly on the first try, but there’s some problem with the design.

\*Blockages – the asphalt has tiny stones embedded that shed and eventually clog the tube. Leaves and other bio garbage combine with the stones to form clogs. The flow can lift the stones, but often a barrier is formed at the inlet.

\*Starting – I need to step in the puddle (usually in the rain) to place primed syphon. If it gets blocked and it’s still raining, I need to climb in again to move or clear it. It’s easy to break the seal since it’s sitting in such swallow water.

How do I drain my roof automatically? I’ve considered a small solar panel and pump, but then it needs a rain sensor. Hydrodynamics must have an answer I feel. I would love to hear your ideas.

1358,"When calculating gravity, shouldn’t we also include the volume of an object because of the various contributing vectors?","We always treat gravity (From the Earth) as a force pulling us straight down, but isn’t that just an average of the contributing vectors?

For example, If I were standing at the North Pole, the large masses of earth underneath Africa, north America, and Australia are all exerting a force on my body, but all at different angles—It’s only the accumulated force of all the particles of the earth pulling at me that average out to be straight down right? Since gravity is a vector, don’t different particles at different points on the Earth, “Cancel out” some of the effects of the others?

So my question is—when calculating the pull of gravity precisely, wouldn’t one need the variables of mass, distance *and* the shape and volume of the object to get accurate results? I guess if you’re doing math for gravity, the object will probably be spherical, but wouldn’t a single point with the same mass as the Earth at x distance from an object have a more *direct* pull of gravity than the Earth itself at x distance and thus a greater magnitude? If the Earth instantly compressed down to a single point at the center of it’s core, would it accelerate me more than 9.8 m/s^2 towards it?

(I realize all the mass between me and the core would be that much further away, and thus have less influence, but all the mass on the far side of the earth would be that much closer as well, I’m just wondering how much focusing gravity would increase it).
	
This is just a curiosity question that I couldn’t find any information on. I’m not that good at math, but is there any source that talks about calculating for this?

Thank you.

Obviously, any split between the brain and body is spurious, but I feel more prepared to fight the good fight against my most dangerous cravings now than I ever have before, and I'm curious as to what is happening to make me feel this way (and what I can do to increase that will power, if possible).

1380,"AskScience AMA Series: We're Nick Magliocca and Kendra McSweeney and our computer model shows how the War on Drugs spreads and strengthens drug trafficking networks in Central America, Ask Us Anything!","Our findings published on April 1, 2019, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences demonstrate that cocaine trafficking, or 'narco-trafficking, through Central America to the United States is as widespread and difficult to eradicate as it is *because* of interdiction, and increased interdiction will continue to spread narco-traffickers to new areas in their pursuit of moving drugs north.

We developed a simulation model, called NarcoLogic, that found the result of the 'cat-and-mouse' game of narco-trafficking and counterdrug interdiction strategies is a larger geographic area for trafficking with little success in stopping the drug from reaching the United States. In reality, narco-traffickers respond to interdiction by adpating their routes and modes of transit, adjusting their networks to exploit new locations. The space drug traffickers use, known as the 'transit zone', has spread from roughly 2 million square miles in 1996 to 7 million square miles in 2017. As a result, efforts by the United States to curtail illegal narcotics from getting into the country by smuggling routes through Central America over the past decades have been costly and ineffective.

The model provides a unique virtual laboratory for exploring alternative interdiction strategies and scenarios to understand the unintended consequences over space and time.

Our paper describes the model, its performance against historically observed data, and important implications for U.S. drug policy: [https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/03/26/1812459116](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/03/26/1812459116).

1384,How do spacelike separated measurements of entangled particles work?,"I recently got into a lengthy discussion on reddit about measuring an entangled pair. Say Alice and Bob each have half of an entangled pair of particles. Alice and Bob then each measure the spin of their particles (such that the measurement events are spacelike separated) and record the results.

We both agreed that entanglement cannot be used to send classical information faster-than-light. However, the contention of the other redditor seemed to be that when Alice, say, measures her pair and sees spin up, the state knows it has been measured, and then Bob's measurement is determined to be spin down.

My contention was that this idea is in conflict with relativity: if the measurements are made with spacelike separation, there are frames in which Alice measures first, and frames where Bob measures first, each equally valid. If the information of just when the state collapsed is carried in the state ""at the instant of measurement,"" even if it's not accessible to an observer, there's a problem, because whose frame determines when the state was actually measured? All we can say for sure is that the results of Alice and Bob's measurements will be correlated. 

I have a physics education, but I've never learned entanglement formally, so I was hoping someone with more expertise than myself could clear this up.",spacelike separate measurement entangled particle work recently lengthy discussion reddit measure entangled pair alice bob half entangled pair particle alice bob measure spin particle measurement event spacelike separate record result agree entanglement use send classical information fasterthanlight contention redditor alice measure pair spin state know measure bob measurement determined spin contention idea conflict relativity measurement spacelike separation frame alice measure frame bob measure equally valid information state collapse carry state instant measurement accessible observer problem frame determine state actually measure sure result alice bob measurement correlate physics education learn entanglement formally hope expertise clear,0.0912791388439152,0.9087208611560851,AskScience,AskScience

The thing that surprised me in school was that I actually kind of enjoyed the math classes required for architecture. (Calc especially) And I was better at it than I thought I'd be. Not great, (everyone knows architects don't really use it in practice so my motivation was a bit meh) but it cured me of my mathphobia at least.

How do I proceed with finding someone or some company to help with this? I'm a software engineer by trade so I'm clueless about where to begin or what this type of work is even called. I'm willing to invest $10K-50K into this but have no idea what to expect it should cost or what different solutions exist.

1409,Mechanism of Renal Toxicity of Thiobutabarbital?, Thiobutabarbital was withdrawn from the German market in 1993 due to renal toxicity. I am trying to find the mechanism of renal toxicity of thiobutabarbital but i am struggling to do so. The only thing I have been able to find is a study in which thiobutabarbital-anaesthetised rats experienced significant diuresis which could be related to direct inhibition of ADH-dependent and/or independent renal fluid reabsorption. Same article says that thiobutabarbital inhibited proximal tubular reabsorption of Na+ in rats.

1412,"On a phase diagram, is there vapor pressure at pressures and temperatures not on the coexistence curve?","On a [phase diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram#/media/File:Phase-diag2.svg), I've learned that the coexistence curve at a phase boundary is where the chemical potential of the two phases are equal. This leads to the Clausius-Clayperon equation, which can be used to estimate vapor pressure at various temperatures.

But say I was on the coexistence curve between liquid and vapor, and I increased the pressure (or decreased the temperature). I should now be solidly in the liquid region of the phase diagram, where the chemical potential of the liquid phase is lowest. Does that mean liquid is the only phase present? I've been told that vapor pressure exists for any liquid under any conditions.

If there is vapor pressure despite the higher pressure, then aren't the two phases coexisting? Then why is the phase boundary called the ""coexistence curve""?

1415,"I transferred to a new team at work, and went from being an underperformer to being recommended for a promotion within a month. How do you tell if your performance review is accurate, or if there are politics involved?","I really don't want to be that person who does a bad job, and isn't mature enough to admit they were at fault. However, I strongly suspect that my previous poor performance reviews were political.

While I worked for my old team, I was constantly being told I was incompetent and didn't have good engineering skills by my old boss. A coworker on my team actually told me I should reconsider this career and I wasn't fit to be an engineer, and he strongly believed my then supervisor should have fired me, and couldn't understand how I got passes on performance reviews (got bad reviews but not enough to be disciplined). My old team was working on one of the less important projects at the company, so it wasn't exactly a tough team, which made me feel even worse about myself. 

When I was re-orged into a new team (which had tougher expectations, and higher hiring standards) my new boss told me I was performing at the next level and started giving me big projects. I thought he might have just liked me a lot, as we got along really well. But I found out it wasn't just him. I got peer feedback from three of my coworkers, who were veterans at the company and very well respected, said I learned really quickly and onboarded unusually fast, and had really high output. They told me they were very worried about me at first due to my old boss's complaining about how shitty at my job I was, and they were blown away by how good I was.

So, I did not change anything about myself or my work habits (and realistically, it's not like you can change that much in a single month!). My old job and new job are very similar, so there wasn't a ""role fit"" issue, or a technical background issue. The people on my new team are, on average, higher performers than the people on my old team.

1443,Why do quantities like brain-structure-mass-to-neuron ratio affect animal cognition?,"Hi AskScience,

I've been reading about Dr. Herculano-Houzel's [brain soup](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2014.00077/full) method after following some popular science articles. It appears that in various brain structures, the mass-to-neuron ratio for primates deviates from other groups of mammals and presumably that is at least one factor which causes increased cognition (though I could be wrong, so please let me know if so!). Why should that be the case?

As a side question, have any studies been done on other mammals such as whales and dolphins? A quick google search didn't yield anything in that realm.

Thanks!

The concept being that as a new particle position is calculated, instead of calculating the strength of each 3 forces seperately, just do it all in one shot. When the function returns a positive value from the green region, they are attracting based on the effect of gravity - green region. When there is enough force to push them past the negative function return - red region - they will be bound together.

The coulomb barrier would represent the magnitude of the red region, binding force in the blue region, etc... The specifics of the function in terms of distance ranges and magnitudes can be put in for accuracy.

The total enclosure boundary is 170 meters with 80 meters (262 ft) of fencing needed and the rest being a natural dirt wall.

As of now we are considering three main concepts:

1. Reinforced concrete columns with wire/rope in between
2. Reused railway tracks as poles and crossbars
3. Large wooden logs positioned with gaps smaller than the elephants width

The fencing has to be strong enough for the elephants to scratch/lean, but also be as low cost as possible, as the prices in Sri Lanka are at their highest due to the ongoing economic crisis.

We are having a hard time determining the sufficient dimensions for all of the concepts.

1475,Is it a good idea to do materials science and engineering and physics double degree?,"I'm a grade 12 student right now and I recently got accepted to University. I am quite interested in electronic materials(semiconductors). So, I was thinking to do materials science and engineering and physics double degree which is going to take 5 years to graduate. The reason why I choose a double degree is I think physics degree will give me more depth about electronic materials. Because in physics I can learn more about solid-state physics and condensed matter physics which will give me more background to understand semiconductors. But I'm not sure doing a double degree is a good idea. Instead of doing a double degree should I just get a Master's in materials engineering after finishing a single degree?

Some notes:

I will use a PD controller that will receive an external sensor input to generate a target, I am not sure if I will use a simple proximity sensor, or a more complicated sensor that looks for certain signals (the colour red for example). The error in the PD controller will be controlled by a rotary encoder.

For my first step of the project I have to size a motor I have made an attempt I am not sure if I have done it right. Would it be okay if reddit could critique my design methodology?

To size the motor first I determined an RPM by simply moving around the dummy (I have one in real life), for a minute to determine what is a reasonable RPM that is required for this application, in this case I found it to be about 40, as in I was able to circle around the dummy at distance a user would be 40 times in one minute.

Then I found the moment of mass inertia by downloading a 3d model and approximating bob as a rectangle, rotating about a central axis. I calculated a value of 0.262 kg\*m2. I used the equation below.

[https://www.google.com/search?q=mass+moment+of+inertia+of+rectangle+block&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB\_enCA979CA979&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsaf5i5PG869\_CkRPCj74mVVQyrh5A:1653311207342&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwia0N2Z2PX3AhWGRs0KHQPfBMIQ\_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=625&amp;dpr=1.5#imgrc=VSM97UI2FMI\_OM](https://www.google.com/search?q=mass+moment+of+inertia+of+rectangle+block&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enCA979CA979&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsaf5i5PG869_CkRPCj74mVVQyrh5A:1653311207342&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwia0N2Z2PX3AhWGRs0KHQPfBMIQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=625&amp;dpr=1.5#imgrc=VSM97UI2FMI_OM)

I chose a design angular acceleration of 4.2 rad/s\^2, in one second bob will accelerate to his maximum required of 40 rpm = 4.2 rad/s.

From this information I calculated the maximum torque required for this application from the relation T = angular accel\* Mass moment of area = .262\*4.2 rad/s\^2.

**I get a motor that is required to produce 11.5 lb -in of torque, and 40 rpm.**

Does my math make sense, am I close to what is required to size a motor. I did some research on motor sizing and I came across a lot of information including something called the motor inertia to object inertia ratio I didn't factor that into my design.

Are my numbers realistic, if I am totally off the mark what are some good resources I can access for motor sizing?

Lastly what kind of price range would I need for a motor to do this application?

The other way she mentioned was that you add boron to silicon and that works in some way( didn't quite understand what she told; but something to do with silicon having more electrons).

 which would technically be better for doping- arsenic or boron? or is there something better than both?

However, it seems to me that amps are a weird choice for the SI unit for electricity. current is the measure of how much charge passes in a certain time Seeing as charge is a property of fundamental particles it makes more sense to have coulombs as an SI unit and have amps defined as coulombs per seconds rather than the other way around. 

Comparably, I think having amps as an SI unit is like having velocity as an SI unit and length being defined as velocity x time. 

On my own research there's alot about how amps is defined but not much as to why it was chosen as an SI unit. I thought it could have something to do with the development of electricity but can't seem to find much on that. Can anyone help?

1520,"Graduating in mechanical engineering, discovered that I am not hands on or mechanically inclined at all","I graduated in December 2020 with a bachelors in mechanical. Prior to that I was studying physics and I dropped out of it because I did not believe in myself. I decided on mechanical because it was STEM and because I could graduate on time due to the overlap in classes. I took summer classes every summer so that I could graduate on time. 

I ended up graduating with no experience (internship canceled due to COVID), and luckily I managed to end up as a manufacturing engineer in a large multinational in early 2021. Well, let's just say I SUCK at it. It's been a year and I can barely turn a wrench. I even had trouble reading engineering drawings at first and also I find that I have trouble visualizing mechanical assemblies in my head. I am amazed when some technician starts talking about a machine or how something would/wouldn't work with just their mind. I was thinking about dropping out of engineering altogether but I decided to stick it out. Now I'm in my second year of the job and my role has more or less transitioned into a project manager kind of thing. 

However, I get super bored filling out excel sheets or doing mindless work, so I need a middle point in engagement between ""braindead"" and using my hands as the primary function of my job. There's days where I do nothing or very little. There's a couple times I really clutched and got some do or die projects done, but for the most part I would say that I am not really a ""manufacturing engineer"". All the technicians make fun of the engineers because they do most of the work.

I started getting into coding just to try and see if I would be good at it, and I am enjoying it. I was afraid of touching it for like 4 years because I failed my freshman level intro to programming class. I think that's a possible career. There are lots of things about electrical engineering that interest me as well. So let me make a list of my strengths/weaknesses and interests and I would love to get some input into some engineering paths I could be successful at. By the way, I've had 3 managers and I made clear to all 3 that this was probably not my best fit position and they all were cool with that, they always told me that finding your stride takes a while.

**Strengths**

* Highly analytical, can spend hour reading texts which other people would have a hard time
* Very persistent and learns new stuff day in and day out both in work and outside of it
* Good interpersonal skills and can easily mingle with blue and white collars workers seamlessly
* Able to break down projects and dive into them, can explain everything with ease to anyone, which I think is great because I notice that engineers tend to be very poor communicators

**Weaknesses**

* Poor organization (this needs to be corrected for any job either way)
* Poor dexterity
* Hard time imagining physical systems working, or finding improvements on a machine
* Can suffer hard impostor syndrome at times

**Favorite classes in college**

* Fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, heat transfer
* Electricity and magnetism, physics
* Accounting elective, economics

1535,A Brief History of Human Body Hair?,"This is a question specifically about the genetics of body hair growth, as opposed to grooming or fashion.

If we look back far enough, towards our ape-like ancestors, it's often assumed that pre-species humans had a shaggy coat of body hair. This would have served a functional purpose, like with most mammals, of regulating body temperature.

My question is this: At what point in human evolution did we stop being smothered head-to-toe in follicles, and start resembling the mostly smooth-skinned mammals we are today?

Additionally: Was there a triggering event (such as an ice age / the wearing of furs) and is there a continued trend that humans are becoming increasingly hairless?",brief history human body hair question specifically genetic body hair growth oppose grooming fashion look far apelike ancestor assume prespecie human shaggy coat body hair serve functional purpose like mammal regulate body temperature question point human evolution stop smother headtotoe follicle start resemble smoothskinned mammal today additionally trigger event ice age    wearing fur continued trend human increasingly hairless,0.0048755597714547775,0.9951244402285445,AskScience,AskScience

So far I have come up with this:

Torque input = moment of inertia\*rate of change of angular speed + Force due to drag\*radius of blade

so: T= I\*wdot + Kw\^2

where K = 0.5\*pi\*rho\*Cd\*r\^5

The problem arises when taking the Laplace of the equation. I cant seem to do it as the function w is squared. How can I get around this problem?

1558,Is my job ACTUAL Mechanical Engineering?,"So at the moment, I work a job at a factory with the mechanical engineering title. I don't want to sound fancy with what I do as to me it does not seem fancy, but basically I just try and find solutions to the numerous problems that arise as this company tries to produce products. I work with a team of mechanical engineers and honestly it kind of feels like we are a bunch of students always working on a never ending group project. My boss explained to me that the goal is to increase production but still maintain high quality products. Anything I can solve or help with to push that goal is what I do. There was a fancy list of things that I would be doing on the job application, but I honestly can't remember exactly what was on there and if I am even doing them. I remember reading it and being overwhelmed, but I still applied anyways.

But everyday since I've been working at this factory, I have a lot of options to do stuff almost at my own discretion. My boss will stop by from time to time to get updates but it's almost up to us how we do things. Sometimes, machines are breaking and I'm running around fixing them. Other times I'm combining excel sheets of data and then interpreting what they mean and who's screwing up and needs to be retrained. Parts of my day include monitoring production lines and verifying that operators are following procedures. If they don't or are not listening to their line leads, I write them up which could lead to being fired if they get enough. I also write and rewrite procedures depending on new ideas and products introduced. In conclusion, there are a lot of variety of tasks and chores to cover to support production but I also get the freedom to try and look for production problems and find ways to solve them. So I constantly have side projects that I try to see through and constantly communicating back with the team to make sure we are on the same page and bounce ideas as well.

Truth is, I actually really like this job. Their is just so much variety and freedom and that's just the tip of the list. But what I want to know, is **if this is actually considered a real mechanical engineering job?** And *if not*, **does a job like this exist where you can make close to 80k/year starting salary?** **Does it possess another title?**

I also ask these questions because currently the job does not pay very well. As a mechanical engineer for this factory, I make about $27/hr (really $24/hr after taxes) and no benefits what so ever. (I'm located in USA California by the way), so a wage like this ain't going to help me raise a family if I ever start one and I swear they said I was suppose to be living a comfortable life being a mechanical engineer and all. I'm going to stick with this job to gain some work experience and help grow myself, but it would really help if I had an idea of where to head next when I'm finally ready.

I’ve been pulled into a handful of projects and tasks beyond my main responsibilities, which I’ve actually enjoyed because it’s gotten some praise and I think I’ve been doing well.

But recently I made my first (decent size) fuckup. Basically there was a batch that tested out-of-control, so the manufacturing engineer asked me (quality) if it’s good to release anyway given customer agreements. I only checked 1 set of customer spec limits without checking another set, so now 3 weeks later there’s a small fire because the customer received an OOC batch. Turns out it was just test noise and it retested in-control, but it’ll still likely be a complaint issued by a tier-one customer. It’s slightly on manufacturing too, because we should’ve held a formal review for the material instead of asking me offline. But it’s mainly my mistake. I think I handled it pretty well and got some additional training so I feel confident I won’t do it again

&amp;#x200B;

I have read somewhere that in video gaming, playing in higher resolution lessens the strain on the CPU, because the GPU gets busier. So for instance, if you have a very good graphics card, but an ancient CPU, it makes more sense to game in 3840x2160p rather than 1920x1080p.

&amp;#x200B;

Is that right? If so, why? Why would a higher resolution take away strain frim the CPU? I understand the graphics card gets busier, but why would that make it easier for the CPU?

Do you think we're just heating the sand with electricity using resistant coils? Can the sand receive heat generated that way quickly enough or do we need a heat exchanger architecture, like a radiator but for sand? My understanding is that heat is hard to transfer long range. Do we ultimately go with a system where there's a sand battery in every neighbourhood which heats homes and water there? Or is this something where it makes sense to convert that heat energy back into electricity when we need to transfer it long range? Does a traditional battery just make more sense in that case?

1580,I need help coming up with ideas on fixing a problem created between operations and engineering (prior to me joining the company),"I'm a Product Quality Engineer. Product Engineer in terms of like SME on my product line (so I consult on some of the projects going on) and Quality Engineer for everything else (CAPAs, field complaints, production quality, etc.).

Here is some background:

There were two projects, launched more or less back to back between 2016 and 2018. I'll call Project A the one around 2016 and Project B the one around 2018. The projects overlap on a material for Component 1, but there's 8 different configurations, 4 for Project A and 4 for Project B. The 4 from Project A were derivatives from designs originally from the 1960s (literally the same dimensions, just a different material) and the 4 from Project B are brand new dimensions. These projects were design/developed by the development engineers (DEs from now on). VPE is VP of Engineering and VPO for VP of Ops.

The problem:

Project A was launched *without* components being inspected for conformance to specifications, which is a required part to completing any project. Essentially, they (DEs) accepted the components in and made notes about sorting them for production and working with the supplier to correct the issue for future orders. Come in with Project B, and they essentially did the same thing again. When looking for project files for either of these projects, there are missing files, specifically around testing. 

Now, for Project A, there have been a lot of complaints around Component 1; this has also been an issue in production as we have had nothing but nonconforming product received in...since 2016. At some point or another it became an issue for Quality to handle? Project A.1 was created to try and manufacture Component 1 ourselves. For Project B...sigh, from what I can tell, the entire design is not manufacturable. Actually, even when I started, this product was mentioned to have not been ready for launch. Everyone (including sales/ mgmt) has essentially stayed away from it. So, the final product isn't really manufacturable, and neither is Component 1, and no one wants to touch it. Since it falls under my product line, they want me to deal with it.

Project A.1 is *not* assigned to me currently. It is assigned to one of the DEs who took it on after my predecessor quit and while they looked for a replacement. After I started, Project A.1 was never mentioned to me, but apparently at some point it would be transferred over to me (as I learned later). The DE on the project said he was recently instructed by VPE and VPO that it's now my project and to start the transfer. As I have already been looking into the history since I learned it should be mine, I have decided not to take it on, but am recognizing there needs to be 1) a discussion and 2) a proposal for a solution. I am not taking it on because the root issue is not in Quality, it's in the design, and how it's clearly not able to be produced within specs repeatedly. It has been made clear to me, by my boss, VPE, and VPO, that the scope of my projects have to do with Quality and Production improvements only, not anything that stems from New Product Development or derivative designs. 

I don't even know where to start. My biggest assumption is that Ops pushed engineering to sign off on something to launch the products as sales probably had already promised customers the design before it was completed (for both Project A and B). But I can't understand why anyone in engineering, even VPE, would sign their name off on this nonsense. I don't know where to start on walking them through everything, make my case, but still present solutions without implying I am willing to take on the burden of this project. I don't even know what they would be willing to listen to that isn't related to money. Additionally, since it was a surprise to me by the time my goals were set, I don't really have the bandwidth to take it on without dropping something else (which could be resolved but it's a headache).

1588,If you struggle with productivity…,"I’m 27 and just recently got promoted to Assistant Manager of Production Engineering.  This promotion has forced me to take an even closer look at myself and my work habits in an effort to be the best version of myself for my team. 

Before the promotion, I felt I’ve always struggled with undiagnosed ADHD. A major sign of this was decision paralysis at work and at home. 
At work, I’ve always had to-do lists, but I would spend 50% of my day stressed and flustered about what to do next and when to do it. I’m currently have to play the role of Specialist over 6 lines until positions are backfilled (Complete mental chaos trying to juggle both roles’ responsibilities).  
By the time I got home, I suffered even more decision paralysis for the same things—not cooking, not eating, no passion projects, sometimes no showering, etc. just because I couldn’t decide what to do first and was generally overwhelmed with my life. I even toyed with the idea of getting out of engineering because I didn’t think my brain was capable of being so “ON” for the rest of my life. 

Well I got sick of that feeling at home and at work and started making daily plans/outlines with 15 to 60 minute time slots attached to each task.

I cannot stress to you how much this improved my quality of life, especially at work. Taking 10-15 minutes first thing in the morning to create a daily plan leaves me with *plenty* mental capacity throughout the day to make good judgement calls and decisions.
The amount of work I’ve been able to accomplish in 8 hours has completely shocked me, changed my outlook on my career, and even my boss has noticed a change in my general temperament because I’m much happier now. 
It’s also much easier for me to make schedule accommodations when things inevitably come up on the floor that need immediate attention outside of my planned tasks. 

To any engineers (younger or older) who are still struggling with figuring out how to organize their days, maximize productivity, and keep your sanity, I strongly encourage you to try this method just for 1 week at first. 
See how it goes, and decide if it’s a tool you can put into your daily routine, or just on days when you know you have too many things to do.

However, According to a brief conversation, our building retooled all the locks and distributed new keys 2 years ago. Looking closely, I can see what appears (to my eye) to be an abnormally high stress concentration. The number of times you have to use the key in this building is frankly ridiculous. On average, each time one goes outside, including to take out garbage, compost or recycling, it's \~3.5 cycles. I'd estimate at minimum the key has seen 2500 to 12 000 cycles based on what I know about the previous tenants and the uncertainty on the ""2 years ago"" estimate.

I took a macro photo of the tip of a (still good) copy of the key. The thick part at the right side is 1/8 inch, and the ratio at the thinnest part seems to be 0.072, so I calculate a thickness of 9 thou (0.23mm). 

To me, this seems very weak, and I'm not surprised that it's cracked already under 10^(4) to 10^(5) cycles. I don't have a solid grasp of lock mechanism design, so am unsure of loading patterns and I also don't know what sort of material or heat treatment keys generally have.

1635,Building a quieter vacuum?,"So I've recently come into ownership of a desktop CNC. Coolest tool I've ever owned, literally the stuff I can make blows my mind. One issue I have is the noise from my vacuum. I live in a duplex with a shared wall, and my neighbor has complained about the vacuum running for 30-60 minutes at a time while I'm making cuts.

I can't build an enclosure for the vacuum as it's our normal household vacuum (and frankly, I don't have the space for something that large anyway). After doing some searching I came across a couple of videos online of someone using a tupperware bin and a PC style fan to create a vacuum that was at least capable of sucking up what appeared to be skittles. While it appeared to still make a typical vacuum sound it was far quieter than the 70-80db of a normal vacuum.  


I figured I could do the same with some high static pressure fans and a 5 gallon bucket. Since most of what is being sucked up is wood dust, I'm going to assume I don't need 100"" of water lift and can get away with significantly less.

My main questions are:

1. Does this sound feasible? Mostly generating enough vacuum to suck up what I want without generating 70db+ of noise.
2. I've found fans that are capable of 3"" of water lift on their own, but assume I would need to aim for more than that. How much more should I aim for?
3. What would be the proper orientation of the fans to increase vacuum? Running them in series in a tube or laying them in parallel across the top of the vacuum bucket?

I worked at a injection molding company as an Automation Technician and it was really fun but exhausting as hell (12 hour rotational night shifts, plus there were accidents left and right, and only had 1 week of PTO).


I left and got a job at a wireless connector/5g antennae company as a Quality Engineer (bc I had previous experience). I was now on salary, normal working hours, and extremely flexible/unlimited PTO, great 401k match, etc. 
Experience-wise though, I’m don’t think I’m learning as much. Our CNC department has a lot of beef with Quality when there’s only the 2 people left now (used to be 4), and they also scream at people and made my boss cry in a meeting of 10 people. My boss and couple other people from quality made some reports to HR about the toxic work culture but the two main people in HR left the couple months a couple months later. All of the reports were gone into the ether.

My boss switched to IT as an Business Analyst, and I decided to switch to Manufacturing Automation bc I liked the work I did at the job prior and Solidworks/machine design is also what got me interested in engineering in the first place. I applied in December and it was the easiest/quickest interview ever. Although, HR has been struggling for  backfill their 2 positions as well as mine in Quality. 
I’ve been working in both positions for 5 months with no major projects being assigned. 
My new boss doesn’t want to give me automation major projects right now because I can’t delegate 100% of my time to his department. My boss was hounding HR for an offer letter for weeks, and they finally gave him one in the form of a sticky note. They didn’t give me much of a raise so I asked if I could get an official offer letter as well as a higher salary since I was planning on saving up and moving out west to better weather/lifestyle. I’m still waiting to hear back on that. So far I’ll be making $60,000 in the new roll.

I’m also renting right now and our lease is up, so we’re currently staying/paying on a month-by-month basis. We definitely can’t stay another winter because the driveway/neighborhood is a huge hazard in the winter so we’re trying to move out before then. I also have no idea where exactly I want to live and it’s also my first time moving out of state.

Things I dont like that much about my current jobs are things like putting up cables, is more neutral about connecting wires.

Things I like about my work/apprentice test/when I was at school the most was PLC programming and electrical drawings.

My  thoughts about Automation Engineer is that it is related to what I am  already doing so will be easier and wat I am doing now is not wasted. I  know I would enjoy electrical drawing part and PLC programming part, but  I would probably not enjoy budgeting or choosing out different spesific  parts if I had to do that. (Higher ups do that in current job). It  would possibly require more traveling around to different new locations,  something I consider negative. I also dont want to be a lone boss on a  project really, I am too bad at that kind of decisions.

My  thoughts on Computer Engineer(programming) is that, my current  education might still be a backup. Checking out job offers on sites  there seem to be higher need for software programmers than Automation  Engineers currently. I am thinking I might enjoy it because I enjoy PLC  programming but I also know its different, and PLC programming is little  more graphical/physical logic based, so I am not sure if its ""too  theoretical"" for me.

**Units:**

As was stated in the site linked above, the units are as follows,

Q = flow (m\^3/s, in\^3/s)

A1 = area of entrance (mm\^2, in\^2)

A2 = area of venturi (mm\^2, in\^2)

p1 = pressure at entrance (Pa, psi)

p2 = pressure at venturi (Pa, psi)

P = fluid density (kg/m\^3)

**Equation on the site linked above:**

Q=v1\*A1=v2\*A2

p1-p2=p/2\*(v2\^2-v1\^2)

&amp;#x200B;

**Variables:**

Airflow = 0.02m\^3/s

Density = 2.5kg/m\^3

A1 = 78.5mm\^2 -&gt; (5mm radius entrance)

A2 = 19.6mm\^2 -&gt; (2.5mm radius venturi)

&amp;#x200B;

**Test:**

v1 = Airflow / A1 = 0.02 / 78.5 = 0.000255m/s (We take the Q=v1\*A1 formula and modify it to get v1)

v2 = Airflow / A2 = 0.02 / 19.6 = 0.00102m/s (We take the Q=v2\*A2 formula and modify it to get v2)

Pressure drop = Density / 2 \* (v2\^2 - v1\^2) = 2.5 / 2 \* (0.00000104 - 0.000000065) = 0.00000122Pa

As we can see here, if we follow the rules as stated there, we get a miniscule fraction of 1 Pascal! That is almost nothing! Clearly something isn't right, so I had a look through the equation, and noticed that even though the A1 and A2 variables are said to be in mm\^2, in reality they need to be m\^2! So I made the modification to the equation and tried again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Test 2:**

A1 = 0.0000785m\^2 -&gt; (0.005m radius entrance)

A2 = 0.0000196m\^2 -&gt; (0.0025m radius venturi)

v1 = Airflow / A1 = 0.02 / 0.0000785 = 254.8m/s (We take the Q=v1\*A1 formula and modify it to get v1)

v2 = Airflow / A2 = 0.02 / 0.0000196 = 1020.4m/s (We take the Q=v2\*A2 formula and modify it to get v2)

Pressure drop = Density / 2 \* (v2\^2 - v1\^2) = 2.5 / 2 \* (1041216 - 64923) = 1220366Pa

As we can see here, the pressure is now way too high! In bars that would be roughly 12.2 bars which is huge.

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone please tell me what is wrong or missing in this formula? Heck I even tried cm\^2 for A1 and A2 (which logically makes 0 sense whatsoever because that would only work for cm\^3/s, not m\^3. But I got curious) and it returned a result that was also kind of off.

1675,How would I go about making a vibration damper for my house?,"My house is sorta near train tracks. The train isn't really audible from inside, but the house vibrates and you can definitely ""feel"" it. Nothing like vibrating glasses in the cabinets or anything, and something I can live with, but I got to thinking about how I would go about reducing it if I **had** to. I have a few resources and assumptions, and then a few quesitions about construction.

I have:

* An audio recorder to measure the frequency and ampltiude of vibrations. (I don't think this is super great since this is measuring the vibrations in the air and not specifically in the frame of the house). By my ear, the vibration is less than 50hz
* a few locations to hang masses. I can put masses in:

1. my attic (""third floor"", trusses, probably not designed for hanging heavy objects);
2. my garage (adjacent to main floor);
3. and in my basement (I-beam, not engineered beam, for holding up the house);
4. the rear of my house, facing the tracks, not visible from the street.

* build plans for my house (to estimate mass)
* no HOA
* Gumption

I'm a programmer so I don't know a lot about this but I think I need three things figured out, namely the ""mass"", the ""spring, and where it gets installed. What I've figured out in my head amounts to this:

1. The spring ought to determine what frequencies are ""caught."" I don't think it needs to be a spring. It should be able to be any sort of osccilator. I'm thinking for my limited space something like car suspension (not car suspension, similar to car suspension) would be my best bet for this.
2. the mass ought to determine how fast the amplitude of the vibrations is reduced. My gut says that this reduction is a multiplier, and that multiplier is the proportion of the mass vs the mass of my house above the foundation.
3. The location of the mass damper is probably important. I'm thinking the vibrations in the house are greater the further from the center of mass you go, or the furthest from where the hosue is fixed to the foundation, so the best spot to hang a mass damper is in the attic.

And so finally, my three quesitons:

1. How do I select a osccilator? I would need to determine the frequency I am trying to reduce. Once I have that frequency, how do I choose between a spring or a pendulum to serve as my osccilator? Is there another osccilator that would work best?
2. How exactly does the mass of the damper contribute? In terms of orders of magnitude, how much mass should I expect? Surely a 50 lb Plate is too light to be effective for something the size of a house, but I don't know the correct weight.
3. What is the best location for installing a mass damper?

As an aside, at this point I am not really interested in building this (unless it's like super easy haha). I just want to understand the problem better, and the problem solving process. I'm probably going to plant trees to reduce the sound",vibration damper house house sorta near train track train audible inside house vibrate definitely feel like vibrate glass cabinet live think reduce resource assumption quesition construction    audio recorder measure frequency ampltiude vibration think super great measure vibration air specifically frame house ear vibration hz    location hang masse masse    attic floor truss probably design hang heavy object    garage adjacent main floor    basement ibeam engineer beam hold house    rear house face track visible street    build plan house estimate mass    hoa    gumption programmer know lot think need thing figure mass spring gets instal figure head    spring ought determine frequency catch think need spring able sort osccilator think limited space like car suspension car suspension similar car suspension good bet    mass ought determine fast amplitude vibration reduce gut reduction multipli multiplier proportion mass vs mass house foundation    location mass damper probably important think vibration house great center mass furth hosue fix foundation good spot hang mass damper attic finally quesiton    select osccilator need determine frequency try reduce frequency choose spring pendulum serve osccilator osccilator work good    exactly mass damper contribute term order magnitude mass expect surely    lb plate light effective size house know correct weight    good location instal mass damper aside point interested build like super easy haha want understand problem problem solve process probably plant tree reduce sound,0.745588120703116,0.2544118792968804,AskEngineers,AskEngineers

1681,Why do my CAN bus transceivers not work?,"Hi!

I'm working on a project to implement CAN bus using infrared communication as a physical layer. I know it's probably not a great idea, it's just research, if it works it probably won't be fast or long range but that's besides the point.

In order to implement this, I have these DFrobot IR transmitters/receivers: [dfrobot.com/product-351.html](https://dfrobot.com/product-351.html)

I'm using two raspberry pi's, with these CAN hats: [https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RS485\_CAN\_HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RS485_CAN_HAT)

Now, the CAN hats work, and direct wired communication between the two pi's works fine. CAN bus is a differential signal, and I want to use it to trigger the signal on the IR transmitter/receiver. In order to do this, I need to convert the CAN signal into a 0-3.3v simple TTL signal. This, seemingly, should be doable with a CAN transceiver like this: [https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/3/3a/SN65HVD230-CAN-Board-Datasheets.pdf](https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/3/3a/SN65HVD230-CAN-Board-Datasheets.pdf)

Now, I am not even trying the IR tech yet. What I am trying, is to connect these transceivers on either end, connect their tx and rx together, and seeing if CAN communication still works. It does not. The Pi's are able to bring the network up, but messages simply are not received.

To clarify, the system is connected together like so: https://imgur.com/Wv0dCd8 

I've tried various configurations of terminating resistors, and direct CAN hat-CAN hat communication with the Pi's works.

But I know this is too fast for a couple of reasons. One: because I took the surface area as that of a cylinder with the widest diameter of the Pepsi bottle, while the actual bottle narrows down at the top.

Two: because the heat transfer happens at a slower pace because it's not only by conduction. if we assume temp of Pepsi at 20 C (T1 = 20 C), heat transfer occurs first by convection to inner surface of bottle (T2 = ?), then by conduction to outer surface of bottle (T3 = ?) then by convection to the surrounding air of freezer (T4 = -18 C). So all in all it would be slower than what I calculated. 

Also this heat transfer is assuming the bottle stays at 20 C (not happening) and freezer staying at -18 c (probably is happening).

My name is Wray Gabel, I'm a Masters student at the University of Florida advised by Dr. Peter Frederick.

A little about my research--my thesis explores the mutualistic relationship between nesting wading birds and the American Alligator. Basically, wading birds get protection from nest predators (like racoons) and alligators get food from discarded nestlings. I'm looking to 1) better understand what alligators might be getting out of the deal and 2) how this mutualism might be changing wading bird colony location preferences when alligators are not around. I conducted my field work for part 1) in the Everglades and used existing wading bird colony location data from North and South Carolina for part 2).

A little about me--I actually grew up wanting to become a paleontologist, which was really what ignited my passion for field work and biology, but ultimately I found currently existing animals to be more fun than rocks. 

I got my undergrad degree in Biology from Skidmore College, and after graduating I worked with seabirds in Japan (Hokkaido University), wading birds/waterbirds in San Francisco (San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory), and seabirds in Maine (Audubon's Project Puffin). 

I'm mainly interested in the conservation of coastal and wetland ecosystems and hope to do something with wading bird, waterbird, and/or seabird monitoring in my future career as a wildlife biologist. I also minored in Studio Art while at Skidmore and plan to create an illustrated version of my thesis, and I'll be attending an Art-Science residency this fall! I've always been passionate about bridging the (artificial) divide between the two disciplines.

In what little spare time I have I enjoy hiking, traveling, playing video games/board games/rpgs, listening to/collecting music, and doing crossword puzzles!

1725,[UK] Which job role would be more suitable for a future career as a manufacturing engineer in the aerospace sector?,"
Reposting as the last one was taken down for breaking rule number 1. Hopefully this one doesn't, mods if there's any issue please can you let me know as I thought I was being specific enough in my last post. 

I'm a recent graduate with a master's in mechanical engineering. I've recently received two job offers, I've been going back and forth on which to choose but honestly I'm stumped, so I thought I might be able to get some valuable insight from Reddit! 

Neither job offer is in the sector I wish to be in which is aerospace, I'm not sure how much there is in terms of transferable skills etc. So if anyone has any experience switching between these sectors it would be greatly appreciated.

Role 1: Toyota Assembly manufacturing engineer (Graduate scheme)

Responsibilities: investigation &amp; elimination of process defects through route cause analysis and problem solving, improving efficiency etc.

Pros: This one is a grad scheme so has a really structured development pathway, so there will be a proper support structure in place, a mentor, and regular training courses that all graduates need to attend. 

Good salary, hours, Flexi time etc.

The role is for manufacturing, whilst I don't see myself doing this in the automotive sector i would like to do this in the aerospace sector.

Cons: I'm not particularly interested in the automotive industry and don't really see a future within this industry (aerospace is where I see myself in the future)

Role 2: Rolls Royce graduate nuclear submarine engineer

Responsibilities: design &amp; manufacture of nuclear reactor components which power the submarines. (I'm guessing the manufacturing side of things would be similar to the other job, however they haven't told me specifically what I would be doing.

Pros: I'm more interested in this industry than the automotive industry however I still don't see myself in the industry long term.

They may be working on using the nuclear technology for space applications in the future which does interest me.

Good salary, good working hours flexi time etc.

They've indicated that it's possible to apply for roles in different sectors internally which I would look to do to move to the aerospace sector, however I don't know how likely or easy this would be to do.

Cons: it's not a graduate scheme, they say that training will be provided however I'm concerned that I won't see the same level of development or structure than I would get on a graduate scheme, and I'm worried about the volatility of nuclear jobs since it's all govt funded. 

To sum it up, I'm having trouble figuring out which would set me up better to move into the aerospace sector and which would have the most transferrable skills. I'm not sure how different manufacturing engineering is between auto and aero or nuclear and aero.

1756,Why so much confusion about the temporal fenestra in mammals (including humans)?,"So, as a science enthusiast, I'm reading up (on Wikipedia) on the evolution of mammals, about amniotes splitting into the sauropsid and synapsid groups, and about how ""synapsids are distinguished by a single hole, known as the temporal fenestra, in the skull behind each eye"". Since mammals are synapsids, I was naturally curious about how the temporal fenestra manifests itself in modern mammals, and especially whether it's still present in some form in humans, something you'd expect to find discussed at length online.

First, I discover Wikipedia redirects ""temporal fenestra"" to their article on skulls, which states (in a large section without citations) that ""Mammals, which are synapsids, possess no fenestral openings in the skull, as the trait has been modified."") This seems a little strange since the Wikipedia article on Therapsida -- that direct ancestors of mammals -- says they had especially large temporal fenestra, but the article on mammals also mentions nothing about temporal fenestra at all with respect to modern mammals.

Outside Wikipedia, there is surprisingly little about the evolution of the temporal fenestra in mammals. tolweb.com echoes Wikipedia, saying it has been ""drastically modified in mammals"" and ""is no longer a hole in the skull. But [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUtvpezozh8), [are](http://campus.murraystate.edu/academic/faculty/tderting/anatomyatlas/settle3.html), [several](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQqyxWGhHWo), [other](http://bio.sunyorange.edu/updated2/comparative_anatomy/anat_3/s_temporal.htm), [sources](https://www.memorangapp.com/flashcards/7866/Anatomy+-+Feral+Cat+Skull+(Digital+Image) -- including some from higher-ed institutions -- that purport to show a ""temporal fenestra"" or ""synapsid opening"" in mammalian skulls, including human skulls.

So what's the real deal here? And why would there be such confusion over what seems like a pretty significant piece of anatomy, one used as a significant marker for differentiating major groups of tetrapods? And if the temporal fenestra did vanish in all mammals, or just in primates, when does the fossil record show that happening and why did it do so?",confusion temporal fenestra mammal include human science enthusiast read wikipedia evolution mammal amniote split sauropsid synapsid group synapsid distinguish single hole know temporal fenestra skull eye mammal synapsid naturally curious temporal fenestra manifest modern mammal especially present form human expect find discuss length online discover wikipedia redirect temporal fenestra article skull state large section citation mammal synapsid possess fenestral opening skull trait modify little strange wikipedia article therapsida    direct ancestor mammal    especially large temporal fenestra article mammal mention temporal fenestra respect modern mammal outside wikipedia surprisingly little evolution temporal fenestra mammal tolwebcom echo wikipedia drastically modify mammal long hole skull source    include highere institution    purport temporal fenestra synapsid opening mammalian skull include human skull real deal confusion like pretty significant piece anatomy use significant marker differentiate major group tetrapod temporal fenestra vanish mammal primate fossil record happen,0.018798273811901165,0.9812017261880974,AskScience,AskScience

1780,Wireless phone chargers / induction coil power transfer," 

Hiya, got an interesting idea for a prop for an escape room, its just an idea at the moment and if it can be put into action I think it could Be amazing

Basically the idea that I have is using a wireless phone charger to power an LED in a sort of hollowed out ""book"" to be placed onto a bookshelf full of other books, the book being placed will have a magnet in it in a certain position to align with a reed switch which will activate the wireless charger which I hope can be used to send power through the walls of the books to allow an led to turn on

another idea which I think would be less possible than the one previously mentioned is maybe using a sort of magnetic catch inside of a hollowed out book, something maybe like a solenoid lock, and if the book is placed in a certain place, the catch will be set off allowing the book to be unlocked,/opened without having to be attached to anything directly,

hope some of y'all are able to help me with this, I'm just doing some sketches about some ideas right now and don't have the stuff to actually make the props but if I can get the idea through to some people I might be able to make it a reality",wireless phone charger    induction coil power transfer hiya interesting idea prop escape room idea moment action think amazing basically idea use wireless phone charger power lead sort hollow book place bookshelf book book place magnet certain position align reed switch activate wireless charger hope use send power wall book allow lead turn idea think possible previously mention maybe use sort magnetic catch inside hollowed book maybe like solenoid lock book place certain place catch set allow book unlockedopened attach directly hope able help sketch idea right stuff actually prop idea people able reality,0.801991464775785,0.19800853522421624,AskEngineers,AskEngineers

We are paleontologists who study crocodylians and their extinct relatives. While people often talk about crocodylians as living fossils, their evolutionary history is quite complex. Their morphology has varied substantially over time, in ways you may not expect. 

We recently published a [paper looking at habitat shifts across Crocodylomorpha](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-36795-1), the larger group that includes crocodylians and their extinct relatives. We found that shifts in habitat, such as from land to freshwater, happened multiple times in the evolution of the group. They shifted from land to freshwater three times, and between freshwater and marine habitats at least nine times. There have even been two shifts from aquatic habitats to land! Our study paints a complex picture of the evolution of a diverse group.

1784,Systems Engineering as a first job?,"Hello, I started an internship at a tier-one Automotive supplier. I initially applied for an academy they had but the engineer that interviewed me said I did really well and offered me a permanent position. I declined as I'm a 3rd-year university student and simply didn't have the time.  I had no idea what systems engineering was, it sounded interesting, I also needed an internship to finish my semester.  
  So I started, I like the office, the tallest building in the city,  nice view, good colleagues, and good intern salary. They gave me a decent setup. I literally did nothing the first month I was there. Now that I'm going into the workflow, it's just a bunch of DOORS/DNG modules. I can't say there is no logical thinking needed, but considering my colleagues aren't doing a great job, I really don't know. I find some weird mistakes daily, that have been unnoticed for a very long time. Even today while reviewing the work of a colleague I found a really critical mistake that would have gone unnoticed by the reviewers of the other engineering departments, as It's really not their job to look for it. It went unnoticed by another member of our team, who applauded me for finding it. Two weeks ago they gave me a pretty huge requirement, not something I would give to a new intern, I swear I heard someone a few days before that saying that they would give it to me so that they don't have to bother as they are running behind schedule.

   I can say that I'm doing very well at work, but I feel that I'm not really learning anything, at most using the small amount of knowledge I have gathered doing my own project and studying, hard, at university. At the same time, it is VERY draining to write requirements every day.

1793,Why don’t everyday movements cause sub-concussive impacts?,"I’m aware that the brain’s motion is dampened by the cerebrospinal fluid it floats in and by its tethering to the spinal cord and the meninges, but I have trouble seeing how this is sufficient to protect the brain from subtle damage just short of a concussion. 

I tend to visualize a brain-sized egg (with strange holes through the middle for ventricles) in an egg-shaped capsule filled with water (or at least some fluid with the same viscosity) bouncing around as it’s shaken. The brain as an egg isn’t the best analogy for a number of reasons, but it seems to me that motions like head banging, shaking rapidly, turning the head quickly to the side and back, etc. would crack this egg, or at least push it against the walls of its egg-skull with some nonzero force, especially considering that there is little distance between the brain/egg and the skull, and that the fluid isn’t very thick. 

My question therefore encompasses a few questions several of which likely do not have or can not have full answers:
1. Is our brain really moving a lot less than intuition might suggest? 
2. If so, how do we know? Have simulations of this been performed?
3. If not, and the brain does move within our skull as much as such analogies might suggest, does this actually cause any real damage? 

4. Adding to that last bit, what are the mechanisms of potential damage? Are neurons actually dying? Is our brain just chemically disrupted? How resistant to compression is brain tissue (does it “bounce back”)? And given shearing forces can rip axons apart, how much force does this take? Does it occur on some minimal level with all grades of TBI? Is there a particular number of g’s associated with symptomatic damage?

5. To what extent does this depend on individual anatomy, and what research has been done into this?

6. Finally, what is known about the brain’s ability to recover? Does it depend on region (impacted, not geographic)? Genetics? Environmental factors? On a less clinical note, does the brain tend to rewire itself similarly to how it was previously wired, or does it form newer connections based on environment and other factors? What research has been done on these effects in vitro/in vivo/in Volvo? Are we really us after sustaining a brain injury or a series of cumulative small hits? 

Also, as an aside, the argument that evolution has developed mechanisms that prevent significant subconcussive damage (even if we don’t fully understand them) doesn’t seem too convincing either, because evolution only requires that we survive long enough to reproduce, not so much that we perform the kinds of higher order thinking tasks we do today, let alone well into our old age when consequent neurodegenerative disorders might manifest.  

(I hate to add this because it seems rude, but please don’t just link to previous instances of this question on Reddit, as I assure you I wouldn’t post here had I found information that satisfied me. I’m primarily looking for a fairly in depth overview of the state of research into these questions, and perhaps a more rigorous intuitive understanding of the physics of the brain’s motion in everyday movement.)

1807,Unsure of whether to keep trying for Master's Degree,"Hello all! I recently graduated my undergrad in Transportation Engineering and have been working as an EIT in consulting for about a year. I applied to the two universities in my area for a MSc as they're both fairly good for engineering. 

I haven't heard anything back from the universities and so I emailed the admissions officers at both universities, and both responded essentially saying they haven't closed my file because I'm a strong candidate but I obviously can't be admitted without a supervisor. I have reached out to a bunch of supervisors, but I've either gotten no response or that they aren't accepting new students. All completely reasonable, it's just disheartening.

The other option is to do an M.Eng instead, but honestly I'd rather work than do more exams and courses. The main reason why I wanted to pursue an MSc is so I could do research (I am aware I'd still need to do some courses which is fine). I want the MSc to be able to give me the opportunity to pursue a PhD in the future as I want to teach. 

Now, the question is, do I keep trying or as I'm happy working, is it just better to keep working and let go of the master's degree? Is it worth compromising for an M.Eng?

1859,"Female undergrad, am I pigeonholing myself with my internship?","Hi, I’m an upcoming senior in MAE, and I’m not sure if I should be worried by my current internship.

The interns didn’t find out our assigned positions until the first day. 2 of us are girls and we were placed with quality assurance, and the guys were placed in design/manuf roles.

As quality interns we are just populating first article inspection forms. I understand interns are expected to do grunt work! But we rarely interact with our mentor, we sit alone in an office away from the department. I’m not using anything I’ve learned in my classes.

I think this would be a good first internship position! It’s very similar to work I did for my first internship. It just sucks seeing the more inexperienced guys working on the shop floor with their mentors, and we’re copy pasting into excel. The other girl had a manufacturing internship before, my last job was a mix between shop/CAD. I hope this isnt a snobby way to feel, but it was really disheartening dropping the guys off on the shop floor on the first day, then being led away to the offices. It hasn’t been the learning experience I hoped for, I feel like I’m *just* here to get grunt work done, and the internship is paid for by an outside grant..

I want to make the best of it, I’m googling everything I can from the drawings. Some of the shop managers are willing to give us work, and I want to start planning 20min meetups with people around the company to learn about their roles.

I am looking mostly at Electrical Engineering, though I would also like to hear about this topic from the perspective of Aerospace, Mechanical, or Material Science if relevant. I'm not dead-set on a specific career path, as I unfortunately have a very broad interests. I have a slight preference for the topics of signal processing and RF technology, so I'll throw those out there as my possible focus if that helps with answers. I'm faced with the question of applying for a second masters or a second bachelors and I'm not sure which would be better in getting into a career. 

I've been perusing similar past questions asked by others here, but I would appreciate fresh perspective as well. It seems like there is a fair case to be made for doing the bachelors. They often are explicitly ABET accredited, and it sounds like that is a very desirable thing. Though, my understanding is that some portion of employers might be fine with an MSE from a program which also has a ABET accredited BSE. It also sounds like I would possibly still be able to work towards a PE license, should that be relevant to my career goals, even if I went straight to MSE.

I would appreciate any possible insight into whether pursuing an MSE at the expense of a BSE would yield any significant improvement in career opportunities over a BSE. I'd also appreciate insight into whether my current MS in physics would benefit me here if I did complete a BSE. I've often seen employers state that a physics degree would be applicable, but at the end of the day, most of them seem to want to see an engineering degree somewhere on your resume if the job is anything related to engineering.

Regardless of which I would go for, I plan to aggressively pursue internships and anything that will get experience, as that seems to be the obvious number one priority in how desirable you are as a hire.

1 - is a 2k resistor for precharge enough? I did the math and ohms law I=V/R, so 84V/2000R = 0.042A which is good because i wanna trickle charge out the controller caps. but it seems like .042a is so little is that enough to charge my caps? Like in 10-30seconds.

2 - I have read something online about EMF current current in mechanical relays. Apparently when a coil stops getting power the magnetic field of a coil and push lots of voltage through a line which is why I heard something about flywheel diodes to prevent this. But do yall know if they are built into the relay or if I need to add one or if this isn’t even important.

3 - on my main wires going from battery to controller I have a EV200AAANA contactor and a JLLN class t fuse and an branch off wire going to a dcdc converter. Do I need to worry about regen current messing anything up in-line because the current is flowing backwards during regen.

1872,How do I measure the daily production of a quarry rock crusher?,"Hi everyone. I've been assigned an automation project involving rock crushers in a quarry. In short: rocks on a conveyor belt goes through some rock crushers, and at the end of the process I get 3 different sizes of crushed rocks, that go on 3 conveyor belts and end up in 3 different piles.

I need to automate the process and also somehow measure and log the daily production of the 3 sizes of crushed rocks.   
I already solved the automation part. But I'm not sure how to register how much of each rock is produced. At first I thought I could weigh how much is produced by weighing the transport trucks. But since the rock is piled up, the trucks don't necessarely transport all the production of the day.

I also thought about measuring the mass flow on the conveyor belts, and then using the integral of that value over time to get the total mass of rock produced. But I'm not sure that's the best way of doing it.

In that case you would only need to have a few degrees of temperature difference to put a lot of energy into the water at a high COP and have a measurable impact for the fuel requirement of a power plant. In warmer climates there would be plenty of hot air to go around for this.

1876,Water pump code simulation for firefighting training,"Hydraulic/fluid simulation question. If there are any better subs to post this in please let me know! 

I am an electrical engineer currently working on a personal project designing a software simulator for training firefighters in pump operation. It is written in C# using the Unity3D game engine, although I think my questions should be language generic.

&amp;#x200B;

Put simply, I am trying to simulate the input and output pressures and flows of the pump. The dynamic variables controlling these are the RPM of the pump, the lengths and diameters of the hoses connected to the input and output of the pump, the input water source (pressurized or non-pressurized), and the output nozzles on the ends of the hoses with various flow rates.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I've got to so far:

1. Generate a pressure vs. flow curve by interpolating from the published pump curves. [This](https://www.darley.com/documents/performance_curves/HM500-C446.pdf) is the pump curve document I am using.
2. Start iterating at the right-most point of the generated curve (max flow, min pressure).  Using the pump output pressure at that point on the curve, calculate the output flow for the output items using that pressure. I am calculating the output flow using flow vs. pressure graph for the nozzle such as [this one (pg. 7)](https://tft.com/TaskForceTips/media/Resource-Library/lig-010_08.pdf).
3. If the output flow is less than the pump flow for that point on the pump curve, decrement to the next point on the curve to the left and try again.
4. Once the calculated output flow is equal to or greater than the flow for that point on the pump curve, that is the pressure/curve answer.

There are more variables (such as on/off levers) and multiple outputs to deal with, but they should be easier to add after I have this proof of concept working.

My issue is trying to find the pressure drop in the hoses. To find the pressure drop, I use the Hazen-Williams equation (or supplied figures), which needs a flow value to calculate. But this pressure drop will affect the flow value and cause a loop.

Am I approaching this in the right way? Is this simulation even able to be coded like this? It doesn't need to be super accurate. I would greatly appreciate any responses!

&gt;Tests producing so few false positives may sound promising, but any test’s efficacy is dependent upon its accuracy and the prevalence of the disease in the population — **the lower the prevalence, the greater the chance is that a test result will be wrong. For example, if only 5 percent of the country’s population has been infected over the past three months, a test kit that is 95 percent specific will produce five true positives and five false positives,** meaning any result has only a 50 percent chance of being accurate. In that scenario, even a test with 99 percent specificity would produce false positives 17 percent of the time.

I'm having trouble understanding this concept.  Isn't the accuracy of a test simply a ratio of the estimated number of likely false results to the total number of tests given?  How can a test's accuracy vary with the factual probability of the outcome being tested?

&gt;On the other hand, exposition of women to phytoestrogens (isoflavones, lignans, coumestans of different botanical sources) in pre- and postmenopausal period may prevent the menopausal symptoms induced by declined endogenous estrogen production – hot flashes, vasomotor symptoms, vaginal atrophy a.o., whilst no negative side-effect of these phytoestrogens on breast and endometrial health have been observed (Kronenberg and Fugh-Berman, 2002; Branca and Lorenzetti, 2005; Bedell et al., 2012).

[...]

&gt;Meta-analyses indicated no statistically significant association between soy isoflavones consummation and men plasma estrogen and androgen level (van Die et al., 2013). 

And as noted earlier in the review:
&gt;Phytoestrogens are strikingly similar in chemical structure to the mammalian estrogen, estradiol, and bind to estrogen receptors alpha and beta with a preference for the more recently described estrogen receptor beta (Younes and Honma, 2011; Rietjens et al., 2013; Paterni et al., 2014).

[...]

&gt;Phytoestrogens besides their ability to bind to estrogen receptors, have other biological effects, which are not mediated with these receptors

I am hoping someone better acquainted with the literature and reproductive science could help connect all these dots for me. It sounds like phytoestrogens can exert some effects similar to that of estrogens, but in some cases don't exert those effects at all, or exert other unrelated effects.

Some males express concern over the consumption of phytoestrogen-containing foods, e.g. soy, due to perceived risk of 'feminization' through increased 'estrogen' intake.

The book was written in 1997, my question is, what forms of progress have we made since then, and is there anything we can definitely rule out?

For those who haven't read it, he proposes different possible solutions or formats for solutions for the branches between quantum and classical physics. He also raises questions about biophysical processes and consciousness, that maybe there is an answer to be found in quantum level biophysical processes that could explain consciousness in a scientific sense.

If all that seems too hard to answer without actually reading the book, there are three general theses he poses,

1.  Mentality can be treated scientifically 
2. The ideas of quantum mechanics are relative to the mind body problem
3. The quantum mechanical problem of the actualization of potentialities is a genuine physical problem that cannot be solved without modifying the quantum formalism

1934,Does your face get more attractive over time to people who live with you like you do when you look at yourself in the mirror?,"So somewhere I've read that there is some kind of psychological effect that when you look at yourself in the mirror, you only have a set fixed amount of perspectives you can see your face in, and therefore your brain gets used to the image and you usually see yourself as more attractive in the mirror than you do in pictures (because in pictures, you see yourself in perspectives you can't see in a mirror).

Is this semi-true with people who live with you? Let's say you have a roommate, and you meet for the first time, of course you might just be the average looking person and they say ""ew, don't like that face too much"".

Over a year or so of seeing you everyday, do you ""become"" more attractive to them? From personal experience, the mirror thing does work.

Hear me out of my globally petty needs for a thermal cup.

* Chick-Fil-A lemonade and iced tea. I want my drinks to stay cold and not attract condensation. They of course were know to use styrofoam cups for as long as I remember. Some locations perhaps still do.
* Snowballs. A regional treat, at least in Baltimore. Simply crushed ice with a sugary flavoring that you eat with a spoon. There are so many varieties of this in different cities and states. Humid days here are often and the paper cups can slip right out of your hand. Typically I'll eat 1/2 then take it a short drive home and eat the rest. Now at home it's sugary water with some pieces of ice.
* My Parents. I separate this entirely from me because they love ice in every drink. I order them a case of DART foam cups a few times a year. I can't buy these in Costco because they're banned in Baltimore and Florida and other places. Online ordering is not illegal (for personal use).

When I wrote this, I hadn't heard of WinCup. So I will do some research and see if we can use these at home. Until some other time (if WinCup or something else breaks through), we will continue to bring our styrofoam cups when we remember to do so.

Let’s start with the first problem, the pay.   I work with so many BRILLIANT engineers making a little over 20 dollars an hour at nasa.  They all say that they would make 20-40k more per year at most jobs in the private sector.  This can be a huge difference for people trying to support a family or trying to live in a higher cost of living area.  Second problem, the gov benefits are not what they used to be.  The “golden pension” that people use to justify low pay doesn’t really exist anymore.  You can honestly get equal or superior benefits with many companies in the private sector.  My final comment is on the direction Nasa is headed as a whole.  My Nasa center is currently over 65 percent contractors.  These contractors do the same work, get the same badge and make WAY more money than their civil servant counterparts.  And also, MOST OF THE COOL ENGINEERING STUFF IS NOW BEING DONE BY CONTRACTORS.  From speaking to management at Nasa it sounds like they are gradually stepping away from engineering as a whole and letting contractors take over.  I really don’t get why someone interested in the space industry wouldn’t just get a job with a contractor working at a Nasa center instead of a civil servant position.

1982,AskScience AMA Series: We're a group of scientists working on the next generation of solvents for more sustainable chemistry. Ask us anything!,"Solvents are used in a variety of applications - from paints and electronics to pharmaceuticals and agrochemical production. Yet, many pose a hazard to human health and the environment, which means it's more important than ever to create safer, more sustainable alternatives.

We're exploring new applications for bio-based solvents, such as Cyrene™ - a dipolar aprotic solvent that is derived from cellulose and produced in one step from levoglucosenone (LGO), a versatile chemical building block. This solvent can be used for the production and development of active pharmaceutical ingredients, the engineering of plastics and the manufacturing and recycling of electronic components.

In addition to determining new applications for Cyrene™ solvent, we're also working on further developments for other LGO derivatives. These next-gen solvents can play a crucial role in more sustainable chemistry. For example, when compared to N-methyl-2-pyrrolione (NMP) and dimethylformamide (DMF), two solvents under increasing regulatory restrictions due to their toxicity, Cyrene™ solvent offers superior performance in some applications. Additionally, its low toxicity falls well below the hazard thresholds defined by the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals.

I have a background in chemical research-having completed my Ph.D. at the University of York, where I researched green oxidations of organosulfur compounds using hydrogen peroxide. In my current role, I enjoy partnering with academics to introduce novel green chemistry technologies to the scientific community. I was named an Environment+Energy Leader 100 Honoree in 2020.
+ Dr. Jason Camp (/u/DrJasonCamp): I am the chief technology officer at Circa Group. Prior to joining Circa, I had over 10 years of experience as an independent academic at various UK universities, during which I conducted research and published extensively in the areas of green chemistry and sustainable solvents, including Cyrene™. In addition, I have served on the Society of Chemical industry's (SCI) Fine Chemicals Group since 2014 and am currently the secretary of the SCI's Science and Enterprise Group.

Compensation is SKYROCKETING in software, yet it’s stagnant/down against inflation in traditional engineering (unless you have a software adjacent job in a defense company, anyone working in manufacturing is WAY DOWN in compensation). All the talent is fleeing into software as house prices go up and the ability to own a home becomes more difficult.

We were considering what happens to a solar PV array when it is providing load and if the load has a cooling effect on the panel surface. I framed this as a thought problem:

Imagine you had two identical closed systems each containing a solar PV array. One was connected to a resistance heater and one was connected to nothing. Each system receives the same amount of solar radiation so energy input is the same. Since heat input is the same, both systems should reach the same equilibrium temperature. However, for this to happen in the system running a resistance heater, the only reasonable explanation we could come up with is that the inactive array's surface temp is actually lower than the one that is powering the resistance heater.

2050,How would you think about the disinformation problem in America from an engineering perspective?,"Access to good clean information is, to me, as important as access to clean water and electricity and other amenities.

And yet of course unlike clean water and stable power, the truth or reliability of information can be extremely difficult to ascribe a value.

And when the majority of our access and understanding of the world is channeled through our phones through the internet and filtered by social media apps, I worry we are all flooding ourselves with junk information and losing track of reality.

**Q: So I wanted to ask, how would you think about the disinformation problem in America as an engineering problem?**

*Let's take a an example problem: reporting the outcome of an election.*

In America, you have organizations like the Associated Press that have investigated and reportd on elections and their outcomes for over a hundred years.

So when the AP calls elections, you can have high confidence it is the correct call because of the hours of work put in to chasing down sources and information and good reporting.

But on the internet, anyone can create websites claiming whatever they, and high quality information like what's reported on AP gets laundered with disinformation and conspiracies.

Your news says Candidate A won the election, my news site says the election was ""rigged"" and Candidate B is the real winner.

One website says the world is one way, another website says the complete opposite. And we as individuals are supposed to grasp around in the dark and cling to whatever ""feels"" real to us.

But what about the people who just want the ordinary truth, no bells and whistles?

The internet can be like a window to the rest of the world - a way to connect one another in our shared humanity.

Or it can be used to spread lies and conspiracies and groom people to manipulate their behavior and perceptions of politics to win elections.

But when I look up information like the outcome of an election or the headlines, I don't want someone's opinion on it - I want the best most reliable information possible.

And that means having a system that defends reliable sources and keeps out unreliable manipulative disinformation machines.

And we need to think about the user experience - an ordinary person living their life scrolling on their phone. If someone wants news on a certain topic, how do we help them get access without just saying ""read everything and decide for yourself what feels real?""

Thoughts?

How could we create a system that separates and sorts between reliable sources - and the infinite junk information and malicious disinformation on the internet?

You can't stop people from lying - but at some point if enough people believe a rotten lie it becomes *Truth* for a lot of people.

In the same way you wouldn't want a gauge on your machine to give you ""it's opinion"" on a reading - you wouldn't want your ""election gauge"" to give you bad readings.",think disinformation problem america engineering perspective access good clean information important access clean water electricity amenity course unlike clean water stable power truth reliability information extremely difficult ascribe value majority access understanding world channel phone internet filter social medium app worry flood junk information lose track reality q want ask think disinformation problem america engineering problem let example problem report outcome election america organization like associated press investigate reportd election outcome year ap election high confidence correct hour work chase source information good reporting internet create website claim high quality information like report ap gets launder disinformation conspiracy news candidate win election news site election rig candidate b real winner website world way website complete opposite individual suppose grasp dark cle feel real people want ordinary truth bell whistle internet like window rest world    way connect share humanity use spread lie conspiracy groom people manipulate behavior perception politic win election look information like outcome election headline want opinion    want reliable information possible mean system defend reliable source unreliable manipulative disinformation machine need think user experience    ordinary person live life scroll phone want news certain topic help access read decide feel real thought create system separate sort reliable source    infinite junk information malicious disinformation internet stop people lie    point people believe rotten lie truth lot people way want gauge machine opinion reading    want election gauge bad reading,0.5262928243361414,0.47370717566385484,AskEngineers,AskEngineers
2051,How to prevent the detonation of Hydrogen/Oxygen gas produced via electrolysis,"I have a project to build a hydrogen powered t-shirt cannon. To fuel it, I purchased an ""HHO"" electrolysis machine that splits water to produce a mix of hydrogen and oxygen (oxyhydrogen). However, this mixture detonates rather than burning, and I am concerned about the effects of a potentially large detonation on my launcher. I am trying to find ways to slow down the combustion or otherwise prevent detonation. The ideas I have so far are:

* Mix oxyhydrogen with excess air to be leaner (out of detonation limit)
* Mix oxyhydrogen with other fuel to be richer (out of detonation limit)
* Mix oxyhydrogen with inert gas (nitrogen)
* Mix oxyhydrogen with substance to slow down burn (water vapor/mist)
    * For all of these mixing processes will the gasses stay mixed?
* Allow oxyhydrogen to separate by density and tap hydrogen off individually
    * Still need to worry about mixing with air, detonation limit 18 - 59%
* pack combustion chamber with steel wool, mesh, or thin tubes
    * breaks up gas pockets, pulls away energy to slow down burn
    * like a mining safety lantern
* Make gas into a foam
    * Bubbles burn one at a time, not one big detonation
    * I found when burning soap bubbles, a single large bubble made a bigger bang than many smaller bubbles of comparable volume
    * A solid/semi-stable foam could also make metering easier
* Oxidize something to strip away oxygen from oxyhydrogen mix
    * Flow through iron powder?
* Use pure hydrogen (purchased) instead of oxyhydrogen
    * This is supposed to be a promo for a larger ""green hydrogen"" electrolysis setup, so would prefer to use the electrolyzer I have

Do any of these seem feasible?

2052,Do we need to view all observable representation of dimensions using the dimension of time?,"One of the assumptions we make in observing phenomenon is that we are required to observe in ""time"" given that we observe in the physical dimension but bridge that observation to logical dimension for thought. Technically by limiting ourselves to only logic based units of dimensional measure we limit ourselves to only viewing observation with the dimension of time included.   


Superpositioning for example seems illogical as we monitor it in time via snapshots. However when you remove time from the equation you simply see a point of matter with a range of energy levels. No ""action"" is occuring because during superpositioning the forces are impacting dimensions outside of time but we filter the observation through time thus it seems illogical. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think much of this comes down to the current model of spacetime being 3 dimensions of space and 1 dimension of time and assumes that frame of reference is the only reference point required to understand physics.

&amp;#x200B;

 I want to challenge that theory as I believe the more appropriate representation would require 2 or more separate frames of reference if the same identical observation in time are required to properly define quantum physics as we need too look at the manifestation of the phenomenon through the lens of multiple reference points and combine them to define the dimensions of the observable. 

  
As well I think the current view of how dimensions are created is being viewed incorrectly as some observables must be observed outside the dimension of time thus we need a frame of reference other than spacetime. See my tweet below where I go through a physical example of what I think a dimensional model should appear using an empty vape cartidge and explain how you can create 3 dimensions by wrapping one dimension around another than pushing it into a third dimension.

2057,Good Methods of Checking for Poor Weld Leaks? Also Electrical Coolant Dyes.,"A big problem with electrical transformers is welding fuckups and leaking oil. One (primitive) way of checking for welding leaks is covering the thing in soap water, pressurizing it, then looking for bubbles. I’ve been looking into better methods for finding weld leaks early and it seems like an ultrasonic scanner is the best — like the GE Inspection Technologies USM 35 (like this: https://youtu.be/CFd_WCbrPiw).

2058,Why does the expansion of the Universe slow towards a stop if the spacial curvature is zero/flat?,"As I understand it we are pretty confident that the universe has no spacial curvature or at least it is very very close to being flat. This was contradictory to what you would theoretically calculate it to be using the Friedmann equations and measuring the amount of stuff in the universe, so the cosmological constant was added in to give us the answer of zero spacial curvature that complements what we actually see in reality.

My question is how does adding the cosmological constant in, which gives empty space a constant energy (not diluted as it expands), slow the universe's expansion to zero over infinite time?

I understand what it's doing mathematically just looking at the balance of the Friedmann equation but I can't picture how adding something in that has constant energy density, and thereby increases in total energy as space expands, would slow down the expansion of the universe and yet still be the cause of the accelerated expansion of the universe we call dark energy.

I suspect my misunderstanding might be in my last point about dark energy, but as far as I can recall everything I've ever read about dark energy causing the acceleration of expansion has pointed to the cosmological constant as the likely (confirmed?) culprit.

2102,How did the flaw causing purple streetlights become so widespread?,"Right now, tons of street lights have been turning purple all across North America (possibly more widespread than that, but all evidence I've found is from all over the US &amp; Canada).

Why the lights turn purple has been explained tons already - Googling the problem shows up tons of local news articles explaining the problem. Essentially, these ""white"" LED lights actually use purple LEDs with a phosphor coating that glows white, and there's a flaw causing the phosphor to fail, so what we're seeing is the underlying LED color.

But one question I haven't seen explained anywhere: how did this flaw become so widespread?

Given just how widespread the problem is, I can't help but wonder whether these bulbs are all by the same manufacturer, or it it's affecting multiple (surely the manufacturer would have caught the problem fairly quickly and issued a stop-ship?). Could it be multiple manufacturers that all use the same phosphor vendor? Was there an environmental regulation change causing several manufacturers to change phosphors all around the same time?

It seems it's not caused by supply chain problems, as some of these bulbs were installed before 2020.

And then there's what's actually causing the phosphors to fail.

2109,"Blackbody radiation, how does it work?","This chapter about light interactions with matter in my astronomy textbook is only 10 pages but it's taken me hours to understand. Ive watched videos but they get too complicated with stuff i havent heard of or isnt in this textbook.

This is what i understand for the most part: an object glows when it gets hot because the neutrons colliding give off electromagnetic radiation. As the temperature rises the color of the glow changes from red to yellow to blue.

Why do moving and coliding particles give off electromagnetic waves such as visible light or infrared?

Why do colder objects give off longer waves and hoter objects give off shorter waves?

Does an object have to be black to be a blackbody?

Do all objects give off blackbody radiation?

If stars can be so hot to be red, yellow, or blue does this mean they are or near black in color? If so what makes a star black? Can a star be invisible to our eyes by emiting only ifrared or UV light?

Basically i understand what is happening to a blackbody object, i just dont get why it happens or what makes it happen to one object and not another.



Another thing from this chapter that is less relsted to astronomy:

Atoms can obsorb photons if the wavelength of the photon has the right amount of energy. Waves without the correct energy just get bounced off, right? Is the bouced off wave the color we see with our eyes?

in the book it says an atom that obsorbs a photon of the corect wavelength becomes unstable(due to neutron changing levels) and re-radiates the photon in a random direction. If the atom is constantly re-radiating photons of different waves how does something stay one color?

So for example in an optical fiber cable you can't send very short pulses because the Fourier transform of that pulse would have frequencies components beyond the limit of the optical fiber.

Remote jobs seem pretty promising in that aspect but they do seem to be in high demand.

I am in the very beginning stages of this paper, but am looking for some guidance as to some things that would be important to mention in the paper, as well as things you may think are important to consider. Currently, I am beginning to talk about the urban decentralization that can be seen in the United States and how that makes it hard for transportation such as passenger railway.

I became one from Tier-1 University of my country by CHEATING on an entry exam, *CONFESSION*(at that time, i called it my luck, but now i call it my worst mistake). Fast forward, I graduated with the lowest CGPA 2.1 out of 4.0 because of zero interest. I landed my first civil engineering job at field with my father reference and i realized i did a big mistake and i couldn't hate Civil Engineering more. Cherry on top, i was paid peanuts. As i possess creative and sharp mind, i realized quickly that i CAN NOT work on site as field engineer at all because i am not accustomed of tough conditions, i cant do structural engineer job role as it requires to play with numbers and some strong structural concepts, so i chose planning engineer role which requires you to sit on computer and use softwares Primavera P6, Microsoft office to monitor progress. I thought i found a way out but i realized after 10 years that you cant go to higher levels until u have field knowledge in this field as well.

Surely it would be easier for construction and design purposes if everything was consistent, why go out of your way to change it?   


I’ll offer my best guess - if the road the ramp comes off of has more people turning right onto it and few people turning left, less people would have to change lanes if the the left lane merged into the right.

2187,Why can't I receive information from the future via delayed choice quantum eraser with a different beam splitter?,"It seems that you cannot send information to the past (aka receive information from the future) with delayed choice because the waveform interference pattern cannot be understood with the screen alone because you need to first examine the detectors to make sense of the dots on the screen.

The current thinking seems to be that you cannot send information across time because in the scrambling ""eraser"" section of the experiment, we send photons through a beam splitter which results in 50% landing in detectors C and the other 50% in detector D. Due to the fact their interference patterns subsequently are perfectly out of phase, you cannot decipher waveforms with the screen alone because without being able to reference the information in the detectors, the screen alone just looks like a bunch of unorganized dots with no apparent interference pattern.

However, is there a beam splitter available to science which could send most of the photons to one of the two detectors (for example, 99% go to detector C once they are in the eraser portion of the experiment).

It would seem to me that if there's a beam splitter than can send most of the photons just to detector C (99% instead of 50%), you would pretty clearly be able to see either a waveform or not, despite a little bit of fuzziness.

This idea also seems like it would not violate nature's rules about not having certainty about path information to get the waveform interference pattern.

2193,Is it realistic to turn mobile AC into essentially central AC,"Couldn't think of more specific title, since I have multiple questions regarding this. Also not entirely sure this is best suited sub, considering I'm not looking for something accurate, just more of eyeballed idea verification.

Context - got mobile ac that's too loud to sleep next to and can't get a proper ac with compressor outside. So I thought it might be fun trying to solve this problem.

My idea is to place ac into a different room then use collapsible pipe with some sort of 3d printed adapter to push cold air into bedroom.

First set of make it or break it problems/questions:

- Will simple ac fan generate strong enough air flow to properly push air through the pipe, assuming the adapter is mostly air tight?
- Will the air stay cool enough (let's say distance is 5m and it's generic plastic collapsible pipe without insulation)?

Another part is hot air exhaust
- Is the reason behind manufacturer advice of having as short exhaust as possible and to avoid sharp corners is simply to minimize heat bleeding into the room you're cooling it doen?

2196,"How porifera (sponges) life-cycle, reproduction and longevity is affected by its environment and life in colony?","Hello, i'm developer for educational aquarium game/simulator, we're implementing poriferas, and i have some niche questions for someone with experience/expertise in tropical/salt-water sponges. I did my search, looked through Google Scholar and Books, and unfortunately could not find conclusive answers, so i would be very thankful if any of r/AskScience marine biology scholars/students would be able to spend 30 minutes for answering questions below.

All questions are about average/most common species of porifera phylum. I understand there are extremities and notable differences between species, but i will refer here as ""sponge"" to the average/most often documented behaviour, or the specie You are most comfortable to answer about.

1) Does every sponge reproduce? If there is colony of sponges, is there some kind of ""monarch"" that reproduces more often? Does sponge age affects it fertility? If sponges reproduce annually, can something break the cycle? Do they reproduce every year until death? What environmental mechanism regulates whether sponge reproduces in K/r strategy, does it only vary between species and is independent of available resources?

2) What is the reason for sponges dying ""of old age"" if there are no organs to fail? Do sponge cell replication mechanism is limited by telomers length like in other animals? Is sponge in colony individual organism that lives and dies on it's own ""cycle"", or is part of one single organism, similar to fungi? Does sponge live as long as the colony, and dies only due to environment change/depletion of resources, or do they just die-off more or less in order of being born?

3) In the rare case of sponges that reproduce by budding (and for the species that are hermaphrodites and germinate without other specimen) - is the sponge heir a perfect clone of parent, or does random minuscule mutations happen in the process of reproduction noticeably more often than in case of normal sponge cell replication? Is there some time threshold (linked to annual reproduction cycle) after which sponges capable of self-germination do it?

I would be very glad if anyone can at least partially clarify those topics, or forward me to someone who would find time to do it. Thank You very much.

I looked at the data that Wikipedia had and did a quick back-of-the-envelope estimate of Miranda's visual cross-section and calculated that it was around ~4/25 that of Umbriel's. That explains why it was discovered later than the other moons but why did it take almost a century when it would only have taken an increase of a telescopes diameter by 2.5 would have boosted light collection enough to make it as bright as the other moons seen with the smaller telescope. It isn't that dark, in fact its albedo seems relatively high so that isn't why we didn't find it. How did an entire moon nearly 500 km across manage to go unnoticed until the first half of the the 20th century was almost over?

2209,Materials and heat absorbption/reflection.,"The context is about motorcycle summer gloves. Most motorcycle riders have learned to not buy/use black motorcycle gloves, because gloves being directly exposed to the sun during rides, black attract a lot of heat. 

Black being your worst ennemy when it comes to heat absorbtion is a given, but what about the material used in the gloves ? 

One question I have is leather vs mesh kind of gloves (example of mesh gloves :  [https://www.alpinestars.com/products/copper-gloves?variant=31614551785530](https://www.alpinestars.com/products/copper-gloves?variant=31614551785530) ). Let's imagine both the leather and the mesh gloves are white, would the material factor in much ? Would leather absorb more heat than mesh ? Is there a general rule to that, like the more denser and heavier the material, the more it absorb heat ? 

The second question is regarding carbon fiber or thermoplastic. Most gloves features knuckleguards for metacarpal bones protection (example here : [https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0508/5085/7149/products/3567319-1231-800-800-MantainAspectRatio\_800x450.jpg?v=1606843531](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0508/5085/7149/products/3567319-1231-800-800-MantainAspectRatio_800x450.jpg?v=1606843531) ) Most of the time, those knuckles guard are black or in very dark tone. The thing is, they're not directly in contact with the hand, there is some padding between your skin and those guard. Does it matter if they're black in this case ? Does carbon-fiber and thermoplastic absorb heat much ?

2225,AskScience AMA Series: I am Dr. Nina Kraus and will talk about how music and concussion impact brain health. Ask Me Anything!,"How do our experiences, such as learning how to play music and playing sports, affect our brain? Although we are surrounded by sound all of the time, we rarely give much thought to this invisible yet powerful companion. The auditory system is a uniquely complex sensory system and the ability to make sense of sound relies on exquisite precision by the brain. Given the complexity and precision of the auditory system, accurate sound processing is particularly vulnerable to head injury. On the other hand, its precision can be honed by activities that exercise the auditory brain such as playing a musical instrument.

We have discovered a way to objectively capture the imprint that sounds leave on our brains. This biological approach empowers us to learn more and more about this invisible ally and enemy of brain health. Dr. Kraus will examine the promise of measuring soundprints in the brain to assess and manage sports-related concussions. She will discuss how music training is beneficial for the brain, strengthens our communication skills, and can inform health care, education, and social policy.

Dr. Kraus will be here at 2:00 CT (3 ET, 19 UT). Ask her anything!

2244,Where does the heat for a ground source heat pump actually come from? The air?,"So I don't really understand the heat flow with a heat pump. Ok, so you pump the heat from/to the ground, but where does that heat in the ground then come from?

## Is it from the earth's core?

Some back of the envelope calculations: [Geothermal heat flow (heat from the Earth's core) is ~65 mW/m2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_gradient#Heat_flow). [Heat pump with a horizontal trench loop need roughly 2500 ft^2 ground area for 12 kBTU/h heating](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/CIS_EO_KC-MAY06-Workshop_159640_7.pdf), which is 15 W/m^2, an order of magnitude more than geothermal heat flow, [even on upper end of the spectrum](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/2011-Geothermal-Heat-Flow-Map-of-the-Continental-US-Blackwell-et-al-2011_fig2_280308329).

## It must come from the surface air then?

[Thermal conductivity for soil (""clay minerals"") is 3 W/m/K](https://open.library.okstate.edu/rainorshine/chapter/13-2-soil-thermal-properties/). With a trench depth of ~6ft and using previous 15 W/m^2 density, you'd need a 9C (16F) minimum temperature difference between the surface. Which sounds plausible, except that's not what happens. [The supply temp is pretty much constant regardless of whether not it's pumping heat](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/CIS_EO_KC-MAY06-Workshop_159640_7.pdf). Plus, some of these things could be buried 400ft deep in a vertical bore configuration! In which case you'd need like a 610 C difference!

## If it's not from the core, not from the air, is it just acting like an isolated thermal reservoir?

[Heat capacity of soil minerals is 1.94 MJ/m^3/C](https://open.oregonstate.education/soilhydrologyandbiophysics/chapter/heat-flow-and-thermal-effects-in-soils/). [Total natural gas consumption in winter is ~57.7 Mcf](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=50076), which is equal to 57.7 MBTU of energy, which gives you 1108 K*ft^3 of soil thermal load. Even if you size this for a small furnace 40 kBTU, you spread this out over 8333 ft^2, and assuming heat travels only 1 ft above and below the loop, then you only change the soil temp 0.067 K over an entire winter.

So that works, but it smells a weird to me. If the ground is such a good reservoir and the pump only changes the temperature so little, why wouldn't you just make the loop area much smaller to save on cost? From my guestimates, you could easily make the thing 10x smaller and still maintain pretty good efficiency. Plus why even bother drilling so deep for vertical loops? Was there a bad assumption somewhere or did I calculate something wrong?

## What's going on here?

So from what I figure, the ground acts like a giant heat reservoir, which then very slowly (like over the time scale of a year) equilibrates with the air? So ""Ground source"" doesn't really mean ""from the ground""? it's just using the ground as a incredibly slow but gigantic evaporator?",heat ground source heat pump actually come air understand heat flow heat pump ok pump heat fromto ground heat ground come    earth core envelope calculation geothermal heat flow heat earth core    mwm heat pump horizontal trench loop need roughly    ft ground area    kbtuh heating    wm order magnitude geothermal heat flow upper end spectrum    come surface air thermal conductivity soil clay mineral    wmk trench depth ft use previous    wm density need c f minimum temperature difference surface sound plausible happen supply temp pretty constant regardless pump heat plus thing bury ft deep vertical bore configuration case need like    c difference    core air act like isolated thermal reservoir heat capacity soil mineral    floatnum    mjmc total natural gas consumption winter    floatnum    mcf equal    floatnum    mbtu energy    kft soil thermal load size small furnace    kbtu spread    ft assume heat travel    ft loop change soil temp    floatnum    k entire winter work smell weird ground good reservoir pump change temperature little loop area small save cost guestimate easily thing x small maintain pretty good efficiency plus bother drill deep vertical loop bad assumption calculate wrong    figure ground act like giant heat reservoir slowly like time scale year equilibrate air ground source mean ground use ground incredibly slow gigantic evaporator,0.4810896286680171,0.5189103713319767,AskScience,AskEngineers

Would it be better to do the aerospace dynamics, and do a thesis on something F1 related, to keep more doors open?

Or if this is genuinely an issue for engineers. I earnestly swear that 90% of the engineers I have met, in my admittedly limited experience, have been alcoholics. (A smaller percentage have been sexual predators, but that is another story.) One person told me they only hire people, for a big company, that they can drink with. That set my red flags off hella hard. Tonight at my temporary job, until I find something entry level in engineering, I consoled an older man who was having some sort of horrible life/career crisis due to drinking. He turned out to be an engineer. Almost all of my classmates had issues with substance abuse. It was a horrifically toxic environment though, so I can’t blame the students at all. The professors were *just* as addicted to alcohol. Something that became more apparent to me the longer the degree dragged on. I’ll drink sometimes, but I’m not getting black out drunk every weekend, or walking around reeking of booze during the day either.

How do I find work with healthy people who are happy and not miserable? I’m still traumatized by some of the stuff I went through in college admittedly.

2299,Negotiating Pay after signing while still in school,"Situation: 

I've been working in a part-time co-op position for an engineering company during my senior year of college in mechanical engineering. During this summer, I have been working full time on the same engineering team, and I really enjoy the work. I am returning to school for \*one year\* to complete an accelerated masters in electrical engineering. I will be working part-time on the same team during this period as well.

&amp;#x200B;

This company often sends out post-graduation job offers or even internship offers very early in the hiring season (End of July to September) for positions that they are looking to fill in the next summer after May. I'm going to be offered a full-time position (in the next few weeks) for after I get my master's, and I am wondering if it is ever acceptable to negotiate pay after an offer has been signed. Because this company signs people on so early, it's very difficult to find any competing offers from companies since most companies are looking to fill positions now, rather than a whole year from now.

&amp;#x200B;

Question:

I want to be competitive with the salary I am offered, but I don't think it's possible to get an offer from another company with the same June 2023 starting date within the next month. **How bad/acceptable would it be to sign the offer, and then in the January - May 2023 timeline, return to my current company with competing offers and attempt to negotiate an increase in pay if possible?** Would I be scoffed at by my manager or HR? Or as a student still, is there more unspoken flexibility when it comes to these early career salary negotiations.

&amp;#x200B;

I know in the past, there is usually a lot of sensitivity when it comes to signing job offers and then backing out afterwards to take something else. But in the past few years of engineering school, I've noticed that is a much more common thing to do and companies don't seem to be as offended as I would expect by people signing and then rescinding later on. Especially for 'fresh' college graduates just starting their career. Several people I know often sign multiple offers before graduating, and then back out of a couple in the last couple months of school once they decide what they want to do.",negotiate pay signing school situation work parttime coop position engineering company senior year college mechanical engineering summer work time engineering team enjoy work return school year complete accelerated master electrical engineering work parttime team period company send postgraduation job offer internship offer early hiring season end july september position look fill summer offer fulltime position week master wonder acceptable negotiate pay offer sign company sign people early difficult find compete offer company company look fill position year question want competitive salary offer think possible offer company june    start date month badacceptable sign offer january       timeline return current company compete offer attempt negotiate increase pay possible scoff manager hr student unspoken flexibility come early career salary negotiation know past usually lot sensitivity come sign job offer past year engineering school notice common thing company offend expect people sign rescind later especially fresh college graduate start career people know sign multiple offer graduate couple couple month school decide want,0.9998398228353712,0.00016017716463081027,AskEngineers,AskEngineers

After 3 months in operation, it was observed that the correct positive pressure in the room can no longer be maintained, so production has been stopped, in accordance with quality protocols.

The Engineering Director has asked me to review the situation.

Things I've checked so far:
1) Any leakages in the hvac system + clean room
2) Any faults within the fans
3) Replaced the HEPA filter with a new one (as i assumed that this was causing the pressure drop)
4) Checking the microcontroller that regulates the fan speed (ultimately effecting the inside pressure)

Also, a large amount of energy is spent getting a massive vehicle to accelerate and decelerate repeatedly.   I propose a long train like Snowpiercer that never stops. To get on and off you would board a single self propelled car or a smaller train.   The small one catches up to the larger one using far less energy since you are accelerating less mass. The trains couple at high speeds.  People that want to travel long distance get on the big train. People that are getting off at the next stop fill the smaller train and then they decouple and the small train slows to a stop at the next stop. The track would be dedicated for high speed rail and would make a large loop, perhaps the size of the Eastern Seaboard or the whole lower 48.  Trips would be faster and uninterrupted.  I realize this would be an expensive proposal but I wonder how it would compare to current train travel in terms of efficiency, cost, convenience, and fuel consumption.

In the experiment, a source sends out a pair of entangled photons to two detectors that measure the incoming light. Both detectors are equidistant from the source such that they should receive their individual photon simultaneously. Each detector is equipped with a controllable polarized beam splitter (with three potential positions: +30, 0, -30 degrees) that separates the incoming light into vertically and horizontally polarized light. When both detectors have the same polarization in their beam splitters, the results measured by the detectors are correlated.

The text first suggests the following (incorrect) hypothesis: if both polarizers have the same orientation, the detectors return the same result. If the polarizers have different orientations, the detectors don't get the same result.

2358,Expected value of rolling 3 dice and keeping best 2?,"The average value of rolling a single die is easy to calculate, you just average the values of all its sides: 3.5 for a 6 sided die (d6), 2.5 for a 4 sided die (d4) etc. So then it’s easy to calculate the average value for 2 (or more) of them: 7 for 2d6, 5 for 2d4 etc.

But it gets more interesting when you roll 3 dice and keep the best 2. It’s easy to come up with an average through a Monte Carlo type simulation, but I haven’t had any ideas for how to solve this through an exact mathematical/probabilistic approach.

2392,What are the defining characteristics and mechanics pertaining to horseshoe orbits?,"Hi all, this is my second thread and post here on Reddit, so I hope that it's at least partially up to snuff.
So in this thread, I hope to have an informed discussion about all the viable mechanics and situations that surround co-orbital moons (or planets) that have a unique orbital pattern in respect to their primary, called a horseshoe orbit. I would like to see what effects it has on the two main bodies of the system as well as any surrounding bodies, including the primary. 

For anyone who does not know anything about horseshoe orbits, I will include some links to resources at the bottom.

I will try my best to add any relevant new questions to this first post as time goes on (including those found later in the thread). To keep things organized for future readers, if you have an answer or would like to discuss one of the specific topics, I'd appreciate starting any replies to my points with a prefaced set of number ex:
(1.
Words, words, words, etc.

4.
Words, words, words, etc.)

Alright, so here are some questions and points to get started.

1. Do horseshoe orbits have a semi-stable relationship? A.K.A. Will they stay in a similar orbital path for around 50+ million years, and if not, how will their orbits likely change?

2. Would it ever even be possible, however far fetched, to have a third or fourth body added to the horseshoe relationship?

3. Can the orbiting bodies have nearly any mass (as long as they are similar enough) and their primary is massive enough?

4. I'd most appreciate the answer to this one. Can you have a stable horseshoe orbit that is also eccentric (say .2-.4)? I want to know, because I'm trying to find a way around having tidally locked moons, which can be avoided in one way by having an eccentric orbit that can give higher spin orbit resonances than the 1:1 that tidal locked bodies have.

5. How similar do the orbiting bodies have to be in size and mass?

6. How much less massive do the orbiting bodies have to be than their primary?

7. Could a moon orbiting one of two horseshoe orbiting gas giants swap which planet it is orbiting via going in a figure 8 sort of orbit temporarily, or going around the outside the other one to start its orbit that way when the gas giants get close? Also, if this is possible, is there any way at all it is viably stable to do this nearly every time the two get close?

8. Do any types of horseshoe orbit have significant effects on nearby bodies like rings and other satellites?

9. Can a rocheworld be one of the bodies in a horseshoe orbit, and would it be naturally tidal locked unless otherwise acted upon?

Here are some resources for those who may be unfamiliar.

2397,A few questions about connecting with recruiters on LinkedIn,"Hello everybody, I am a recent ME graduate who has been trying to get into the space industry. I am interested in companies like Relativity Space, Lockheed Martin, Sierra Space, ULA, and others. I don't have direct connections, so I haven't had too much luck yet aside from a recent screening interview with one company that makes me believe that my resume is hopefully strong enough.

To increase my chances of finding a space-related position, I have started to consider messaging recruiters for these companies on LinkedIn instead of just applying to a lot of positions. I believe that I have the passion to be successful, and a lot of people in my position that I have talked to don't seem to consider this approach. I have read posts claiming that this is a successful method, but I had a few questions before I start:

**How do you find the ""right"" recruiter?** It seems like when you google ""*company* recruiter on LinkedIn"", a wide variety of people pop up. If I am looking at a certain position(s), I fear that I could be wasting somebody's time if they don't deal with the hiring department. In my experience, all of these companies hide any contact information for their postings.

**What can I do to sell myself in the best way possible?**  Aside from expressing your interest and qualifications, what else should/shouldn't you include? I don't want to come off as phony, desperate, or anything else especially as an entry level engineer.

I appreciate any advice that you have. This is certainly a difficult industry to get into, but I am trying to be open-minded by not being picky with the company, position, or location as long as they work in the space industry.

2401,"I can't understand things taught in MIT, NPTEL, Coursera, Standford, Big universities in USA, what could be reason?","I think it's obvious that I am computer engineering student.

1) But I can understand them if I read a good book about it. I can understand it myself by analyzing lots of information available in internet (text mostly).

2) you might think I am a textual learner but I am not. I am a visual learner who learns through videos. 

3) You might think I am not learning from them because they are long but no, I can watch 1 hr long videos and understand as well if the videos are good (in the sense that I can understand). I have watched a single video of 2 hrs for like 10 times without getting bored(I understood it once didn't make notes, lost notes, so had to rewatch after a long time to revise)

4) You might think I don't have the basics,but I have cleared every exams preriquisites and not just passed but passed with good understanding of subject. My goal of learning is ""mastery"" and I really don't care about getting marks in exam as it requires me to become more focused on exams and do more memorization rather than learning. But I would ofc be happy if I could score better marks. PS I don't do well in exams where I have gone by reading books compared to exams where I have gone by watching video tutorials.

5) I am from Nepal. although I don' have any language problem, but I prefer indian educators more than western ones. But still I didn't understand shit from NPTEL which is made by indian educators. I don't remember anything that I learnt online from non indian educators(video).Books are fully written by western educators. But even in books, I would better understand stuffs(mathematical stuffs not theory, indians are bad with concepts) from indian  writer books. Concepts are OP in western books.

6) I really feel that this is a major hurdle in my life.  I even have difficulty understanding articles written by bloggers online. I can't understand wtf are they trying to teach. It feels like they are blabbering like an empty vessel who have no knowledge. My friends have no problem with them, they learn from even shittier resources and are doing  very well in professional life as well as examinations(They are hired in fortune 500 companies level companies in Nepal already). So I think I have some problem.

7) Now you might suggest ask to teachers and teaching assistant. LOL there are no teaching assistant. And I respect my teachers. at least I had teachers. But teachers are extremely shit(That is my pov,my friends have no problem with them I haven't seen their scores, but some of them are scoring really well even with those teachers' learning, I don't know if they did this by self studying so pardon me for that). Hence I think I must be dumb.(Although quality of teaching is obviously low in Nepal even tho teaching engineering is handsomely paid...like 60-80K per month..you know if you are good with computer science research, you won't stay in Nepal and instead go to europe and usa for research. and if you are good with computer science practicals, you will get a programming job instead..so we have lack of great teachers. i had 0 computer science teachers that made me fall in love with subject lol(that is my pov, idk if my friends find them good, but most students aren't satisfied with them that is surely i know...but there are students who scored perfect marks as well)

8) I know I am dumb because I am bad with computer programming as well even though I understand most topics that I have learnt in last 1 years. 

9) You might think I hate depth knowledge, but it is not like that I like to learn everything in depth and as a result I study too much depth but it impacts my exams as exams in UG just want to know the introduction. I am trying to fix that by making a list of questions that I have topics that I want to read and I have kept them in gdocs so that I can read them if I want once exams are over.


Honestly, I don't understand why I shouldn't be understanding those lectures. Some people suggest that you need to google what is taught in videos if you get confused and learn but LOL. if you start to google stuffs you don't learn in 1.5 hrs video, then i am damn sure learning 1 video(which might not even be teaching 1 topic, it might require 2 videos lol) will take 2 days of 8 hrs study each day. This is simply not feasible. Videos learning should be the medium, where if you follow from the beginning, you should be getting most things and confusing should be minimum as minimum as it can get.

So I reject the idea that you should google what you don't understand via video.

Now to share videos that I didn't understand( I don't understand anything but I will give you some examples of those videos). 

Search ""the diagonalization principle"" in youtube. and see that university course video  which is longer than 20 minutes, about a hour or such recorded by a poor camera.

search ""data mining nptel"" in youtube. fck man. i took data mining elective because of that course and i was like WTF HOLY SHIT ""I DON""T UNDERSTAND SHIT told here"". I made my way through that course using slides in internet and got a pretty decent marks by Nepalese standards, 2nd tier marks I must say.

search ""formal languages and automata theory nptel"".

search ""artificial intelligence nptel"".

One course that I understood even though it was from university was this-:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swtH_okidQc&amp;list=PLUtfVcb-iqn8dG1-Cn7NTEdILR3hRVgcN

this was a lovely course.

another course that i loved was this
(I watched just 1 lecture from this)


and holy fck this was the amazing course i ever had. this fucker dr ranjan bose simplifies stuffs like i am 5. he breaks his lessons in pieces and teaches. holy fck, i used to fap daily studying ""data communication"". it was such a tough and fun course. trellis encoding and viterbi decoding you beauty...holy fffkk.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4dzerJHIFw&amp;list=PLp6ek2hDcoNBtaNoXzFE3BYKNZ2kUJo1f

and another legendary course that i loved was this-:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3slBe2r8vA&amp;list=PLq-Gm0yRYwTgX2FkPVcY6io003-tZd8Ru

holy shit...while not all lectures are easier to understand, many of them are valuable asf.

sometimes i wonder if i should leave computer science, as you can see that i find electronics related subjects easier to learn from these university courses rather than computer science concepts. 

not to that extent of those ranjan bose's lectures and ajit pal lectures,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lKsSiEsJ18&amp;t=1771s

also mausam's ai course was decent for some topics(he doesn't make things simpler..he is not a great educator, but i decently liked him)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHpchgLoDvI&amp;list=PLp6ek2hDcoNB_YJCruBFjhF79f5ZHyBuz

but i loved this course as well to some extent. the pdfs were interesting. it was useful to me for some topics i won't lie. 

i feel like these colleges like MIT, standford, IIT(old iits) courses are made for genuis students in mind and not an average learner like me. iit guwahati courses aren't that great, but you can easily sense some kind of simplicity in learning in those course.

lectures that i hated was these-:

i hated this embedded guy-:

although i felt i understood those materials were fcking outdated shit..and his slides weren't easy to grasp for my dumb brain.

meanwhile for same subject, i loved this fcker-:

these courses fcked the shit out of me and i didn't understand anything taught in  this courses. (I wasn't at the right mental state at those times but even if i was, i would not have understood these courses).

And leave MIT lol. MIT courses are fcking unrelated to my syllabus that I have never even opened. They try to teach in too woke way, too practically, that they miss teaching the concepts.(totally my pov, i am not saying this is for everyone). i need to be taught like a great book writer teaches his readers. as i said i am extra dumb. 

i fcking hate these internet articles, i wish nobody wrote these nonsense articles in internet. most are garbage, you learn nth from them. you learn better if you read a book about it. i am not talking about reading a whole 1000 pages book(i am having to read it atm because computer network and internet technology, it is fcking hard lol) just few pages to learn that concept.

Note-: I am active in like 200 forums including subreddits. Asking questions has helped me somewhat. But I won't say that it has helped my learning process. It has helped my part of learning where  I used to get stuck is sth. Even internet doesn't have answer to most of questions that books don't have...People in internet just read few lines of books and give answers lol..Most reference wikipedias and RFCs when I ask questions. and as i ask question it helps me realize that i already know everything and i am just confused lol...when i see answers in stackexchange, reddit and other forums, they are just repeating what i already know. but it does help me , sth better than nth. i won't be the same student, if i had no access to these ~200 forums including  reddit.





And I forgot to mention, I don't fcking understand most of wikipedia, documentation, RFCs and first hand information about a technology. I need a fcking book to understand it.



And fck coursera, wtf do they teach? Their videos have literally no depth. it is like someone teaching their self made notes for memorization to students not someone teaching concepts so that other understand it. it is garbage(totally my pov, it might be great for many).

QUESTIONS-:

0) Why do you think I don't understand stuffs from these courses(majority I don't understand)?
 
1) so please tell me what should i do to GET RID OF MY DUMBNESS? WHAT PRACTICES SHOULD I DO?

2) I want to become  a superhuman. How do I become. By superhuman I don't mean that becoming batman or superman or spiderman. What  I mean is achieving stuffs that I am unable to achieve at the moment IN THE FIELD OF LEARNING. one thing that used to make me a superhuman was waking up at 3 AM but now i don't have enough willpower for it. I used to finish all my day works by 10 AM and my day used to be lovely. morning focus gave me extra brain cells that helped me to understand concepts far easily.",understand thing teach mit nptel

I have received admit for Master's in Mechatronics from a German university (TH Rosenheim). I would like to know what should I study so that I don't get completely lost in electronics' section of syllabus.

The reason I chose mechatronics is mechanical engineering programs have obsolete syllabus and mechatronics seems to be more future oriented. I will select subjects such as 'real time systems' , 'solid state electronics' , 'wireless communication systems' etc.

Classes start from 3rd October so I have approximately 3 months to prepare myself.

2403,Is there any sort of epigenetic/other biological marker for virginity that changes after first sexual intercourse?,"In considering the idea of ""virginity"" as a social construct rather than any physical phenomenon, I'm wondering whether there is *any* truth to the pervasive ideas surrounding female virginity. Sadly, because a lot of sex education fails to expose the narrative of the hymen demonstrating virginity/nonvirginity as false, it is a foundational aspect of the social expectations placed on women and their sexuality. This perspective focuses on the idea that there *must* be some way to prove whether a female has had sex before - because otherwise, how would be able to assess her worth as a woman?

When I expressed that there is no known physical or biological change that occurs after first sexual intercourse, therefore virginity is nothing more than a social construct, a colleague/friend of mine said she was under the impression that there was some biological change that occurred, alluding to epigenetics. She didn't have any science to back her claim, and at the moment I can't find any articles that support that claim either. 

Can anybody speak to the truth of this matter? many thanks in advance.",sort epigeneticother biological marker virginity change sexual intercourse consider idea virginity social construct physical phenomenon wonder truth pervasive idea surround female virginity sadly lot sex education fail expose narrative hyman demonstrate virginitynonvirginity false foundational aspect social expectation place woman sexuality perspective focus idea way prove female sex    able assess worth woman express known physical biological change occur sexual intercourse virginity social construct colleaguefriend impression biological change occur allude epigenetic science claim moment find article support claim anybody speak truth matter thank advance,0.1191485851825843,0.880851414817413,AskScience,AskScience

2405,"AskScience AMA Series: Hi, Reddit! I'm a critical care-related researcher, professor of medicine and doctor in the ICU. AMA about wellness, burnout and PTSD in healthcare professionals!","Hello, Redditors! My name is Marc Moss, and for the last 20 years, I have been studying the effects of stress on critical care nurses and other healthcare professionals.

I'm also a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Head of the Division of Pulmonary Sciences and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and work as a critical care doctor.

Earlier this year, my colleague Dr. Meredith Mealer and I were honored to receive the American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACN) Pioneering Spirit Award for our work studying the effects of stress on nurses and creating interventions to increase resilience among healthcare workers.

Among these interventions includes work at the [Colorado Resiliency Arts Lab](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/coral/our-team), a research consortium supported by the National Endowment for the Arts. We are striving to create a vibrant, collaborative creative arts therapy community that is committed to enhancing healthcare professional well-being and alleviating psychological stress in the workplace and
beyond.

While I've been studying healthcare-related burnout for many years, this last year and a half during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a war zone for our healthcare professionals. I have never been prouder of all of my colleagues and the amazing hospital employees that we work with on a daily basis. They are working long hours in difficult conditions, putting on and taking off protective equipment, while trying not to get sick themselves, or infect their families and children. You would be honored to witness their extraordinary and relentless efforts to care for our sickest patients. However the relentless stress is taking its toll on all of us. I am afraid that the next wave will ""break our souls"".

In addition to critical care-related research, my research interests include identifying new treatment modalities for patients with the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and exploring the diagnosis and treatment of neuromuscular dysfunction in critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation.

2410,Converting PNP sensor output to NPN.,"I have a light gate that I need to install on a conveyor belt, but the light gate is PNP output, and the I/O module for the PLC accepts NPN inputs. I don't have the budget on this project to buy a new sensor, so I have to make this one work.

The concept is easy enough, instead of shorting to ground, AKA ""sinking"", this sensor shorts to 24v+, or ""sourcing"". I've looked at several converters online, but none of them have published instruction manuals, so I can't be sure any of them will work with my project.

My sensor has three wires:

Brown: 24v+

Blue: 0v

Black: 24v Load

&amp;#x200B;

My I/O block has three terminals per input:

24v+

0v

0v Load

[This](https://www.amazon.com/signal-converter-MRI-24TR-Converter-Conversion/dp/B07P9R91TD) converter is claimed to convert PNP&gt;NPN, or NPN&gt;PNP depending on how it's wired, but I don't understand which wires would connect to which terminals. I don't know enough about transistors to understand the circuit diagrammed on the device, I only know that they can work as switches/relays.

Does anyone know how to attach all six wires to this thing? And would it actually work?

Is this unit simply defective?

Is there a better solution to this problem than these cheap undocumented Amazon products?

Could I just use the PNP sensor to power a relay that shorts the I/O block's ""0v Load"" to its own ""0v"" terminal? Or would that toast the I/O block?

2412,"I'm brainstorming, researching, and extending ideas for a true full duplex satellite internet network. It'll be 500-600 km away from Earth and covers everywhere including the poles. It extends my previous post. What're your answers and feedback based on my technical questions?","I'm an avid problem solver. I brainstormed ideas for solutions since I was 10 years old. I self teach myself.

**The purposes of my idea are to:**

1. Enable multi gigabit per second internet in a unit that can be carried in a backpacking backpack without significant weight or size.
2. Cover 100% of the Earth including the poles.
3. Enable any valid use that comes to mind. Examples include internet access in a dense jungle, automated or manually triggered emergency alert systems, bringing access to indigenous populations in remote areas that need small air taxis for access (especially Alaska), internet for long distance transportation, low cost backup for terrestrial access, etc.
4. Reduce or eliminate the awkward line of sight challenge. It'll be especially useful for transportation (vehicles go under bridges at times), and quickly deploying in a dense forest.
5. Have high speed even on a rainy day in a dense forest.
6. Have low latency and high transfer rates.

**The ideas include for this challenge include:**

1. Using physical antenna designs combined with self interference canceling. I read a research paper (found with a Google Scholar search) about combining existing ideas for full duplex wireless with both analog and digital self interference canceling. In other words, the problem is addressed before and after taking the radio waves and converting back into 1s and 0s.
2. Use at least 100 MHz of spectrum. More is better if possible.
3. Instead of the Ka band, this will use the L band and/or the S band.
4. Allow high order QAM levels that the client can always lower if a high level is not needed.
5. Use established functions like spot beam, intersatellite links, packet switch relay on the satellite constellation, etc.
6. Allow third party companies wanting to use this satellite network without deploying their own from scratch to do so.
7. With or without this satellite service selling service to end clients (internet users), ground terminals will remain neutral by connecting to all available peering providers.
8. First party client devices can use different operators that use these satellites. Useful for allowing newer and innovative business models. It's like how terrestrial carriers often allow Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) to use their networks.
9. Third party operators can collaborate for proprietary devices for their uses (like automated emergency alert systems for vehicle collisions). This is also to enable innovative solutions.

**Questions:**

1. From a physics perspective (simple terms and industry terms), how would an ASIC system for digital based self interference cancelling function lower the electricity demand for this? The only thing I can imagine is that it strips out unneeded functions to lower physical distance electrons must travel (it sounds similar to shrinking node size for CPUs in which the physical distance is reduced to move electrons from point to point in less time for calculations)?
2. I know that with refraction based optics for cameras, uneven changes in velocity (speed and direction) of visible light causes problems. With radio waves, would using a the L band and/or S band reduce the problem with refraction caused by stormy weather?
3. Would using high level QAM (at least 256 QAM) raise the need for line of sight alignment of client antennas (simple terms and industry terms)?
4. When allowing third party companies to sell services direct to client, would it be a good idea for there to also have sell service direct to end clients? It's like a semiconductor foundry either fabricating for its use and others while some like TSMC only fabricate for clients to reduce conflict of interests. Why or why not?
5. What other things should I know (like challenges with this idea)?

2413,What is the current theory of dark energy?,"I'm about to finish my semester of Intro to Astronomy and I thought it was weird how vague the section covering dark energy is. I get it this is just an intro class but they make it seem much more mysterious than I thought it was. I am by no means an expert I would like to think of myself as an enthusiast though. 

I tried to do some research and there were a lot of articles from 5 or more years ago. I thought I had a simple understanding of dark energy but I haven't seen it stated anywhere or explained recently. Is the explanation of dark energy still as elusive now as it was then?

My understanding is that in the beginning when the big bang happened, all of the forces of the universe were already present. Dark energy being a force driving matter away from other matter. Gravity being the force that pulls matter towards one another. With all of the matter in the universe being so close together after the big bang the expanding effect of dark energy was slowed due to gravity. Now fast forward to a much more spread out universe. Gravity has less of an effect because there is so much matter outside of each other's gravitational pull. This is what I thought explained the exponential expansion of the universe. The force of dark energy was always greater than gravity, but gravity had the upper hand when everything was closer together.

Alright so I know that is an extremely simplified version of things, I have always been interested in cosmology and try to keep current with what's going on. Where am I wrong? What am I confusing? Is there anything I'm completely off about?

2420,Does alcohol cause red blood cell agglutination?,"In the last two weeks, I've heard from two rather prominent Russian medical doctors (one is a surgeon, another is a coroner) the same story:

- alcohol in blood causes red blood cells to clamp together;

- these aggregates block capillaries;

- peripheral cells die from lack of oxygen;

- and this is how people who consume *any* alcohol get fat in the liver, fibrosis in the pancreas, and the brain just shrinks.

A lot was fishy in these claims, primarily the clear fact that these two guys seemed to be on a mission.  So, I checked PubMed and found practically nothing, but this may be because I am not good at searching there.

It does seem it boils down to this 1968 article, which likely served as the source of these claims:

&gt;Moskow, H. A., R. C. Pennington, and M. H. Knisely. ""Alcohol, Sludge, and Hypoxic Areas of Nervous System, Liver and Heart,"" Microvasc. Res 1968; 1:174-185

&gt;In 30 adult humans (13 females, 17 males) microscopic observations were made of blood flow and the conditions of the small vessels in the conjunctiva, and at the same time a blood sample was taken for determination of blood ethyl alcohol concentration. Ethanol concentrations ranged from zero to 328 mg/100 ml. With increasing concentrations of alcohol in the blood, the size of aggregated or agglutinated blood cell masses increased, and the forward rates of flow in small vessels decreased correspondingly.

http://www.arhiv.tvereza.info/science/papers/mosk68a.pdf

Yet (and this is the only thing you get on PubMed or even Google when you search for ""blood cell agglutination alcohol""):

&gt;J Neurol Sci. 1986 Jan;72(1):43-8.

&gt;Does alcohol-induced blood cell agglutination cause brain damage?

&gt;Phillips SC.

&gt;After 3 weeks of alcohol intoxication, the brains of rats were searched with light- and electron microscopy for degenerating nervous tissue and agglutination of erythrocytes in the blood vessels. There was no sign of degeneration of nerve cells or synapses in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, midbrain or hindbrain. No histological sections showed blood vessels with erythrocytes inside them. It is concluded that the agglutination of red blood cells seen in the conjunctivae of intoxicated human alcoholics is not necessarily an indication that vascular congestion is also occurring in the brain of such patients, nor that this is the primary mechanism of alcohol-related brain damage.

&gt; During World War Two, BBC News was broadcast to Nazi occupied Europe. Each news programme opened with a live broadcast of Big Ben tolling the hour - the magical sound of freedom.
&gt; Ingenious German physicists found a way to determine the weather conditions in London based on the tiny differences in the tone of the broadcast ding-dongs. This information offered invaluable help to the Luftwaffe. When the British Secret Service discovered this, they replaced the live broadcast with a set of recordings of the famous clock.

I couldn't find a source for this information except a [WW2 Forum that is discussing the same book](https://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=227687) and [a reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/47ozwz/til_during_wwii_the_live_broadcast_of_big_bens/) that links to a podcast.

2437,Has anyone found a way to succeed in change resistant environments?,"I started a new job last year working for a positive displacement pump designer/manufacturer. The systems are extremely antiquated, no proper PDM, all of the software is homebrew, and the cad software is from like 2007. Regardless they are a big player and the people I work with are absurdly intelligent. It’s a place I saw opportunity in because there’s got to be around 120 years experience within the engineering team. Great people.

In the beginning, I was basically running cad and processing drawing changes as usual. Everything was super old and the buggy software was written many years ago by old employees. In other words, there’s no manuals and the learning curve was steep. Imagine taking 2 days to process an ECN/ECO fighting error messages and checking in drawings. I remember on my first day one of the engineers mentioned a guy quit his first week because of the crappy software.

During this time, there was a slow period and I took it upon myself to do drawing reviews since many of them had improper/no GD&amp;T and it familiarized myself with the super diverse product set. There’s 10k+ drawings and it was a great to get accustomed to the design methodologies used.

At one point I found a large set of drawings with no datum’s and very incorrect GD&amp;T. I proceeded to update the drawings correctly over the course of a few days and submitted them for review. The senior engineers scolded me because the guys on the shop floor and suppliers get confused by positional tolerances. I was really taken back because…. I mean really? The old drawing called out 4 datum’s that weren’t located anywhere on the drawing.

It got worse to where any attempt I made to better a piece of software, improve functionality of our cad, write a manual to use some of the software was met with intense resistance. So much so that I just gave up. What really set me off was the 0.5% raise I received for the year. What a fucking insult.

I’ve now sat at my desk with 0 work for over 3 months. I even asked for work from my boss on a meeting about our project status updates and was met with “well we don’t have anything for you right now, I’ll get you something when we can” that was 4 weeks ago. It’s like I’m not trusted to do any senior engineering work, but given 0 opportunity to learn or grow. I hate to leave because the people I work with are great.

But based on some cursory research, it seems like APD is more behavioral; if a person does anti-social things, he has anti-social personality disorder.

2470,Got headhunted and was told I’m not a productive employee?? (Civil engineering),"Yesterday afternoon around 3.30 pm (this is important later) I got a call from some random number. I work from home Tuesdays and Thursdays and do site visit on Fridays as needed. Thinking it was one of the contractors I’m working with, I picked it up. Turned out it was an HR from a pretty big engineering consultant company. Started chit chatting about my current position and my salary etc. And later he told me the actual reason as to why he called. 

So my current task is to do scheduling, write SWPPPs, and EHASP documents. Apparently, the local DOT that they’re submitting their documents to (specifically SWPPPs and EHASP) keep on rejecting their submittals. The reviewer mentioned my name specifically as someone who has good track records on getting things approved. The HR basically called me asking me if I’m interested talking with the managers about working with them. 

Now, I’m a mom of a toddler plus I’m pregnant. More money will definitely be great but flexibility is what’s most important to me until the kids are older. Plus I’m not even the breadwinner for our family. So I asked him before we do that, what’s the day to day look like for someone who’s in my position. He started off saying well we expect our workers to work hard and play hard, minimum 50 hours work week. And right away I told him my typical day. 

My boss gave me assignments and the projects are hard money (not billed hourly but per projects). Obviously each project has a maximum amount of hours expected but I work efficiently that I never needed the full hours. For example, for SWPPP I’m expected to complete it in 15 hours. I completed the original one within 6 hours then the revision one within 2 hours. My boss is very understanding with the fact that I’m a mom and doesn’t give me more work. He said why would I punish someone for working effectively. So effectively I work 30-35 hours though of course there are 50-60 hours week (VERY rare). I told him the day I wfh my daughter is home with me and at 3.30 I’m done with my workday. 

The HR went off saying well that’s not very productive and your boss is wasting resources. So I told him well it’s not going to work out then. And  thanked him for the opportunity and hung up.

Idc about him lying a little, but in my opinion, OEE should not be used to compared two equipments, but to measure how much one equipment is used in reality (as opposed to how much we could use it).

2485,Is it worth it to take a role that you may not like 100% at a company you really like?,"I'm a controls engineer who's been in the manufacturing industry for almost 2 years now. I am in the process of interviewing for a role as a process engineer at a company I really like. 

Now in my industry process controls engineers work closely with process engineers. However, we do more of the programming side of the process (PLC logic, MES system configuration, etc.). Process engineers work more with the physical side of the process (valves, pumps, documentation, etc.) and they also tend to focus on one part of the plant. At my current job however, these two engineers work closely every day. Process engineers need to know the control system and how to read the programming in order to understand the process. Likewise, automation engineers benefit greatly if they know the process they are programming. 

This company I'm interviewing for is by far my #1 at the moment. There are several other companies in the area that i could work for, but none fit my requirements as closely as this one. Its got the perfect location, culture, work/life balance, etc. Its 5 minutes from where I currently live which is where I plan on staying for the next 5-10 years with my SO. I only hear good things from friends who work there. The other companies in the area that hire controls engineers are either further away (40+ minutes) or I have heard terrible things about their culture. 

 The only caveat is, I don't want to be a process engineer. When it comes to troubleshooting hands on mechanical components, I'm TERRIBLE with that stuff. I'm bad at it, I can't grasp it, and to be honest I don't want my career to go in that direction. When it comes to troubleshooting controllers, ladder logic, sequential function charts, etc however, I'm much better at it and I could see myself making a career out of this. Its what I'm good at and like to do, and its what I've been doing for the past 2 years.

This leads me to my question. When is it a good choice to sacrifice your career a little to work at what seems like a great company? My thought is, I can transition back to a controls engineer role within this new company in the next 1-2 years.

I already know I enjoy low voltage EE stuff because I went to electronic technician school in the army. I've also always been interested in computers/electronics since I was a kid(was the kid that always took stuff apart and didn't know how to put it back together).

Coding is alright, but I've never been that interested in it. It's really frustrating at times but can be rewarding if I get something to actually work.

&amp;#x200B;

I took architecture and CAD classes where I had to draft various parts like weird shaped blocks and parts of an engine block, but I hated it. Felt so tedious and boring. 

Remember I had to make a bridge out of toothpicks once and that was a real pain. Just thinking about working on roads and buildings for the rest of my life seems drab.

Although I did enjoy auto shop surprisingly and I even built my own motorcycle once in HS(albeit only going 20mpg top speed).

&amp;#x200B;

There's this thing called computer engineering at my local college that seems the most interesting to me considering I enjoyed working with electronics/computers a lot. But not sure if I should do that or just regular EE.

2507,"AskScience AMA Series: We're the researchers behind the ""faking a smile"" and drinking study, ask us anything!","We're industrial/organizational psychologists whose recent study on emotional labor and drinking gained [some traction on /r/science](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/bbe8ir/employees_who_force_themselves_to_smile_and_be/). We're here to answer your questions about controlling emotions at work, its effects on health and productivity, or what the heck an industrial/organizational psychologist is, anyway.

First, some basics. Industrial/Organizational psychology is the scientific study of people at work. Topics range from how to fairly select and place the best applicants, evaluate training programs, and measure job performance; to how to lead effectively, work in teams, motivate employees, and improve their health. It also just so happens to be one of the best jobs in science, according to [U.S. News and World Report](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/best-science-jobs) (not that we're bragging or anything...).

Our line of research, which focuses on emotional labor, ties in aspects of employee motivation, performance, and health. Similar to how we think of jobs requiring physical or mental labor, emotional labor refers to controlling your emotions to be in line with how your job expects you to feel - like how restaurant servers, nurses, cashiers, teachers, bartenders are expected to be kind, friendly, or service-oriented. We typically talk about emotional labor being done through two strategies:

+ **Surface acting** - faking or suppressing your emotional display to others
 + Faking a smile, holding back frustration towards a customer
+ **Deep acting** - bringing your true feelings in line with what the job requires
 + Thinking happy thoughts before a shift

There's been a ton of work looking at the effects of emotional labor since Arlie Hochschild
coined the concept in [1983](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520272941/the-managed-heart) - here's a [basic summary](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721418812771), as well as a more [in-depth review](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-04571-001).

In a national sample of U.S. workers, [our study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-11105-001) finds that *individuals who surface acted more tended to engage in more heavy drinking*. This relationship holds even after accounting for demographics (gender, age, education, income), employees' tendency to be in a bad mood, and the emotional demands of the job. We also found that employees who are more impulsive, have less control over their work, or have more short-term interactions (think cashier, compared to nurse or teacher) are especially at risk. We'll be on from 2-4 (ET, 18-20 UT) and we'd love to answer any questions you might have about our study, emotional labor more generally, or the study of people at work!

If prestige and ranking don't matter as much, what about job prospects? Are there universities where it's easier to get a well-paying job as a student there? If so, which ones are the best?

Lastly, what are your thoughts on going to a school less known for engineering so that there isn't as much competition? Would it offer me an advantage as a prospective engineering student to have peers that are less competitive? For example, maybe I could get into engineering extracurriculars more easily.

2520,Do other species have warfare?,"A deeper version of what I'm wondering is, does biological science have a definition for war? Does it have to involve weapons? Does it require tactics/formations to distinguish it from just brawling? I've seen footage of apes using sticks and rocks as weapons, and many species like baboons and wolfs have clans of up to 20 individuals go after each other in full numbers. Tree ants will go on conquests to take over another colony's territory and resources. (I'll leave video links for some of those examples) Basically, I'm looking for a definition for war that will tell me whether or not humans are the only species that actually do it.

2521,How to determine what size servo is needed? I'm just getting headaches.,"So, I've been Googling about torque, mass, and so forth. I have basically all of the data I think I need, but I am somehow failing to comprehend the information in a way that will allow me to determine what size servo I need.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to turn an hourglass with a total mass (including case) of 70g 180 degrees about once an hour. The hourglass is glass, but is contained within an acrylic cylinder 50mm in diameter and 132mm in height. As an hourglass, it's being rotated to essentially reset so the bulk of the mass at the time of movement will be contained at the lowest point of the object (if that matters and I think it does, but here's a place, for example, where I'm just not comprehending how to include this).

2526,Suggestions on pilot testing continuous flow wastewater treatment,"I've been tasked with designing a pilot test of a 55,000 liter photobioreactor for wastewater treatment with some kind of simulated continuous flow-through of wastewater (130 L/min wastewater goes in, clean(er) water comes out with only a small portion of sludge return to the inlet).  Problem is the site is not located at a wastewater source, so we will use synthetic wastewater, and it is not feasible to have enough influent/effluent storage for a true continuous run.

Currently our only idea is some kind of plug flow setup, where we inject known concentrations of nutrients/BOD and estimate the time it takes to reach the outlet to take effluent sample.  Meanwhile all of the water would be recirculated back to the inlet of the reactor to prevent the reactor from just draining out.  Obviously a big problem with this setup is how to differentiate dilution from actual treatment.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.",suggestion pilot testing continuous flow wastewater treatment task design pilot test    liter photobioreactor wastewater treatment kind simulated continuous flowthrough wastewater    lmin wastewater clean water come small portion sludge return inlet problem site locate wastewater source use synthetic wastewater feasible influenteffluent storage true continuous run currently idea kind plug flow setup inject know concentration nutrientsbod estimate time reach outlet effluent sample water recirculate inlet reactor prevent reactor drain obviously big problem setup differentiate dilution actual treatment suggestion appreciate,0.48887594638881365,0.5111240536111853,AskScience,AskEngineers

2529,AskScience Meta Thread: COVID-19 and reaching people in a time of uncertainty,"Hello everyone! We thought it was time for a meta post to connect with our community. We have two topics we'd like to cover today. Please grab a mug of tea and pull up a comfy chair so we can have a chat.

---

**COVID-19**

First, we wanted to talk about COVID-19. The mod team and all of our expert panelists have been working overtime to address as many of your questions as we possibly can. People are understandably scared, and we are grateful that you view us as a trusted source of information right now. We are doing everything we can to offer information that is timely and accurate. 

With that said, there are some limits to what we can do. There are a lot of unknowns surrounding this virus and the disease it causes. Our policy has always been to rely on peer-reviewed science wherever possible, and an emerging infectious disease obviously presents some major challenges. Many of the questions we receive have been excellent, but the answers to them simply aren't known at this time. As always, we will not speculate. 

We are also limiting the number of similar questions that appear on the subreddit. Our panelists are working hard to offer in-depth responses, so we are referring people to similar posts when applicable. 

To help, we have compiled a few /r/AskScience resources:

- [The COVID-19 FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/medicine/2019-ncov): This is part of our larger FAQ that has posts about a multitude of topics. We are doing our best to update this frequently.

- [COVID-19 megathread 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ewwmem/have_a_question_about_the_2019_novel_coronavirus/) and [COVID-19 megathread 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/etkdx1/coronavirus_megathread/): Lots of questions and answers in these threads.

- [New COVID-19 post flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=flair%3A%27covid-19%27&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on): We've added a new flair category just for COVID-19. You can filter on this to view only posts related to this topic. We are currently re-categorizing past posts to add to this. 

- We will continue to bring you new megathreads and AMAs as we can.

Of course, all this comes with the caveat that this situation is changing rapidly. Your safety is of the utmost importance, and we'd like to remind you not to take medical advice from the internet. Rely on trusted sources like the WHO and CDC, check in with your local health department regularly, and please follow any advice you may receive from your own doctor.

**AskScience AMAs**

Second, we wanted to discuss our AMA series a bit. As you know, many schools have either cancelled classes or moved to online learning. This presents a unique set of challenges for students and teachers alike. Many of our expert panelists also teach, and they are working extremely hard to move their courses online very quickly.

We are putting out a call for increased AMAs, with the goal of giving as many students as possible the opportunity to interact directly with people who work in STEM fields. This goes for all disciplines, not just those related to COVID-19. We typically host scientists, but we have also had outstanding AMAs from science authors and journalists. 

As always, we plan only schedule one AMA per day, but we will be making an effort to host them more frequently. To aid in this process, we've [created a website for interested parties to use to contact us]( https://sites.google.com/view/askscienceamas/). 

We schedule AMAs well in advance, so don't hesitate to contact us now to set something up down the line. If you'd like to do an AMA with your research team, that's great, too (group AMAs are *awesome*).
If you're a student or science educator, please keep an eye on the calendar in the sidebar! As always, feel free to reach out to us via modmail with questions or comments.

To kick things off, we'd like to cordially invite to join us for an **AMA with author Richard Preston on March 17**. He is the author of a number of narrative nonfiction books, including *The Hot Zone*, *The Demon in the Freezer*, and *Crisis in the Red Zone*.

2535,Attempting to switch from engineering to quantitative programming jobs,"Background: I worked as an engineer for 3 years after getting my MS in physics. I did experimental optics in graduate school and did similar stuff in my job. This required me to do a lot of hands on work designing experiments, building experiments, and taking data. I also have done a lot of coding in Matlab to model optical systems and analyze the data I took, as well as LabVIEW programming for automating experiments. 

Now, I just quit my job recently and have no desire to work with hardware again. My partner got a job in another city which pays extremely well, allowing me to not work for a while. I would like to use this time to figure out how to get into a different career: something like data science or some other quantitative field.

 I feel like the BS + MS in physics will help with this and the data analysis experience/coding experience will help too. I'm worried about getting my foot in the door though -- my background is more heavily experimental and while I did a lot of coding/analysis in Matlab, that isn't enough. I'm spending a lot of time learning Python now, and will be reviewing some of the statistical methods used in some of the roles I am interested in. 

So my question is this: What should I do to get my foot in the door for fields like data science and other quantitative programming jobs? Would it be enough to be self-taught and post some projects on a website? Or should I consider going back to school and getting an MS in data science or statistics?",attempt switch engineering quantitative programming job background work engineer    year ms physics experimental optic graduate school similar stuff job require lot hand work design experiment build experiment datum lot code matlab model optical system analyze datum labview programming automate experiment quit job recently desire work hardware partner job city pay extremely allow work like use time figure different career like datum science quantitative field feel like bs    ms physics help datum analysis experiencecode experience help worried foot door    background heavily experimental lot codinganalysis matlab spend lot time learn python review statistical method use role interested question foot door field like datum science quantitative programming job selftaught post project website consider school ms datum science statistic,0.9959214176585138,0.004078582341480406,AskEngineers,AskEngineers
