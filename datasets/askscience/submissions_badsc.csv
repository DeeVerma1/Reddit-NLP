R1: Who is William Bay? What is his registration? I tried to search for the doctor's name and I only found a person that made an outburst during Australian Medical Association meeting with a bizarre anti-vax tirade.

William Bay claimed that vaccine has side effects of: ""chest pain"", ""inability to walk"", and ""ejacuating blood"". The problem is that his claim is based on a mere anecdote, he didn't actually do research on the likelihood or even correlation.

The thing is, a tirade does not prove that vaccine mandate is bad. A study shows that vaccine is effective at stopping vaccine, and when there is a side effect, it's relatively harmless, and the harmful side effects are rare.

&gt;Dr. Dean Hamer is a researcher often cited to show that there is empirical data supporting the notion of genetic determinism in regards to homosexuality. News organizations like National Public Radio and Newsweek have done news stories regarding his work.[1] In respect to the press trumpeting various findings genetics-of-behavior research uncritically the science journal Science stated the following in 1994:

&gt;&gt;“Time and time again, scientists have claimed that particular genes or chromosomal regions are associated with behavioral traits, only to withdraw their findings when they were not replicated. ""Unfortunately,"" says Yale's [Dr. Joel] Gelernter, ""it's hard to come up with many"" findings linking specific genes to complex human behaviors that have been replicated. ""...All were announced with great fanfare; all were greeted unskeptically in the popular press; all are now in disrepute.""[2]	”

&gt;Martin A. Silverman, M.D. wrote regarding a famous study of Dr. Dean Hamer:

&gt;&gt;“On July 16, 1993, it was reported in Science (pp. 291, 321) that geneticist Dean Hamer and his team at the National Cancer Institute had reported on a study involving 40 pairs of brothers both of whom were gay that had led them to conclude that they had discovered a factor on the X chromosome through which gayness was genetically transmitted to them from their mothers. This was hailed as proof that homosexuality in men is biological in origin. Two years later, however, Eliot Marshall reported in Science (June 30, 1995, p.268) George Ebers and George Rice of the University of Western Ontario had unsuccessfully attempted to replicate Hamer's findings and had ""found no evidence that gayness is passed from mother to son"" genetically. He also reported that the Office of Research Integrity in the Department of Health and Human Services was investigating Hamer's work.[3]	”

Kind of funny that if we think of numbers (odds, evens) as a wavelength around 0 setting, we see math get alot easier. 

Its as if all you needed to do was add a plus one to stop generation, when seen as fractions.

&gt;I will gladly concede the fact that attempts to “cure” homosexuality have only ended in failure, and more emotional and mental distress for the patients involved. That’s not because I consider homosexuality to be innate or inborn. It’s entirely possible to doubt that gays are “born that way” and to oppose conversion therapy at the same time.

&gt;Hell, the mere fact that a huge percentage of zoomers, as high as 40% of them, identify as LGBTQ, casts reasonable doubt on the meme. If homosexuality were truly 100% inborn or genetic, it would be impossible for homosexuals to make up more than a very, VERY small fraction of the population, since homosexuals and transgender people have a snowball’s chance in hell to pass their genes to the next generation.

First off the percentage is at [20%](https://www.axios.com/lgbtq-generation-z-gallup-24551003-3bfa-414a-bbef-ff663368c4b5.html). And that is because:
&gt;&gt;""The kids are growing up now ... in a very different environment,"" he said, adding that LGBTQ young adults are ""much more likely because of their environment to acknowledge that and to accept that compared to people in the past who were in a similar situation.""

Second there are plenty of reasons to believe that it is [biological](https://theconversation.com/stop-calling-it-a-choice-biological-factors-drive-homosexuality-122764)

&gt;I digress, but the point is, if the culture tells children that it’s cool to be a sodomite, they will take it to heart. They seldom have the cognitive ability to withstand that propaganda on their own. If sexual orientation were truly inborn or innate, this would be extremely harmful, probably even more so than forcing heterosexuality on adolescents who are clearly gay. They’re essentially persecuting those who carry society, carry the human population. Just because they’re jealous and angry at them. And said kids are only identifying as LGBTQ because it’s the cool thing to do, NOT because they actually are sexually attracted to the same sex or because of persistent gender-confusion.

&gt;1. They sexually identify as hermaphrodites, eunuchs, or intersex (despite not actually being intersex)

&gt;Basically, they’ve looked at too much weird futa hentai and decided that it was really fucking hot to be both a guy and a girl at the same time, or neither. Even though few “nonbinary” people are willing to admit this, there may be some truth to this.

&gt;Come the fuck on, what else would “nonbinary” mean? Even if you accept the premise that gender and sex are separate, does it make even the slightest amount of sense for genders to be based off of sexes that don’t even exist?

&gt;Sex itself isn’t on a spectrum. Not even “intersex” is proof that sex is on a spectrum, since all intersex people are either male or female, with no middle ground. There is no middle ground between “sperm” and “egg”, or people who can produce both. There are no true hermaphrodites that exist in the world today, and despite the efforts made by trans activists to confuse trans issues with intersex issues, they are completely separate things. Intersex is a genetic disorder that causes physical deformities and severe health problems, and it’s even gotten to the point that many intersex people find themselves telling TRAs to knock it off.

Only if you choose to ignore [the brain](https://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2015to2019/2016-transsexualism.html)

&gt;So either nonbinary people identify as something that was inspired by their favorite porno, or they identify as intersex, which when you really think about it, is nothing more than another instance of “bodily integrity identity disorder,” or “transableism”.

Today (4/20/2022) The Associated Press [published an article](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-health-europe-accidents-edcd5bc0e6bde3cbf6d7300bebc9343f) apparently trying to warn their audience about the dangers which may happen as a result of the Russian military limiting backup supplies to the decommissioned Chernobyl reactor. Instead, they flagrantly spread misinformation, repeat debunked claims by politicians and self-described experts, and perpetuate the irrational fear of nuclear power. Let's take a quick look.

&gt; Workers kept the Russians from the most dangerous areas, but in what Semenov called the worst situation he has seen in his 30 years at Chernobyl, the plant was without electricity, relying on diesel generators to support the critical work of circulating water for cooling the spent fuel rods.

This is our first indication that the science here may be off. First, [we've known that the power supplies have been disconnected for over a month now.](https://metro.co.uk/2022/03/09/ukraine-war-chernobyl-nuclear-plant-suffers-blackout-16244059/?ito=socialmetrouktwitter) It’s really important to point out that the IAEA have said there is [‘no critical impact on safety’.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/chernobyl-power-supply-cut-completely-after-russian-seizure-warns-ukaine?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other) This is an inconvenience, but not a safety issue, unlike the [disinformation that Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba announced at the time.](https://twitter.com/DmytroKuleba/status/1501531157510426625) 

Second, the framing used by AP is extremely misleading, dangerously so. There are three generators connected to the plant, where only one has been reportedly disabled. In addition to that, the diesel generators can last seven days each by themselves, which does not put the plant under any sort of immediate concern. If power was lost to the generators, it would only remove their remote monitoring systems, which would just require workers to check on the waste storage facilities locally.

Third, the AP is providing direct disinformation. Unlike what is announced here, [the fuel rods do not need to be actively cooled. If all cooling was somehow lost the fuel would not boil off, as seen from this report from ENSREG.](https://www.ensreg.eu/sites/default/files/National%20Report%20of%20Ukraine.pdf) (PDF warning) 

At this point we reach our first bit of actual insanity, this claim from former Greens group president Rebecca Harms. 

&gt;Russia’s invasion marks the first time that occupying a nuclear plant was part of a nation’s war strategy, said Rebecca Harms, former president of the Greens group in the European Parliament, who has visited Chernobyl several times. She called it a “nightmare” scenario in which “every nuclear plant can be used like a pre-installed nuclear bomb.”

I don't know how exactly to provide my thoughts on this in the most civilized manner, but I'll give it a college try. This is one of the worst takes I've seen from a politician in recent memory. The news media has spent an entire month panicking about Russia taking over Ukrainian nuclear power plants or shooting it with missiles and causing an explosion, including, unfortunately, [more misinformation from Ukraine about the dangers of Zaporizhzhia](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/explainer-dangerous-russias-nuclear-plant-strike-83248294) From that, we should have learned, or at least gained a decent understanding of, WHY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS CANNOT EXPLODE LIKE A BOMB. 
* Modern nuclear reactors have dozens of failsafes to stop any kind of failure. If power is cut (Loss of Offsite Power (LOOP), the SCRAM sequence initiates automatically and the rods are dropped into the reactor's core and kills the reaction.
* It is scientifically impossible for a reactor to explode like a nuclear bomb. There are many of reasons for this, but one of the easiest to explain is that [the fuel is not compact enough to create a chain reaction.](https://nrl.mit.edu/about/faq) 

Finally, addressing the irrational fear that Chernobyl could be ransacked to create a dirty bomb, which she may be alluding to if you give her the benefit of the doubt:
* [Using nuclear material from a power plant is less optimal than stealing it from a hospital,](https://archive.ph/TQRXv) let alone from a nation that already procures its own nuclear weapons.

The story then begins to talk about the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, which is for the most part very well written and researched, but has almost nothing to do with the topic at hand besides restating how dangerous it is that Russian soldiers are digging trenches in radiated soil and kicking up radiated dust with their vehicles. It finishes with a recap of the actions that the Russian troops have done in Chernobyl, all of which has been covered previously on other outlets and none of which has anything to do with the main topic of their article. 

Overall, this is a poor piece by AP which only serves to mislead the public about the dangers of nuclear power while also causing unnecessary panic which can obscure real issues happening with the Russian invasion of Ukraine in exchange for doomscrolling clicks. A disappointing lack of scientific research and overreliance on irreputable individuals make this an easy example of bad science.",True,False,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,30233.0,public,self,Debunking the dangers of nuclear energy - Associated Press,0.0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/u81buk/debunking_the_dangers_of_nuclear_energy/,,all_ads,6.0,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'bg5ilJ-7Py6Lc-6qqLC628oeFZ0ycAMa5-0B4UuYknM', 'resolutions': [{'height': 87, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cInLDHPcbiXsnCnMMUGQiVzsikzjZkawvE-RmDTKIIA.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a13f98e66f34e94d88a2dd543767532c840cb24', 'width': 108}, {'height': 174, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cInLDHPcbiXsnCnMMUGQiVzsikzjZkawvE-RmDTKIIA.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=569ba2a990bbdabb2442d57ef0c03b0e9ba8ea60', 'width': 216}, {'height': 258, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cInLDHPcbiXsnCnMMUGQiVzsikzjZkawvE-RmDTKIIA.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0250fb56c87d9e38804f4e79d0b61d261bc57a05', 'width': 320}, {'height': 517, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cInLDHPcbiXsnCnMMUGQiVzsikzjZkawvE-RmDTKIIA.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8ae4e8d29c972449452ace195498808cec19f81', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 517, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cInLDHPcbiXsnCnMMUGQiVzsikzjZkawvE-RmDTKIIA.png?auto=webp&amp;s=5f1f6c80bcbf4112c560e2a9a0cfc005b613ca28', 'width': 640}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;If homosexuals are comparable to infertile heterosexuals, it is a disability. We don’t mistreat people for having disabilities, but we don’t pretend that it’s as ideal as being able-bodied, nor do we treat bodily integrity dysphoria as valid.

&gt;If homosexuality is comparable to straight people engaging in oral or anal sex, it is a fetish or paraphilia.

&gt;If homosexuality is comparable to friendships between those of the same sex, why do they have sex?

&gt;If homosexuality were as safe as heterosexuality, why are they disproportionately susceptible to STDs and cause physical damage to each others sphincters? Why is “bug chasing” a fetish? Why do the others not bat an eye at those who refuse to get tested, or continue to have sex even after testing positive? Why do they then sperg out at those who MIGHT spread COVID, an illness that is easier to survive AND not get permanently maimed by?

So far he is also conflating sexual attraction with sexual behavior...

&gt;If homosexuality is a valid form of romance, why does nature deny them reproduction? Why make children in a lab or with a surrogate? If homosexual love is as pure as heterosexual love, why are gays statistically unlikely to remain monogamous compared to heterosexuals?

&gt;If not being able to get married was a reason why homosexuals were so promiscuous before, why has it gotten worse since then, with the degenerate mainstream media becoming more emboldened in promoting lifestyles like polyamory and cuckoldry? 

Where are they promoting cuckoldry? Also don't bash [polyamory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-polyamorists-next-door/201806/myths-about-polyamory]

&gt;Why do so few express interest in actually getting married, or treating it like the strict, closed relationship it is supposed to be?
If homosexual parents were just as good as straight parents, [why do children of homosexual parents frequently face the same problems that those of single parents do](https://archive.ph/o/Wiu5e/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2500537)? Why would we knowingly place children in such an environment when there are many more stable heterosexual couples? Does the emotional gratification of gay people really matter that much that we’d deprive a child of a proper childhood in order to do it?

For one thing that study is [bunk](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/conservatives-seize-on-hugely-flawed-study-about-same-sex-parents-bd797734bf40/). The [actual science](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-wellbeing-of-children-with-gay-or-lesbian-parents/) shows something different.

&gt;Hell, the mere fact that a huge percentage of zoomers, as high as 40% of them, identify as LGBTQ, casts reasonable doubt on the meme. If homosexuality were truly 100% inborn or genetic, it would be impossible for homosexuals to make up more than a very, VERY small fraction of the population, since homosexuals and transgender people have a snowball’s chance in hell to pass their genes to the next generation.

Look up [epigentics](https://theconversation.com/stop-calling-it-a-choice-biological-factors-drive-homosexuality-122764) moron. 

&gt;What’s more, even troon activists and apologists are perfectly willing to openly dispense with the notion that sexual orientation is inborn or innate. They do it whenever they complain about lesbians or straight men who refuse to fuck trans “women.”

&gt;KOMPAS.com — Minuman berkarbonasi alias minuman bersoda selama ini sering dihindari karena dianggap kurang sehat. Padahal, minuman yang punya efek menyegarkan ini juga bisa membantu mengurangi tumpukan kristal asam urat.

Translation: Carbonated drinks are often viewed as an unhealthy drinks. However, these refreshing drinks can actually reduce the build-up of uric acid.

This source says otherwise: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18163396/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18163396/)

&gt;Serum uric acid levels increased with increasing sugar-sweetened soft drink intake. After adjusting for covariates, serum uric acid levels associated with sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption categories (&lt;0.5, 0.5-0.9, 1-3.9, and &gt;or=4 servings/day) were greater than those associated with no intake by 0.08, 0.15, 0.33, and 0.42 mg/dl, respectively (95% confidence interval 0.11, 0.73; P&lt;0.001 for trend). The multivariate odds ratios for hyperuricemia according to the corresponding sweetened soft drink consumption levels were 1.01, 1.34, 1.51, and 1.82, respectively (P=0.003 for trend). Diet soft drink consumption was not associated with serum uric acid levels or hyperuricemia (multivariate P&gt;0.13 for trend).

Now let's see how they rationalize this:

&gt;Menurut Prof Made Astawan, ahli gizi dan pangan dari Institut Pertanian Bogor, minuman bersoda bersifat basa sehingga reaksi dengan asam urat yang bersifat asam akan menghasilkan garam. Hal tersebut sesuai dengan prinsip kimia, senyawa basa dicampur dengan senyawa asam akan menjadi netral ditambah garam.

Translation: According to Prof Made Astawan, an expert of nutrition and food from Institut Pertanian Bogor, soda drinks are alkaline, so they will react with uric acid to form a salt. This is according to the principle of chemistry, where alkaline + acid = neutral + salt.

Prof Made Astawan needs to learn a concept named buffer solution, a weak acid + conjugate base mix that changes the PH very little when a small amount of acid or alkaline is added to the solution. This solution is present in blood in the form forms of carbonic acid and bicarbonate. This ensures that blood retained its preferred PH, and won't be affected by what foot we eat (to a certain extent). In fact acidosis sometimes actually means that something was wrong with your lungs, not your food. This is known as respiratory acidosis.

Also, soda is definitely acidic. From this source:

&gt;Sorry but no. If an mother smokes with AN CHILD she does NOT CHANGES THE ENTIRE GEEN POOL OF HER FUTURE HEIRS. It might harm the child and cause it many disfunctions, BUT THAT IS NOT GENE BASED you.

&gt;Sex is based on biological factors such as sex chromosomes and gonads whereas gender has a social component- So in short YOU ARE SAYING, THAT SMOKING CIGARATES CAN CHANGE YOUR SEX......GOOD GOOD. Just more moronity. Can I have more mother?

At the 2:00 minute mark, she talks about Quantum Entanglement.  “Instead of entangling QUBITs as we go, there is a lot to be gained by generating all of the entanglement at the beginning.” 

BUT, if you can create QUBIT entanglement “at the beginning”, that means all your QUBITs are in a Quantum State Superposition.  Quantum Entanglement depends on Quantum State Superposition! 

AND, if all of your QUBITs are entangled and in a superposition, then why would you need Quantum Error Correction in the first place?    It sounds like they already have a perfectly working Quantum Computer! 

So yes, there is a lot to gain by generation of the entanglement at the beginning!  It would mean they already solved all the problems with today’s Quantum Computers!  Woohoo... that's a contradiction for the either the Xanadu marketing or engineering team!

&amp;#x200B;

In the picture, you’ll see standard Quantum Mechanics definitions: 

1)  Entanglement is broken when the measurement is made. 

2)  The “superposition of the wavefunction” is also broken when a measurement is made.  (Or the Quantum State Superposition collapses).

From these definitions, you can see Quantum Entanglement requires that the Quantum States of a particle are in a superposition, which is described by the “wavefunction” math.

Okay, so first thing we got, we gotta send the Big Bang in both directions of time. No biggie, Turok &amp; Co got us covered:

https://physics.aps.org/articles/v11/s147

https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08928

but UH OH, big problem, in order to match up with Lambda CDM, per the article, the model needs to explain large scale smoothness and *it does not.*

okay so here's our bong hit revision, the symmetric big bang model describes T=0 as nothingness AFAIK, and T plus or minus any nonzero value of time and you got matter on one side, antimatter on the other. 

okay, so, instead, let's put T=0 as a 50/50 mixture of matter and antimatter, AKA more a state of pure energy that than a state of nothingness, and then we gotta get the matter and antimatter to split in time.

 Now I think the entire reason the model **doesnt** do this is to avoid matter and antimatter destroying itself into nothingness. Never fear, crackpot physics can save the day.

----

**Entering from* temporal stage right and stage left simultaneously, enter bong hit #2, a submission from a shitty journal, [CPT Symmetric Thermodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0205), which we will justify via a  reputable but obscure formalism of QM, [Vaidman's Two State Vector Formalism](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0105101)

Okay, the nonshit part first, let's justify some nonsense - it's really helpful to describe wavefunctions as evolving backwards and forwards in time simultaneously in explaining weak measurements. Now note figure 1 of Vaidman &amp; Co's paper - and the isolation of a rearward propagating wavefunction - we will get back to that. Now don't quote me on this, but my gut is telling me that allowing wavefunctions to propagate backwards may actually have distinguishable consequences from a mere ""interpretation"" of QM

----

Okay now the shit part, we take the Entropy article (again this is /r/badscience so im allowed to link them), which is basically maxing out the Feynman-Stueckelberg Interpretation to have macroscopic, entropic consequences. 

Per Vaidman, we can describe backwards wavefunctions, so we should be able to have backwards collapse/decoherence. The microphysical origin of macroscopic entropy lies in decoherence ([my man seth lloyd on decoherence as the source of entropy](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-entanglement-drives-the-arrow-of-time-scientists-say-20140416/))

----

Okay. So, back to the 50/50 mixture - we [bong hit] assign a *preferred temporal tendency of wavefunction propagation to matter and antimatter* (the 'time primer' in the thermo paper), ergo our Big Bang's T=0 conditions split in two directions of timr as the only way to increase entropy, **and** our T=0 conditions have inflation-like conditions - a homogenous mixture of matter and antimatter could not gravitationally collapse (such a thing produces a major change in entropy, but if matter and antimatter are ""looking at time"" in opposing matters, they mutually resist in the timeless, eternal T=0 condition). See section 3.2.2. of Klimenko&amp;Co's Thermodynamics paper for this description of said mixture of matter and antimatter 

---

We don't ever violate the second law, nor causality, as anything we observe is by definition ""along for our temporal ride"" - at *most*, you *may* be able to produce behavior of isolated antimatter systems which appear to violate the second law, but (1) the entropy of the experiment as a whole will still increase over time and (2) the isolation of the system prevents information from travelling backwards, you'd only know something weird happened after you 'open the quantum box' - no dead quantum grandfathers (3) experiments with coherently isolated entangled antimatter, or isolated macroscopic lumps of antimatter, are still a few years out.

When this idea is combined with the Lorentz Transform math, it creates the clock paradox.  This paradox exists because Einstein's proof that ABSOLUTE TIME and SPACE are not needed failed.

This first image summarizes the first three sections of his 1905 paper.

**Section 1** \- This is basic *Distance = Rate \* Time* math that defines Einstein's Clock Synchronization process.  If the FORWARD *distance* is equal to the BACKWARD *distance*, then both *TIMES* will be equal because the *RATE* of lightspeed is constant.

Once these clocks are synchronized, an event occurring at CLOCK A that happens at 2:05 (for example) will be SIMULTANEOUS with an event at CLOCK B, if it also occurs at 2:05.  In other words, the Einstein Synchronized Clocks remove the lag time (or delay or latency) of the travel time (of light, in this case).

**Section 2** \- Point A and Point B in the moving system (or on the moving measuring rod) can not have their clocks synchronized.  Einstein's Clock Synchronization method always fails for the moving system because the FORWARD D=RT *is not equal* to the Backward D=RT, but the stationary system has its clocks synchronized successfully.

This means that two events (one occurring at Point A and another at Point B) will be simultaneous in the stationary system but will NEVER be simultaneous in the moving system!

**Section 3** \- Wait!  Now, the moving system has synchronized clocks!  This means that simultaneous events CAN occur in the moving system!  How is this possible?  What changed?

**Answer:**  The emitting light source was switched from the stationary system to the moving system!  

If Einstein's Clock Sync method is *RELATIVE TO THE EMITTING SOURCE*, then that is the definition of the Doppler Effect and NOT directly related to the coordinate system itself (like Einstein is attempting to convey)!  

Understand that the ""relativity"" math is really a special case of the Doppler Effect that was derived by Woldemar Voigt 18 years prior to Einstein's paper.  Unfortunately, neither Lorentz or Einstein cited Voigt's work, so that people would be more familiar with the origin of the ""relativity"" math transforms!

I'm just suspicious of someone throwing down a hefty amount of ""science"" in this certain way, that appears to me as this sort of ""I know you don't understand this, but trust me because of all these words.""

Bad Science for our purposes means news or articles or other sources which present established science incorrectly. It doesn't mean science is bad, or that mainstream science is incorrect.

New ideas need to be published, go through peer review, become established as science and then might be on-topic here if they are misrepresented.

So, do we want to have a rule five to ban these types of post? I am generally a hands-off mod as many of you will know.

&gt;The censorship continues. MedRxiv is a just preprint server - any papers within scope are normally automatically accepted... [[tweet](https://twitter.com/profnfenton/status/1454343830308798466)]

No they aren't, all papers submitted to medRxiv are screened (they need to do this to keep it from turning into [MedViXra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViXra)):

&gt;All manuscripts uploaded to medRxiv undergo a basic screening process for offensive and/or non-scientific content and for material that might pose a health risk. [[here](https://www.medrxiv.org/submit-a-manuscript)]

But anyway, let's look at the paper [[Tweet](https://twitter.com/profnfenton/status/1454348195425882113), [PDF](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~norman/papers/inconsistencies_vaccine.pdf)].

*Literally the first sentence of the introduction* shows that the methodology is totally wack:

&gt;In  a  previous  article  we  argued  that  the  overall  risk/benefit  of  vaccines  was  best  measured  by 
comparing  all-cause mortality  between the vaccinated  and  unvaccinated.  A simple  summary of  our 
arguments  for  this  is  provided  in  the  Appendix.

This is absurd. This is like claiming that listening to schlager music increases mortality because people who listen to schlager have higher mortality (ignoring the fact that schlager listeners are older than the average population). And to claim that comparing raw all-cause mortality is the *best* way to measure vaccine risk/benefit ratios is even more preposterous.

The rest of the introduction goes on to say that actually adjusting the all-cause mortality for age is also bad because reasons (I guess because the age adjusted numbers don't support the author's pre-chosen conclusion).

&gt;While  the  ASMR  [age standardized mortality rate] can  be  useful  in  many  epidemiological  and  medical  contexts, we  believe  it  is  both 
unnecessarily complex – and somewhat redundant – in this context.  The ASMR maps any population 
onto  a  notional  European  standard  age  population  profile,  and  its  calculation  depends  on  the 
population size and number of deaths in each of a full range of age stratification categories for each 
vaccination  category [Note: this is a really bad sentence].   The  fundamental  problem  we  noted  in  our  article  was  that  the  ONS  did  not 
provide this raw data and so it was therefore impossible to verify their ASMR calculations.  

&gt; If we had the raw age-categorized data we would be able to simply compare, for each age category 
and week, the all-cause mortality rate for vaccinated and unvaccinated. This would make the ASMR 
redundant and allow the direct comparison we seek.

Why do you want to directly compare the unadjusted death rates? Is it because more old people are vaccinated and they have a higher mortality rate and that supports your preferred conclusion? Surely not!

I think this already shows that the reason the paper was rejected is not because of 'censorship' but because the paper is shockingly bad methodologically.

The rest of the paper consists of statistical analysis on which I will not comment because I'm bad at stats (but it's based on a fundamentally flawed premise so it's worthless in any case)  and barely-concealed hand-wringing about government conspiracies and/or gross negligence.

I understand there is [some controversy](https://twitter.com/d_spiegel/status/1451565485150068736) regarding the population estimates used to estimate vaccine uptake in England but if you have to resort to methodology this terrible to get the result that the vaccines don't work then maybe, just maybe, they do.

**Bonus Round: Appendix**

&gt;Why all “all-cause mortality” is the most appropriate measure for overall risk-benefit analysis of 
Covid vaccines
 
&gt;* If Covid is as dangerous as claimed - and if the vaccine is as effective as claimed - we should 
by now have seen many more Covid related deaths among the unvaccinated than the 
vaccinated (in each age group).

Which we have.

&gt;* If the vaccine is as safe as claimed, then there should have been very few more deaths from 
causes unrelated to Covid among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated (in each age group).  
&gt;* So, the count of all-cause deaths should be higher among the unvaccinated than the 
vaccinated (in each age group), confirming that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the 
risks.

Except this comepletely ignores all other differences between those populations.
  
&gt;* Counting all-cause deaths completely bypasses the problem of defining what constitutes a 
‘Covid case’ or a ‘Covid related death’ (definitions which can be easily manipulated to fit 
different narratives).

It also completely bypasses the abovementioned possible differences between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated populations.
 
&gt;* We define a person as ‘vaccinated’ if they have received at least one dose. As we are not 
interested in whether a person becomes a ‘Covid case’, any other definition is flawed as it 
will fail to acknowledge that adverse reactions (including death) from vaccines often occur 
shortly after vaccination.  
&gt;* The fact that the US CDC (Centre for Disease Control) and other agencies now counts a 
person as ‘unvaccinated’ if they die within 14 days of the second dose, or after just one 
dose, might make some sense if we are interested only in the vaccine’s ability to stop 
infection. But in the context of death attribution, it makes no sense. 

If only there were data about adverse effects from vaccination! Oh wait, there are and there's no need to try to extract them from all-cause mortality which is an incredibly noisy signal.

The idea is to compare the behaviour of Twitter users who are pro- and anti-vaccine and the results claim that Trump ""was the main driver of vaccine misinformation on Twitter"" which is something I saw in the media and would have naively believed until I read this anti-scientific flawed-statistical work. 

Sadly, nobody who reported it seems to have read it either, I initially came across it on r/science earlier in the year ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/nvh304/antivaccination_profiles_on_twitter_tend_to_be/)) but only recently got around to reading it, there you can see most commenters also didn't read it, just comment on the results reported in a news article on it, the highest rated comment claims ""this is supported by network theory."" Unfortunately it is not supported by the shambolic network science in this paper (see Network Analysis section below). I will go through many of the flaws but do not have the time or patience to list them all!

**Methods**

The study attempts to compare Twitter users who support and oppose vaccines in response to COVID-19. To do this they take 50 users who used the hashtag #vaccineswork and 50 who use #vaccineskill and #vaccinesharm. They get a control group of 50 users by searching words from a random word generator and call this #control. 

Issues: Firstly, there are around 1 billion twitter users, choosing 50 is not a representative population, how are these chosen? Just the first 50 when they searched for that hashtag? A random selection of 50 who use that hashtag? Unknown as they don't describe this. Secondly, it seems like an issue that there are twice as many search terms for anti-vaccination users as vaccination users and it's not clear if they had to use both or one or the other. Thirdly, using a random word generator is a bad idea as not only could it just be nonsense, but you could also pick something related to the two topics. In order to even do this properly you should replicate it lots of times and take an average of your results, of course they don't do this...

**Results**

From this tiny sample they discover anti-vaccination users are more likely to retweet, pro-vaccination people are more likely to reply, something you can only claim about this sub-sample, not the population which is what they do. Next they ""quantified the number of conspiracy theory (CT)-associated contents  (tweets and retweets), as well as the number of emotional contents  (either depicting emotional situations or adopting emotional language) shared by control, anti-vaccination and pro-vaccination profiles."" How do they define emotional tweets? They don't other than what's in the parenthesis so it could be entirely subjective, and they don't mention it further in the supplementary material. So this is not described and as their sample is not properly described, this is entirely unreplicable.

They next look at the most common words used by each group and shockingly find: ""As expected, the word “vaccine(s)” was the most represented in both  groups, confirming that our initial criteria for inclusion were  reasonable."" No, this doesn't confirm your inclusion was reasonable, it confirms that searching for a hashtag with the string ""vaccine"" in it, did in fact find Tweets with the term ""vaccine"" in it. So Twitter's search is not broken is all this confirms. 

They next check whether use of emotional (still not clearly defined) language is related to increased engagement (sum of number of replies, likes and retweets per tweet) and produce this gem:

[If my first year undergrads showed me something like this I would not be happy!](https://preview.redd.it/vielotaizgu71.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4813b33ba78fddcfbb53c0650c5fa5072e6be4e3)

We see here that one single outlier drives a poor correlation on the right and from this they conclude that for the pro-vaccination users there is a ""significant correlation between the two aforementioned factors ([Fig 3D’](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247642#pone-0247642-g003)), suggesting that the use of emotional language could aid the success of the pro-vaccination communication strategy online."" There is unfortunately no way to believe this claim, again: emotional language is undefined, and one single outlier is driving this very low correlation. 

**Network Analysis**

They next look at the profiles being retweeted by 42 of the anti-vaccination and pro-vaccination users (not sure why this is reduced from 50), they choose the 10 most retweeted profiles (presumably of each user) and create a network. Technically this is a directed network, as just because they retweet someone does not mean that person even follows them, so the network measures chosen should reflect that (note: they don't), and obviously it's not complete as they choose only 10 profiles retweeted rather than all. Here is the network measures they show:

[Worst network measures figure ever?](https://preview.redd.it/d2o2ao1i4hu71.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34bc85d6edcf51acdb276e4003ec504407aa3af3)

No conclusions can be drawn from this, but let's go through it. Earlier they mentioned that anti-vaccine tweeters retweet more. They fail to mention here that most of their 42 users do not retweet 10 accounts, so the first quantity, number of neighbours is lower for those who retweet less, what does this mean? Pretty much nothing, that those who retweet less, retweet less, what do they claim it means: ""that anti-vaccination supporters are well-connected in a community"".  They also showed earlier that pro-vaccine users reply more, so why not look at the reply network too? What if that got opposite results that showed they're in a well connected community? Surely a reply network is more indicative of community than a retweet network? We have no idea, because they didn't bother to do it.

\[Further network measures: The second quantity here is the clustering coefficient, think of this quantity as follows, if there is a high clustering coefficient, for two people you know there is a high probability they know each other (this is related to the number of triangles in the network). As the scale is potentially log at this stage and the symbols are large these values are indecipherable (to be fair they do report them in the paper but this visualisation is terrible). As there are less links in the pro-vaccine people, they have a smaller clustering coefficient. This could just mean that pro-vaccine people retweet different people, more likely it means they have have a poor sample, which we know they do. The density is low, this means there is a small number of actual links compared to number of possible links (again meaningless -- the networks are sparse is what it means but that's usually the case). Finally they show the average path length, this tends to roughly scale with the log of network size which is what they show. So what does this whole section tell us? Basically nothing, they have networks that are slightly different and how not to represent network quantities.\]

They next introduce an edge cut-off (why? unknown) and show the most retweeted people in their biased sample of a network:

[Love D! Word cloud with one entry!](https://preview.redd.it/h96ci1u67hu71.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68146f252066420ba3ee8123be8a7f0e10c91e1a)

And here we see their conclusion, Trump is the cause of it all. The really infuriating thing here is, had they done the study properly they might have found this and it would be interesting (I think maybe someone else has since). But because they choose 42 (possibly random) users (from December 2020) with the hashtags #vaccinesharm and (or?) #vaccineskill, take their top 10 retweets, cut-off anyone with less than 5 connections, we have no idea if they just picked 42 Trump supporters, or if most anti-vaccination people out there in the world are actually influenced by Trump. Because they only look at retweets, and not followers or replies, we have no idea what the 42 pro-vaccine people are actually doing to properly compare.  Because they only chose one sample of 42 of each, we have no idea if this is a statistical anomaly or the norm. Due to their poor description of their data gathering and lack of description of terms, this is impossible to replicate. And due to their statistically insignificant samples, shambolic statistics and flawed network analysis, none of their conclusions can be taken seriously.

**How did this get published?**

So the obvious next question is, if this is so terrible, how did it get through peer review? People often have this notion of peer review being some gold standard in science but sadly, it's a bit of a lottery. PlosOne do however, give the option to show the peer reviews after and luckily, these guys accepted that, so you can read those [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/peerReview?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247642). Basically the first says ""put in the following references"" (the cynically minded might assume that some of those are papers by that reviewer to increase their citation count), and the second says ""Very interesting, you should replace all instances of 'President Trump' with 'former President Trump'"". And that's it! So clearly neither reviewer actually read it in any detail.

I blame the editor here too, they should look at it to know it's poor quality, PlosOne prides itself on aiming to have valid science even if this yields no results. This paper provides results with invalid science, the editor should quickly be able to identify this, and should be able to tell at least one reviewer did not read the paper.

The site even calls California the most anti-science state in the USA (citing, among other things, California universities inviting a speaker who has engaged in rhetoric like “farmers are rapists” and “fertilizer is WMDs”).

Beyond that it even questions the idea that science is currently progressing, suggesting that apart from a few flashy innovations like cell phones, scientific research has actually gone _backwards_ in the past few decades (using the argument that NASA could make it to the Moon in the 1960s but no longer has the capacity to do so now). For this, of course, it blames modern progressivism and politicization of science.

[This time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KqejmljxOY&amp;t=601s) she brings up ""Ghost Archaic Africans"" arguing that Sub-Saharans Africans, or West Africans who she refers to as ""Negroids"" are recent phenotypically speaking while at the same time are genetically diverged by haplotypes (Only A00 shows any evidence of this) from North Africans and other Eurasians due to archaic admixture.

Lets get into the various flaws, albeit perhaps not every single one.

First, lets address the significance of the title. It is a blatant reference to the terrible book by the same name addressed and debunked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/ik87n4/out_of_africa_not_debunked_richard_fuerle_and/). The thesis of this video is slightly different, as she is imprecise on what specimen characterizes ""Ghost Archaics"", Herectus or a post-erectus hominid such as represented by the Kabwe Skull? The issues regarding this will be explored forward.

She opens with a video clip and ""selective"" use of the Iwo Eleru skull. It is a skull that dates 10k-16k found in Nigeria associated with Late Stone Age technology. The significance of the skull is that it was found to be much earlier morphology, and would otherwise be classed with skulls dating to the Middle Stone Age.

There are multiple issues with her line of argumentation.

1. The [passage](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024024)  
from the study that she highlights is the following.

&gt;Our analysis indicates that Iwo Eleru possesses neurocranial morphology ***intermediate in shape between archaic hominins (Neanderthals and Homo erectus) and modern humans***\*\*.\*\* This morphology is outside the range of modern human variability in the PCA and CVA analyses,

What she ignores

&gt;***and is most similar to that shown by LPA individuals from Africa and the early anatomically modern specimens from Skhul and Qafzeh.*** Iwo Eleru is distinct from the recent African samples used here (although the range of recent modern human variation encompasses relatively low and elongated cranial shapes approaching this condition).

This is the important point. The Skull is anatomically ""Sapiens"", simply not close to the expected association to modern populations given the the pattern in other Continental populations.

In otherwords, this fossil is post the split of Neanderthal and Sapiens Morphology, not pre. She goes on refering to LH18, among the closer matches to Iwo Eleru. Here's a [source](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1612/1612.09595.pdf)

from 2016 on the association.

Regarding opinions of scientists prior to the study regarding the skull's morphology.

&gt;For example, all these authors express the opinion that the LH18 specimen (Magori and Day. 1983) **is on the lineage to living H. sapiens after it split from H. neanderthalensis**.

On the finds of his study.

&gt;Another useful result is showing that there can be **compatibility between this data set, the Procrustes skull shape distances analyzed in Waddell (2015), and traditional morphological expectations on where LH18 should fall in the tree, That is, as an early branching member of the pre-sapiens lineage (Rightmire 1998, Schwartz 2016,Stringer 2016).** If this is accepted, then the diagnosis of uniquely derived features (synapomorphies) for the last common ancestor of the Neanderthal and H. sapiens lineages needs to be reconsidered. The node marking all these specimens, plus LH18 does not appear to have any derived features that do not undergo reversions in this data. **The inclusion of LH18 in the diagnosis of the features of the last common ancestors of Neanderthals and H. sapiens also makes this ancestor look rather more like Kabwe or Petralona specimens in terms of features.** Given also the conflict between the trees in Waddell (2014, 2015, 2016) and Mounier et al. (2016) as to precise location of this specimen, it seems possible that the exact from of the ancestor of H. sapiens and Neanderthals will be hard to diagnose morpologically.

So, the basic conclusion of the study debunk E7's point on the status of Iwo Eleru.

This more or less applies to the [Ishango fossils dating 20k-30k](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27343771/)

Another fossil she brings up are the [Sibudu Teeth,](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330355760_Human_teeth_from_securely_stratified_Middle_Stone_Age_contexts_at_Sibudu_South_Africa)

found among Middle Stone Age tools (which include Microliths) that dat beteen 65k-77k. Note, despite this predating Eurasian Fossils expected to be linked to Modern Eurasians ( Tabun, Tianyuan Man, and others she mentioned for Europe) she still uses this as eivdence. Why?

What she mentioned.

&gt;The crown dimensions of the two teeth from Sibudu lie within the modern human range of variation—particularly SIB-3—but are larger compared to KDS PBE and SAMAP 6378 (Fig. 5; see Harvati et al. 2015). The metric dimensions overlap with ranges of both archaic and recent humans\*\*, but are closest to Neanderthal and UP European Homo sapiens remains, and generally larger than those of extant humans.\*\*

What she left out.

&gt;In terms of morphology, the less-worn crown of SIB-3 possesses several features similar to KDS PBE (e.g., 5 main cusps) some of them archaic (possible mid-trigonid crest, anterior fovea); SAM-AP 6378 is too fragmentary to assess these features. The preserved morphology on SIB-3 is compatible with either archaic or modern humans, though the expression of some traits (e.g., mid-trigonid crest) is low in recent and contemporary populations (see Online Source 1)**. In sum, the Sibudu teeth dated to &gt; 77–64 ka fit within the pattern of variation described for South African MSA humans—featuring populations with variable expressions of archaic and derived morphological traits and metric dimensions (see Grine 2000, 2016; Grine and Henshilwood 2002; Marean et al. 2004; Rightmire et al. 2006; Verna et al. 2013; Harvati et al. 2015)—and more generally match with a population of Homo sapiens that lies chronologically between the earliest members of the species and recent humans.**

So, unlike previous African fossils, they match the time period and context expected and are overall closer to Sapiens than to Archaic tooth complexes.

Now, a common feature of the prior two were that despite their recent age, they were NOT found to to be Phenotypically related to modern Africans. Does the Holocene recognize people that were? Asselar Man, now dated to around [5000-7000bc](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fcoek.info%2Fpdf-lhomme-fossile-dasselar-actuel-mali-etude-critique-mise-en-perspective-historiqu.html)

and Shum Laka, Dating to about [6000bc](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/sites/reich.hms.harvard.edu/files/inline-files/2020_Lipson_Nature_ShumLaka.pdf)

with occupation going back 30,000 are related to modern populations either genetically or skeletally.

One fossil neglected are the Nazlet Khater Individuals, both being found to be overall modern, with [Nazlet khater 4](https://www.academia.edu/12994922/The_position_of_the_Nazlet_Khater_specimen_among_prehistoric_and_modern_African_and_Levantine_populations)

being closer to the Khoisan than Eurasians, unlike Hofmeyr.

&gt;**Nevertheless, the Nazlet Khater specimen is clearly positioned within the range of MSA specimens and is outside the North African specimens’ range of variation. Among the sub-Saharan specimens, the Nazlet Khater is most similar to the MSA specimens from Springbok Flats and Kalomo.** The separ-ation of the Nazlet Khater from most of the studied fossils, and its aﬃnities with the MSA sample can be explained by one of the following hypotheses.

Further

&gt;Fur-thermore, the Nazlet Khater is also associated with Bambandyanalo K3a specimen and LSA specimens such as Willey’s Kopje 1, based on the secondprincipal component. **These results suggest that on the basis of shape(PC2) the Nazlet Khater is within the range of variability of Holocene and post-Holocene southern African populations.** However, Nazlet Khater departs from these populations by itssize (PC1) component.

Now, she went on to citing the 1998 work of [Joel D Irish](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248497901913)

, which was used to prove out of Africa, to explain Plesimorphies in the Sub Saharan Dental complex as results of Archaic admixture.

The abstract in question.

&gt;**Recent work found that the most ubiquitous of these traits are also present in dentitions of earlier hominids, as well as extinct and extant non-human primates; other ancestral dental features are also common in these forms.** The present investigation is primarily concerned with this latter finding. Quali-tative and quantitative comparative analyses of Plio-Pleistocene through recent samples suggest that, of all modern populations, **Sub-Saharan Africans are the least derived dentally from an ancestral hominid state; this conclusion, together with data on intra- and inter-population variability and divergence, may help provide new evidence in the search for modern human origins.**

Note, this doesn't specific place Sub Saharan Dental deatures into actual context to other fossil. a subsequent study would.

&gt;As stated elsewhere (Irish, 1998a), it would stand to reason that the modern comparative sample with the highest frequencies of ancestral traits should be phenetically most similar to the gracile hominins. **This semblance may not reflect a close phylogenetic relationship but, rather, a sharing of ancestral characters or symplesiomorphy. Further, there should be a lesser affinity to the robust hominins, with their more specialized dentitions. The gracile hominins in the present study (Table 5 and Fig. 2) are indeed dentally more similar to sub-Saharan Africans than any other comparative sample (21-trait MMD = 0.337)**. They are in next closest proximity to Australians (0.567) and Melanesians (0.582), which helps to sustain the idea of a symplesiomorphic relationship between the latter groups and sub-Saharan Africans (see Stringer et al., 1997; Irish, 1998a). The gracile hominins remain most distinct from dentally derived Sinodont samples of Northeast Asia (1.088–1.245) and, particularly, the New World (1.371–1.413). **The MMD distances relate, of course, to these particular traits and breakpoints only. Thus, sub-Saharan Africans are clearly not biologically closer to gracile hominins (0.337) than to modern Sinodonts (0.495–0.775); the former two simply share a greater number of ancestral ASUDAS traits.**

Note here that the ""ancestral traits"" are general features, that is though expected to be retained through time, rather than specialized. In other words, Apomorphic, hence how these traits supports OOA.

Joel Irish has many other studies that puts things into better perspective, but now I want to focus on other fossil related issues before getting into the Genetics.

She later cites a study claiming that Hofmeyr represents the origin of Modern traits in African populations, except for a few things.

At 36k, with no toolkit, it has no affinities to Modern African what so ever. Second, it post dates evidence of Sapiens Morphology (see examples in the linked post on Erectus Walks Among us.) with toolkits that are linked to modern stone using cultures. There is yet another error with the use of Hofmeyr in terms of genetic data (which does not exist for the specimen) but that is for later.

Likewise, it is actually more archaic than later Pleistocene African Skulls or Modern Sub Saharan populations.

&gt;Although the supraorbital torus is comparable in thickness to that in UP crania, its continuous nature represents a more archaic morphology ( 26 ). **In this regard, Hofmeyr is more primitive than later sub-Saharan LSA and North African UP specimens (such as Lukenya Hill and Wadi Kubbaniya), even though they may have a somewhat thicker medial supraorbital eminence.** Despite its glabellar prominence and capacious maxillary sinuses, Hofmeyr exhibits only incipient frontal sinus development, a condition that is uncommon among European UP crania ( 27 ). The mandibular ramus has a well-developed gonial angle, and the slender coronoid process is equivalent in height to the condyle. The mandibular (sigmoid) notch is deep and symmetrical, and its crest intersects the lateral third of the condyle. The anterior margin of the ramus is damaged, but it is clear that there was no retro- molar gap. The Hofmeyr molars are large. The bucco- lingual diameter of M 2 exceeds recent African and Eurasian UP sample means by more than 2 SD (table S3). Radiographs reveal cynodont molars, although pulp chamber height is likely to have been affected by the deposition of secondary dentine in these heavily worn teeth. **Thus, Hofmeyr is seemingly primitive in comparison to recent African crania in a number of features, including a prominent glabella; moderately thick, continuous supraorbital tori; a tall, flat, and straight malar; a broad frontal process of the maxilla; and comparatively large molar crowns.**

Also, are ""out of placed"" morphology unique to Africa? No, As Asia has too examples. The most interesting is this [Mongolian Skull](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190130075729.htm)

, originally deemed archaic, in fact turned out to have modern DNA while redated at around 34K. It does appear to have Denisovan admicture, however. Closer in Age to Iwo Eleru but MUCH broader in ancestry at [Longlin and Maldung](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221724538_Human_Remains_from_the_Pleistocene-Holocene_Transition_of_Southwest_China_Suggest_a_Complex_Evolutionary_History_for_East_Asians)

. The basic reason for each are simple, the continents are both huge and leads to survivals of traits due to this geographic potential.

Going into the Genetics, what studies do she use? She used [this](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/7/eaax5097)

often misrepresented study. The actual mean levels of admixture, not the interval in the title, is 6-7% for context, and further more the tree I linked to should provide context to the estimated date of divergence. To her credit, E&amp; actually does point out that a Heidelbergensis form is the expected morphological traits of the Ghost Archaic. What she obscures, however is how close this archaic sapiens is to either Neanderthals or Sapiens.

That wouldn't make Africans any different from admixed Non-Africans anyhow n light of Denisovan and Neanderthal DNA.

Another [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341828966_Ancient_Admixture_into_Africa_from_the_ancestors_of_non-Africans)

that she misrepresents is one that found that up to a third to near 40% of different Sub Saharan groups (West Africans, Nilotics, Pygmies, and the Khoisan) have ancestry from Basal Eurasians that lacked Neanderthal Admixture and where closer to neither Chinese or French samples (E&amp; claimed that ""French caucasoids"" went to Africa, despite the studies' actual words). Likewise, despite Hofmeyr's location in Southern Africa, such ancestry was lowest in Hunter gatherers of both Central and Southern Africa despite these populations being the most gracile.

&gt;Migration Pre-dates East-West Eurasian Divergence...**Inferred IMFs are not significantly di↵erent between Han Chinese and European populations in non-Afroasiatic populations (p=0.14, two-tailed paired t-test; Figs. 1h and S6, Table S1), consistent with migration occurring before the European-East Asian split approximately 40kya \[20\].**  
To assess whether the identified segments are plausible, we confirmed that their length distribution is consistent with IMF and timing of the migration inferred by SMCSMC (Supplemental Section S4.1, S11), and, as expected, we found that these African segments with putative Eurasian ancestry tend to be more closely related to a Eurasian sample than another representative of the same African population (Table S5, Supplemental Fig. S12, S13) in a global dataset of modern and ancient individuals compiled by the Reich group (see URLs). Within these African segments that are likely enriched for material with Eurasian ancestry, we then used D statistics \[13\] to identify enrichment for Neanderthal material compared to an African background. **We find no evidence for gene flow with a Vindija Neanderthal on the Mbuti baseline, or when compared to a di↵erent Yoruban (Table S6, S7).**  
We infer substantial Eurasian back-migration into all African groups, however the inferred IMFs for individuals from **Khoe-San populations are significantly lower than for any other group (di↵erence with Niger-Kordofians, 0.14±0.02, p = 4.4⇥1014; di↵erence with Nilo-Saharans, 0.20±0.03, p = 6.9⇥109, two-tailed t-test, Table S4).** To further support this observation we used MSMC to estimate the relative cross-coalescent rate (RCCR) for several populations, and find evidence for gene flow between Yorubans and Eurasians that is not shared with the Khoe-San individuals in either the SGPD and the HGDP (Fig. 1c,d). These results are consistent across Eurasian donor populations (Fig. S3). The Khoe-San individuals are particular outliers, whose ancestors are inferred to have experienced approximately half the amount of admixture seen in Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Kordofanian groups (Fig. S6). **In addition, we find that the Mbuti and Biaka, both Central African hunter-gatherer populations, show levels of Eurasian gene flow that are intermediate between levels observed in the Khoe-San and Yorubans (Fig. 1a,b, Supplemental Table S1). This is mirrored by inferred IMFs for Central African Hunter Gatherers, which are significantly lower than other Niger-Kordofanian groups (di↵erence 0.08 ± 0.03, p = 1.2 ⇥ 103, Table S4), possibly reflecting the proposed early split times of the Mbuti and Biaka from the remainder of ancestral African populations between 60 and 200kya \[41, 53\].**

&gt;In short, **the Pleistocene skulls from across Africa tend to be broad, long, with a broad face, and broad, short orbits**. In contrast, the skulls of the Khoisan (“Bushman”) population **are relatively short,low, broad, narrow, with a comparatively intermediate nose.** Pygmies are characterized by their great variability, **but they usually have small-size round skulls, and a balanced face.**

[Here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013620)

&gt;Size variation was associated with changes in shape; however, the axis of maximal shape variation (PC1) was not the most correlated with centroid size. The PC4 is the only PC which correlates with centroid size, which is associated with significant differentiation between groups. **Size-related shape variation involves a smaller face and shorter neurocranium in Western pygmies in relation to non-pygmies.**

,[40](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11213-w#ref-CR40), **but are anatomically derived and gracile**[**41**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11213-w#ref-CR41)**.**

Finally, the idea that mtdna U6 is associated with Hofmyer from [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062890/)

.

&gt;Under this perspective, the late Pleistocene human skull from Hofmeyr, South Africa, considered as a sub-Saharan African predecessor of the Upper Paleolithic Eurasians \[[51](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062890/#B51)  
\], should be better considered as the southernmost vestige of the *Homo sapiens* return to Africa. **The knowledge of its mtDNA and Y-chromosome affiliations would be an invaluable test for our hypothesis.** The rest of the human movements inside Africa, such as the Saharan occupation in the humid period by Eastern and Northern immigrations, or the retreat to sub-Saharan African southwards and to the Maghreb northwards in the desiccation period \[[52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062890/#B52)\], or even the colonization of the Canary Islands, **all faithfully reflect the scenarios deduced from the archaeological and anthropological information.**

In contrast to E7, they make the point that their suspicions of Hofmyer are based on *speculation* due to the associations of the study and is given comparatively less confidence than other parts of Africa where U6 actually has a legacy. They explicitly refer to it as a *hypothesis* requiring more genetic info.

As is stands, the suggestion is doubtful. Aside from the lack of U6 in the area, the Skull predates the earlies eivdence in the Mahgreb, which they assert on all other evidence as the source of U6 at 26k. This leaves a Gap up to 10k on the other end of the continent with no archaeological context.

By contrast, it is more likely that Hofmyer is related to the Basal Eurasian since there is a presence of this in the Khoisan, albeit low. This could also the explain the lack of associated tools. It fits the specified 30k-40k interval neater as well.

[A later study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.419069v2)

the same year would confirm the result Cole received, but cautioning when the divergence of the groups actually took place.

&gt;**We would like to caution that although we are naming the model “Back to Africa”, the OOA population did not need to be geographically out of Africa**[**68**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.419069v2.full#ref-68)  
**.** Our estimates, particularly the effective population size of B2A (N\_BC) and the time of Neanderthal introgression (T\_NIntro), advocate that the split might have happened within Africa itself before the actual out of Africa event. I**n such a case, our results can be explained by the separation of West and East African population 80 kya (T\_B) and then later the primary separation of OOA and East African population 67 kya (T\_Sep) (assuming mutation rate of 1.25×10-8 per bp per generation**[**58**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.419069v2.full#ref-58)**,**[**59**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.419069v2.full#ref-59) **and generation time of 29 years**[**69**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.419069v2.full#ref-69)**).** In this regard, our model is more akin to Lipson et al. 2020[**36**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.419069v2.full#ref-36) model rather than what is suggested by Cole et al. 2020[**35**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.419069v2.full#ref-35).

[This time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KqejmljxOY&amp;t=601s) she brings up ""Ghost Archaic Africans"" arguing that Sub-Saharans Africans, or West Africans who she refers to as ""Negroids"" are recent phenotypically speaking while at the same time are genetically diverged by haplotypes (Only A00 shows any evidence of this) from North Africans and other Eurasians due to archaic admixture.

Lets get into the various flaws, albeit perhaps not every single one.

First, lets address the significance of the title. It is a blatant reference to the terrible book by the same name addressed and debunked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/ik87n4/out_of_africa_not_debunked_richard_fuerle_and/). The thesis of this video is slightly different, as she is imprecise on what specimen characterizes ""Ghost Archaics"", Herectus or a post-erectus hominid such as represented by the Kabwe Skull? The issues regarding this will be explored forward.

She opens with a video clip and ""selective"" use of the Iwo Eleru skull. It is a skull that dates 10k-16k found in Nigeria associated with Late Stone Age technology. The significance of the skull is that it was found to be much earlier morphology, and would otherwise be classed with skulls dating to the Middle Stone Age.

There are multiple issues with her line of argumentation.

1. The [passage](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024024)  
 from the study that she highlights is the following.

&gt;Our analysis indicates that Iwo Eleru possesses neurocranial morphology ***intermediate in shape between archaic hominins (Neanderthals and Homo erectus) and modern humans***\*\*.\*\* This morphology is outside the range of modern human variability in the PCA and CVA analyses,

What she ignores

&gt;***and is most similar to that shown by LPA individuals from Africa and the early anatomically modern specimens from Skhul and Qafzeh.*** Iwo Eleru is distinct from the recent African samples used here (although the range of recent modern human variation encompasses relatively low and elongated cranial shapes approaching this condition).

This is the important point. The Skull is anatomically ""Sapiens"", simply not close to the expected association to modern populations given the the pattern in other Continental populations.

In otherwords, this fossil is post the split of Neanderthal and Sapiens Morphology, not pre. She goes on refering to LH18, among the closer matches to Iwo Eleru. Here's a [source](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1612/1612.09595.pdf)

from 2016 on the association.

Regarding opinions of scientists prior to the study regarding the skull's morphology.

&gt;For example, all these authors express the opinion that the LH18 specimen (Magori and Day. 1983) **is on the lineage to living H. sapiens after it split from H. neanderthalensis**.

On the finds of his study.

&gt;Another useful result is showing that there can be **compatibility between this data set, the Procrustes skull shape distances analyzed in Waddell (2015), and traditional morphological expectations on where LH18 should fall in the tree, That is, as an early branching member of the pre-sapiens lineage (Rightmire 1998, Schwartz 2016,Stringer 2016).** If this is accepted, then the diagnosis of uniquely derived features (synapomorphies) for the last common ancestor of the Neanderthal and H. sapiens lineages needs to be reconsidered. The node marking all these specimens, plus LH18 does not appear to have any derived features that do not undergo reversions in this data. **The inclusion of LH18 in the diagnosis of the features of the last common ancestors of Neanderthals and H. sapiens also makes this ancestor look rather more like Kabwe or Petralona specimens in terms of features.** Given also the conflict between the trees in Waddell (2014, 2015, 2016) and Mounier et al. (2016) as to precise location of this specimen, it seems possible that the exact from of the ancestor of H. sapiens and Neanderthals will be hard to diagnose morpologically.

So, the basic conclusion of the study debunk E7's point on the status of Iwo Eleru.

This more or less applies to the [Ishango fossils dating 20k-30k](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27343771/)

Another fossil she brings up are the [Sibudu Teeth,](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330355760_Human_teeth_from_securely_stratified_Middle_Stone_Age_contexts_at_Sibudu_South_Africa)

found among Middle Stone Age tools (which include Microliths) that dat beteen 65k-77k. Note, despite this predating Eurasian Fossils expected to be linked to Modern Eurasians ( Tabun, Tianyuan Man, and others she mentioned for Europe) she still uses this as eivdence. Why?

What she mentioned.

&gt;The crown dimensions of the two teeth from Sibudu lie within the modern human range of variation—particularly SIB-3—but are larger compared to KDS PBE and SAMAP 6378 (Fig. 5; see Harvati et al. 2015). The metric dimensions overlap with ranges of both archaic and recent humans\*\*, but are closest to Neanderthal and UP European Homo sapiens remains, and generally larger than those of extant humans.\*\*

What she left out.

&gt;In terms of morphology, the less-worn crown of SIB-3 possesses several features similar to KDS PBE (e.g., 5 main cusps) some of them archaic (possible mid-trigonid crest, anterior fovea); SAM-AP 6378 is too fragmentary to assess these features. The preserved morphology on SIB-3 is compatible with either archaic or modern humans, though the expression of some traits (e.g., mid-trigonid crest) is low in recent and contemporary populations (see Online Source 1)**. In sum, the Sibudu teeth dated to &gt; 77–64 ka fit within the pattern of variation described for South African MSA humans—featuring populations with variable expressions of archaic and derived morphological traits and metric dimensions (see Grine 2000, 2016; Grine and Henshilwood 2002; Marean et al. 2004; Rightmire et al. 2006; Verna et al. 2013; Harvati et al. 2015)—and more generally match with a population of Homo sapiens that lies chronologically between the earliest members of the species and recent humans.**

So, unlike previous African fossils, they match the time period and context expected and are overall closer to Sapiens than to Archaic tooth complexes.

Now, a common feature of the prior two were that despite their recent age, they were NOT found to to be Phenotypically related to modern Africans. Does the Holocene recognize people that were? Asselar Man, now dated to around [5000-7000bc](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fcoek.info%2Fpdf-lhomme-fossile-dasselar-actuel-mali-etude-critique-mise-en-perspective-historiqu.html)

and Shum Laka, Dating to about [6000bc](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/sites/reich.hms.harvard.edu/files/inline-files/2020_Lipson_Nature_ShumLaka.pdf) with occupation going back 30,000 are related to modern populations either genetically or skeletally.

One fossil neglected are the Nazlet Khater Individuals, both being found to be overall modern, with [Nazlet khater 4](https://www.academia.edu/12994922/The_position_of_the_Nazlet_Khater_specimen_among_prehistoric_and_modern_African_and_Levantine_populations)

being closer to the Khoisan than Eurasians, unlike Hofmeyr.

&gt;**Nevertheless, the Nazlet Khater specimen is clearly positioned within the range of MSA specimens and is outside the North African specimens’ range of variation. Among the sub-Saharan specimens, the Nazlet Khater is most similar to the MSA specimens from Springbok Flats and Kalomo.** The separ-ation of the Nazlet Khater from most of the studied fossils, and its aﬃnities with the MSA sample can be explained by one of the following hypotheses.

Further

&gt;Fur-thermore, the Nazlet Khater is also associated with Bambandyanalo K3a specimen and LSA specimens such as Willey’s Kopje 1, based on the secondprincipal component. **These results suggest that on the basis of shape(PC2) the Nazlet Khater is within the range of variability of Holocene and post-Holocene southern African populations.** However, Nazlet Khater departs from these populations by itssize (PC1) component.

Now, she went on to citing the 1998 work of [Joel D Irish](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248497901913)

, which was used to prove out of Africa, to explain Plesimorphies in the Sub Saharan Dental complex as results of Archaic admixture.

&gt;**Recent work found that the most ubiquitous of these traits are also present in dentitions of earlier hominids, as well as extinct and extant non-human primates; other ancestral dental features are also common in these forms.** The present investigation is primarily concerned with this latter finding. Quali-tative and quantitative comparative analyses of Plio-Pleistocene through recent samples suggest that, of all modern populations, **Sub-Saharan Africans are the least derived dentally from an ancestral hominid state; this conclusion, together with data on intra- and inter-population variability and divergence, may help provide new evidence in the search for modern human origins.**

Note, this doesn't specific place Sub Saharan Dental deatures into actual context to other fossil. a subsequent study would.

&gt;As stated elsewhere (Irish, 1998a), it would stand to reason that the modern comparative sample with the highest frequencies of ancestral traits should be phenetically most similar to the gracile hominins. **This semblance may not reflect a close phylogenetic relationship but, rather, a sharing of ancestral characters or symplesiomorphy. Further, there should be a lesser affinity to the robust hominins, with their more specialized dentitions. The gracile hominins in the present study (Table 5 and Fig. 2) are indeed dentally more similar to sub-Saharan Africans than any other comparative sample (21-trait MMD = 0.337)**. They are in next closest proximity to Australians (0.567) and Melanesians (0.582), which helps to sustain the idea of a symplesiomorphic relationship between the latter groups and sub-Saharan Africans (see Stringer et al., 1997; Irish, 1998a). The gracile hominins remain most distinct from dentally derived Sinodont samples of Northeast Asia (1.088–1.245) and, particularly, the New World (1.371–1.413). **The MMD distances relate, of course, to these particular traits and breakpoints only. Thus, sub-Saharan Africans are clearly not biologically closer to gracile hominins (0.337) than to modern Sinodonts (0.495–0.775); the former two simply share a greater number of ancestral ASUDAS traits.**

Note here that the ""ancestral traits"" are general features, that is though expected to be retained through time, rather than specialized. In other words, Apomorphic, hence how these traits supports OOA.

Joel Irish has many other studies that puts things into better perspective, but now I want to focus on other fossil related issues before getting into the Genetics.

She later cites a study claiming that Hofmeyr represents the origin of Modern traits in African populations, except for a few things.

At 36k, with no toolkit, it has no affinities to Modern African what so ever. Second, it post dates evidence of Sapiens Morphology (see examples in the linked post on Erectus Walks Among us.) with toolkits that are linked to modern stone using cultures. There is yet another error with the use of Hofmeyr in terms of genetic data (which does not exist for the specimen) but that is for later.

Likewise, it is actually more archaic than later Pleistocene African Skulls or Modern Sub Saharan populations.

&gt;Although the supraorbital torus is comparable in thickness to that in UP crania, its continuous nature represents a more archaic morphology ( 26 ). **In this regard, Hofmeyr is more primitive than later sub-Saharan LSA and North African UP specimens (such as Lukenya Hill and Wadi Kubbaniya), even though they may have a somewhat thicker medial supraorbital eminence.** Despite its glabellar prominence and capacious maxillary sinuses, Hofmeyr exhibits only incipient frontal sinus development, a condition that is uncommon among European UP crania ( 27 ). The mandibular ramus has a well-developed gonial angle, and the slender coronoid process is equivalent in height to the condyle. The mandibular (sigmoid) notch is deep and symmetrical, and its crest intersects the lateral third of the condyle. The anterior margin of the ramus is damaged, but it is clear that there was no retro- molar gap. The Hofmeyr molars are large. The bucco- lingual diameter of M 2 exceeds recent African and Eurasian UP sample means by more than 2 SD (table S3). Radiographs reveal cynodont molars, although pulp chamber height is likely to have been affected by the deposition of secondary dentine in these heavily worn teeth. **Thus, Hofmeyr is seemingly primitive in comparison to recent African crania in a number of features, including a prominent glabella; moderately thick, continuous supraorbital tori; a tall, flat, and straight malar; a broad frontal process of the maxilla; and comparatively large molar crowns.**

Also, are ""out of placed"" morphology unique to Africa? No, As Asia has too examples. The most interesting is this [Mongolian Skull](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190130075729.htm)

, originally deemed archaic, in fact turned out to have modern DNA while redated at around 34K. It does appear to have Denisovan admicture, however. Closer in Age to Iwo Eleru but MUCH broader in ancestry at [Longlin and Maldung](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221724538_Human_Remains_from_the_Pleistocene-Holocene_Transition_of_Southwest_China_Suggest_a_Complex_Evolutionary_History_for_East_Asians). The basic reason for each are simple, the continents are both huge and leads to survivals of traits due to this geographic potential.

Going into the Genetics, what studies do she use? She used [this](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/7/eaax5097)

often misrepresented study. The actual mean levels of admixture, not the interval in the title, is 6-7% for context, and further more the tree I linked to should provide context to the estimated date of divergence. To her credit, E&amp; actually does point out that a Heidelbergensis form is the expected morphological traits of the Ghost Archaic. What she obscures, however is how close this archaic sapiens is to either Neanderthals or Sapiens.

That wouldn't make Africans any different from admixed Non-Africans anyhow n light of Denisovan and Neanderthal DNA.

Another [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341828966_Ancient_Admixture_into_Africa_from_the_ancestors_of_non-Africans)

that she misrepresents is one that found that up to a third to near 40% of different Sub Saharan groups (West Africans, Nilotics, Pygmies, and the Khoisan) have ancestry from Basal Eurasians that lacked Neanderthal Admixture and where closer to neither Chinese or French samples (E&amp; claimed that ""French caucasoids"" went to Africa, despite the studies' actual words). Likewise, despite Hofmeyr's location in Southern Africa, such ancestry was lowest in Hunter gatherers of both Central and Southern Africa despite these populations being the most gracile.

&gt;Migration Pre-dates East-West Eurasian Divergence...**Inferred IMFs are not significantly di↵erent between Han Chinese and European populations in non-Afroasiatic populations (p=0.14, two-tailed paired t-test; Figs. 1h and S6, Table S1), consistent with migration occurring before the European-East Asian split approximately 40kya \[20\].**  
To assess whether the identified segments are plausible, we confirmed that their length distribution is consistent with IMF and timing of the migration inferred by SMCSMC (Supplemental Section S4.1, S11), and, as expected, we found that these African segments with putative Eurasian ancestry tend to be more closely related to a Eurasian sample than another representative of the same African population (Table S5, Supplemental Fig. S12, S13) in a global dataset of modern and ancient individuals compiled by the Reich group (see URLs). Within these African segments that are likely enriched for material with Eurasian ancestry, we then used D statistics \[13\] to identify enrichment for Neanderthal material compared to an African background. **We find no evidence for gene flow with a Vindija Neanderthal on the Mbuti baseline, or when compared to a di↵erent Yoruban (Table S6, S7).**  
We infer substantial Eurasian back-migration into all African groups, however the inferred IMFs for individuals from **Khoe-San populations are significantly lower than for any other group (di↵erence with Niger-Kordofians, 0.14±0.02, p = 4.4⇥1014; di↵erence with Nilo-Saharans, 0.20±0.03, p = 6.9⇥109, two-tailed t-test, Table S4).** To further support this observation we used MSMC to estimate the relative cross-coalescent rate (RCCR) for several populations, and find evidence for gene flow between Yorubans and Eurasians that is not shared with the Khoe-San individuals in either the SGPD and the HGDP (Fig. 1c,d). These results are consistent across Eurasian donor populations (Fig. S3). The Khoe-San individuals are particular outliers, whose ancestors are inferred to have experienced approximately half the amount of admixture seen in Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Kordofanian groups (Fig. S6). **In addition, we find that the Mbuti and Biaka, both Central African hunter-gatherer populations, show levels of Eurasian gene flow that are intermediate between levels observed in the Khoe-San and Yorubans (Fig. 1a,b, Supplemental Table S1). This is mirrored by inferred IMFs for Central African Hunter Gatherers, which are significantly lower than other Niger-Kordofanian groups (di↵erence 0.08 ± 0.03, p = 1.2 ⇥ 103, Table S4), possibly reflecting the proposed early split times of the Mbuti and Biaka from the remainder of ancestral African populations between 60 and 200kya \[41, 53\].**

&gt;In short, **the Pleistocene skulls from across Africa tend to be broad, long, with a broad face, and broad, short orbits**. In contrast, the skulls of the Khoisan (“Bushman”) population **are relatively short,low, broad, narrow, with a comparatively intermediate nose.** Pygmies are characterized by their great variability, **but they usually have small-size round skulls, and a balanced face.**

[Here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013620)

&gt;Size variation was associated with changes in shape; however, the axis of maximal shape variation (PC1) was not the most correlated with centroid size. The PC4 is the only PC which correlates with centroid size, which is associated with significant differentiation between groups. **Size-related shape variation involves a smaller face and shorter neurocranium in Western pygmies in relation to non-pygmies.**

,[40](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11213-w#ref-CR40), **but are anatomically derived and gracile**[**41**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11213-w#ref-CR41)**.**

Finally, the idea that mtdna U6 is associated with Hofmyer from [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062890/)

.

&gt;Under this perspective, the late Pleistocene human skull from Hofmeyr, South Africa, considered as a sub-Saharan African predecessor of the Upper Paleolithic Eurasians \[[51](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062890/#B51)  
\], should be better considered as the southernmost vestige of the *Homo sapiens* return to Africa. **The knowledge of its mtDNA and Y-chromosome affiliations would be an invaluable test for our hypothesis.** The rest of the human movements inside Africa, such as the Saharan occupation in the humid period by Eastern and Northern immigrations, or the retreat to sub-Saharan African southwards and to the Maghreb northwards in the desiccation period \[[52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062890/#B52)\], or even the colonization of the Canary Islands, **all faithfully reflect the scenarios deduced from the archaeological and anthropological information.**

In contrast to E7, they make the point that their suspicions of Hofmyer are based on *speculation* due to the associations of the study and is given comparatively less confidence than other parts of Africa where U6 actually has a legacy. They explicitly refer to it as a *hypothesis* requiring more genetic info.

As is stands, the suggestion is doubtful. Aside from the lack of U6 in the area, the Skull predates the earlies eivdence in the Mahgreb, which they assert on all other evidence as the source of U6 at 26k. This leaves a Gap up to 10k on the other end of the continent with no archaeological context.

By contrast, it is more likely that Hofmyer is related to the Basal Eurasian since there is a presence of this in the Khoisan, albeit low. This could also the explain the lack of associated tools. It fits the specified 30k-40k interval neater as well.

the same year would confirm the result Cole received, but cautioning when the divergence of the groups actually took place.

&gt;**We would like to caution that although we are naming the model “Back to Africa”, the OOA population did not need to be geographically out of Africa**[**68**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.419069v2.full#ref-68)  
**.** Our estimates, particularly the effective population size of B2A (N\_BC) and the time of Neanderthal introgression (T\_NIntro), advocate that the split might have happened within Africa itself before the actual out of Africa event. I**n such a case, our results can be explained by the separation of West and East African population 80 kya (T\_B) and then later the primary separation of OOA and East African population 67 kya (T\_Sep) (assuming mutation rate of 1.25×10-8 per bp per generation**[**58**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.419069v2.full#ref-58)**,**[**59**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.419069v2.full#ref-59) **and generation time of 29 years**[**69**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.419069v2.full#ref-69)**).** In this regard, our model is more akin to Lipson et al. 2020[**36**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.419069v2.full#ref-36) model rather than what is suggested by Cole et al. 2020[**35**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.419069v2.full#ref-35).

&gt;Is sex binary? The use of the term “binary” is one that many seem to trip over. According to the dictionary definition, binary means “consisting of, indicating, or involving two.” As a biologist, I can confidently say this definition accurately describes biological sex. That is because the sex of an individual refers to one of two—and only two—functional roles that an individual may play in sexual reproduction. Males are defined as the sex that produces small, motile gametes (sperm), and females produces large, sessile gametes (ova). There is no third gamete between sperm and ova, and therefore there is no third biological sex apart from males and females. Intersex is an umbrella term that refers to external sex ambiguity or a mismatch between internal sexual anatomy and external phenotype, but it is not a third sex.

&gt;It becomes apparent, however, that to many activists the phrase “sex is binary” is interpreted as meaning that every single individual can be categorized as either male or female. While it may be true that not every individual may be classifiable as either male or female, this does not refute the claim that sex is binary, only that not every individual may have a determinable sex. Sex is binary in humans because—in line with the dictionary definition of binary—it “consists of” and “involves” two and only two sexes.

&gt;Is sex apparent at birth? For the overwhelmingly vast number of people, yes. The prevalence of infants presenting with intersex conditions or disorders/differences of sexual development (DSDs) is around 0.2 percent (about 1 in 500).

&gt;However, DSD is a much broader category than intersex and does not necessarily denote sex ambiguity. For instance, Klinefelter (XXY) males and Turner (X0) females are not sexually ambiguous at all, yet are often considered DSDs. When we use a [clinically-relevant definition of intersex](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224490209552139) such as “conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female” the rate of individuals whose sex does not appear obvious at birth decreases by more than an order of magnitude from 0.2 percent to 0.018 percent (~1 in 5500).

Stop. First off his ""clinically-relevant definition of intersex"" comes from a 2002 paper, and by a [unsavory source](https://sillyolyou.wordpress.com/2019/06/19/whod-you-just-cite/) at that. So what is a good definition of ""intersex""?

&gt;So, to answer the question “is sex apparent at birth?”—yes, for almost everybody. The fact that 0.018 percent of babies may appear sexually ambiguous potentially resulting in misclassification of sex at birth doesn’t mean that the current classification system is wrong or flawed. It just means that biology can be messy at times. Though a misclassification rate of only 0.018 percent likely places sex among the most consistent phenomena in all the life sciences.

&gt;While it may be true that some phenomena, such as sex differences in neuroanatomy, facial features, and hand morphology are multivariate phenomena that can’t be reduced down to single factors, biological sex is not a multivariate phenomenon. There are many properties associated with one’s sex, such as hormone profiles and chromosomes, but these do not define an individual’s sex. Rather, we identify an individual’s biological sex by their primary sex organs (testes vs ovaries), as these organs are what form the basis for the type of gamete (sperm vs ova) an individual may potentially produce.

Sounds like special pleading, ""yeah other sexually dimorphic traits are multifaceted, but not the one we use to identify sex with!"" If there are so many traits that can exist independently of genitalia, why focus on it? What about those born without genitalia? 

&gt;Despite what the ACLU claims, biological sex can be reduced down to a single characteristic: gonads. But while rare edge cases may exist, this does not make our present understanding of biological sex useless or arbitrary.

I thought that the person might have some valid points so I decided to watch it. Lo and behold, I saw a variety of claims that I just could not find evidence for after further research. So, I decided to make this post going through all of his claims and why they either vastly oversimplify research or are completely wrong. I will present all of his claims as quotes from his video, with timestamps for each quote. Without further adieu, enjoy.

**Claim 1: ""If you eat enough of them, long enough, allergens start to build up and you will have an allergic reaction.""** [\[0:50\]](https://youtu.be/5Y7K82cCJnQ?t=50)

An allergic reaction to peanuts is caused by the presence of IgE antibodies specific to peanut proteins. When bound to peanut proteins, these antibodies induce the release of cytokines and chemokines, causing an allergic response. The key point here is that allergic people have these specific antibodies while non-allergic people do not, and allergic people usually develop a response after ingesting just 1 peanut\[1\]. This is all to say that if you eat a few peanuts and have no adverse reaction, you most likely do not have the peanut protein-specific antibodies and will not develop an allergic reaction no matter how many peanuts you eat. The idea that you can have one if you eat too much is laughable.

**Claim 2: ""\[peanuts are\] fairly high in Omega-6 fats and linoleic acid. Omega-6 fats cause inflammation and many diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, fat gain, cancer, autoimmune diseases, etc.""** [\[1:17\]](https://youtu.be/5Y7K82cCJnQ?t=77)

This claim dramatically oversimplifies ongoing research in the effects of Omega-6 consumption. The problem is, most of the above assertions are heavily debated. Indeed, the best review of the current research on Omega-6 I could find says:

&gt;...studies in healthy human adults have found that increased intake of arachidonic or linoleic acid does not increase the concentrations of many inflammatory markers.  Epidemiological studies have even suggested that ARA and LA may be  linked to reduced inflammation. Contrastingly, there is also evidence  that a high omega-6 fatty acid diet inhibits the anti-inflammatory and  inflammation-resolving effect of the omega-3 fatty acids. Thus, the  interaction of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and their lipid mediators  in the context of inflammation is complex and still not properly  understood. \[2\]

In essence, while it is technically possible for all of Claim 2 to be accurate, it is also possible for Omega-6 fats to actually have the opposite effect of what the video claims.

**Claim 3:  ""Most people don't know but peanuts actually grow underground where they tend to be colonized by a fungus called Aspergillus, a source of aflatoxins which are toxic and just highly carcinogenic.""**[\[1:40\]](https://youtu.be/5Y7K82cCJnQ?t=100)

Now it is true that aflatoxins can be very deleterious to your health. What is NOT true (if you live in the developed world) is that you can get aflatoxins from peanuts. The FDA, for example, has stringent requirements that limit aflatoxin levels to less than 20ppb, with the result being that there has been exactly zero outbreaks of aflatoxin-related illness in the United States. \[3\]\[4\]

**Claim 4: ""Even if you stop eating peanuts, the fungus continues to grow inside of you and over time becomes toxic""**[\[2:03\]](https://youtu.be/5Y7K82cCJnQ?t=123)

This is completely and utterly wrong. We breathe in fungal spores constantly with no adverse effect. Why? Because we have something called an immune system. Furthermore, fungal infections rarely arise from eating the wrong food, since the spores must survive the highly acidic environment of the stomach. Something must go very, very wrong for fungus that you consume to start growing inside of you.

**Claim 5: ""Peanuts are high in Lectins, which are bad for your health...causing inflammation, weight gain, memory problems, joint pain, diabetes, etc""**[\[2:29\]](https://youtu.be/5Y7K82cCJnQ?t=149)

This is another example of vastly simplifying scientific research. Indeed, epidemiological studies (flawed as they are) showed that lectin-containing foods are associated with a *decreased* rate of  cardiovascular disease, weight gain, and type 2 diabetes. Notice how some of these (decreased weight gain and diabetes) directly contradict the video's assertion. This is not even getting into other possible benefits of lectins, such as its antioxidant and anti-cancer properties. \[5\] A final note is that around 30% of the foods we eat contain significant amounts of lectin, including foods generally recognized as healthy such as carrots, tomatoes, and zucchini. \[6\]  It makes no sense to zero in on peanuts as something you shouldn't eat because of its lectin content.

&amp;#x200B;

*TLDR/Conclusion:*  The video's assertions range from the absurd (eg: that fungal spores from peanuts will grow inside you once eaten) to merely a dramatic oversimplification of research (eg: the video's claims on the effects of omega-6 and lectin). Indeed, I have a hard time finding a single claim on the health effects of peanuts that the video makes that is verifiably true.

I'll admit to responding a bit too emotionally to his responses and failing to address everything he brought up, but some of his points were just faulty. Here are some snippets he pinned in the comment section of one of his videos along with an updated response to them.

&gt; Here is part of an argument I had with a Barney fanatic:   
&gt;  
&gt;""Crocodiles survived because they can survive months without food due to their slow metabolism. Dinosaurs didn’t have this adaptation because they weren’t cold blooded, so they starved.""      
&gt;  
&gt;Dinosaur means terrible lizard. That's because they were supposed to be reptiles. Reptiles are cold-blooded. Special pleading for millions of imaginary creatures there. Another house of cards (consisting of fallacies). And even IF they were warm-blooded, that doesn't explain why warm-blooded creatures, smaller and weaker, could have survived but not dinosaurs. ""So they starved"" is a lie since in your narrative there were plenty of proto-mammals to eat, and plenty of plants for those mammals to eat. More special pleading. 

First of all, reptiles are a pretty wide category of animals, so having some be warm-blooded isn't that implausible. In fact, some reptiles such as leatherback sea turtles are gigantotherms, meaning that they are so large that they can more easily maintain a constant, relatively high body temperature than smaller animals simply by being large. Other reptiles, such as the Argentine black and white tegu, are capable of switching between warm and cold blood.

As for the second point, the reason why there were mammals that survived the extinction was that they were able to hide in places the dinosaurs couldn't reach and sustain themselves on insects, roots, and aquatic plants, which dinosaurs did not have access to. It is also likely that some mammals were capable of hibernation, whereas dinosaurs as far as we know were not, meaning that they could theoretically wait out periods of famine while dinosaurs could not

&gt;""proto mammals were small enough to survive underground where the dinosaurs couldn’t reach them,""    
&gt;  
&gt;More special pleading that small dinosaur predators could not reach them. Remember dinos come in all shapes and sizes, according to the sci-fi lore.     
&gt;  
&gt; Also, you have never seen a leopard wait for a warthog to venture outside of its burrow?      
&gt;  
&gt;You are revealing that you don't know about animals. 

Apparently, a leopard waiting outside a warthog burrow for a few hours is analogous to a velociraptor waiting for days on end for a small mammal to emerge from a burrow. While it is true that dinosaurs came in all shapes and sizes, the smallest dinosaurs were still significantly larger than most mammals alive at the time, and even then most of them were likely either insectivores or lacking the traits required for burrowing.

&gt; ""no mention the fact that a dinosaur the size of a t-rex would not have been able to sustain itself on mammals no bigger than a mouse.""      
&gt;  
&gt;Velociraptors were unable to feed on proto-mammals? Nonsense.     
&gt;  
&gt;T-Rexes could not eat many small meals to make up for lack of big meals? Nonsense.     
&gt;  
&gt;There was enough plants for many small mammals but not enough for a few big mammals? Nonsense.     
&gt;  
&gt;All of it is nonsense. All of it is UNPROVEN. All of it is fiction.  

These statements ironically reveal that this guy doesn't really know that much about animals since he believes that tyrannosaurus could survive by feeding on the mammals alive at the time. Given the fact that most mammals back then were no bigger than a house cat, it would be highly unlikely that T-rex would be able to sustain its hunger. It's comparable to a lion trying to sustain on mice, not only would the lion not be unable to adequately sustain its hunger, but by trying to catch mice it would end up wasting more energy than it would gain, causing it to starve to death even faster. 

Granted, dinosaurs like velociraptors could probably have survived on mammals for a period of time, due to being significantly smaller than T-rex, but as mentioned before, it could not burrow to catch the smaller, faster ones or wait for days on end to make a kill.

As for his point about there being enough plants for small mammals but not enough for big mammals, as mentioned earlier there were no big mammals during that time, and many of the surviving mammals were likely omnivorous, so this point really has no merit to it.",True,False,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,28517.0,public,self,Guy doesn't understand why dinosaurs went extinct,0.0,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/n85gui/guy_doesnt_understand_why_dinosaurs_went_extinct/,,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While outcomes are best assessed as directly as possible, understanding fundamentals of science will give you more insight on how to hypothesize and will tend to present to you more “safe” assumptions on food quantities and how they interact with your body. It is not just lobbying or corporate money that drives bad nutrition science, it is individuals that want to eat more of something because they like the taste or feeling it gives (see “craft beer” craze, bullet proof coffee, “a drink of alcohol per night”, animal fat chewers, chocolate’s properties = a chocolate bar a day). 

For examples of what I mean, let’s look at some basic macromolecules and minerals simply in an outlook of quantity (dose). I think looking at food similar to this as a baseline can help with proper skepticism with future food articles. 

-Oils. They are everywhere in the typical Western diet. You cook with them, they are added to prepackaged foods and dumped on salads and used in sauces. Looking at the nutrition content of oils, they are fat. That’s what they are. Now some have different types such as saturated (medium chain, long chain) and unsaturated (mono-, poly-) Knowing how abundant oils are, what would make an oil “healthy”? Why is coconut oil said to be healthy and unhealthy at the same time? Same question lingers for butter. Simply put, fats in our diet functions to help absorb certain vitamins and can be used as reserve fuel. But beyond that, why are people taking spoonfulls of olive oil or coconut oil? Or throwing globs of butter in their coffee? You would think with a society as nutritionally abundant as ours and with oils showing up galore, we wouldn’t need it. The short answer is people usually don’t. Omega 3 ratios and the like are a different discussion and are more to my point about abundance in diet (or proportionally, lackthereof in this case)

-Sodium. Look at nutrition labels of your packaged foods and see how much of this stuff is added to everything. The FDA’s daily value for sodium can be exceeded in one small meal at a restruant or fast food chain or an assortment of prepackaged snacks. Despite a medical condition, no one is running out of iodine anytime soon. There has already been a large body of research examining high levels of sodium intake and its effects on the cardiovascular system over time, let alone the total metabolic load, so why turn a blind eye to sodium or read the latest “nutrition” article on how you aren’t “replenishing your salts” after your workout (if there was no demand for trendy writing, there would be no trendy articles).

-Sugar. I almost don’t need to mention this one but the amount of added sugar in products present a metabolic load that may surpass the dangers of fats and salt combined (this statement is not a scientific statement, it is a comparison for effect). Let’s just take the added sugars out of this equation here and look at what we are left with whole foods. There are scales used to determine the metabolic impact of sugar intake such as the glycemic index and insulin index. They are good at abstractly assessing the potential for rise in blood sugar after consumption and the corresponding impact it has on your body’s insulin response. White potatoes, wheat bran, and dates are all considered “high” on one or more of these indicies. This does not negate nutritional value of these foods (which all three have) but demonstrates an important baseline for the impact sugar has on us but moreso, the added sugar atop these foods, most often in a form of cane sugar. 

-Protein (Brotein). I can almost assure you that you won’t run out. Vegans, you have to be cautious about this sometimes but same goes for the mindset of your diet. I can’t believe how pumped the protein “industry” is. Adding protein to everything now, “protein fueled snacks”, “whey protein 30 mins after workout for maximum absorption”, protein bar craze. You don’t need that much protein. No reputable scientific body suggests over 1g of protein per pound of body weight. This is beyond any threshold. There has been some evidence linking excess protein consumption to load on kidneys in the form of chronically or acutely elevated BUN. Some conclusions are lacking in terms of whether this has a long term or impactful effect on developing kidney problems... but... what does 1.5 g of protein per pound of bodyweight get you? This is what I mean by leanings. I don’t know about you, but I’m leaning in on thinking I don’t NEED to drink daily protein shakes on top of my servings of meat consumption, egg consumption, and yogurt consumption. Unless you are a professional body builder or athlete or the like, I don’t know what the use would be. 

To recap, this gives a general sense of how to look at nutrition in the future. It gives a good dose of skepticism and leanings in what we fundamentally understand about abundant macros and minerals. There is more complex ascertains, like the ratio of fats, animal vs plant fats and proteins, gut bacteria, etc. Keep in mind anecdotes or those with medical conditions don’t refute our understandings of how nutrition affects the general public and the foods that are marketed.

Some of the most common substances include calcium hydrogen carbonate and slightly higher than normal levels of sodium chloride.

The calcium salts make water hard but on boiling they decompose and precipitate as calcium carbonate which forms a scale in kettles and boilers. 

Today I was amazed when I heard a young, reasonably intelligent man say that he does not drink tap water because the same 'stone' that forms in boilers forms in his kidneys to give him kidney stones. 

We need calcium in our diets and only a tiny amount is provided by tap water.

So in the comments here, I made a statement claiming that the scientific method is literally based on falsifying bad ideas, and as such, ""debunker"" is not a negative term IMO.   


I very quickly discovered myself arguing with some real strange people, with some really out-there ideas about the philosophy of science. You are welcome to read the full text yourself, but for the sake of time, I'll summarize here.  


1. One of the guys pointed out that historically speaking, scientists aren't necessarily always great at being proper skeptics, and made the argument that if we were ""proper skeptics"" we'd have to throw out most of the social sciences; because a lot of statements in the social sciences are unfalsifiable. I pointed out that just because not everyone lives up to the scientific ideal of eliminating one's own biases does not actually devalue it as a ideal; and I also pointed out that the problem with the ""social sciences"" is that they are ""soft sciences"" that are not as able to properly test/quantify their ideas as the ""hard sciences"" so if anything, we should entirely expect (and desire) for the soft sciences to throw out a lot of bad data as their methodologies, and tools get better, and with some nice elbow grease, they perhaps could be upgraded from being ""soft"" sciences to being ""hard sciences"" and that is in fact what we should want out of them, as they aren't that great in their current state.
2. The other one (and this one totally baffles me) made the argument that ""Under the philosophy of falsification, the statement that gravity is at normal strength today; is equally valid as the statement that gravity will be double strength on Tuesday.""  No amount of my pointing out that centuries of observational data show the normal strength of gravity as being pretty damn consistent, mostly, most of the time (except when say dealing with quantum mechanics or dark matter) and pointing out that we can't test the idea of gravity being double strength on tuesday, until Tuesday seemed to make a difference to him. Like holy hell, 5 year olds are capable of understanding that something that has been tested thousands of times, is not the same as something that has never been tested at all. Hell, grab a 5 year old. You can run this test yourself. Ask a 5 year old if they like the flavor of their favorite food. Obviously, since it's their favorite food, and they've eaten it thousands of times, the answer will be ""yes"". Then ask them if they like the taste of a food that they've never heard of before. You might get some adorable 5 year old answers, but you are also very likely to get an honest ""I don't know, and I won't know until I taste it"" So not only does this guy, not see a difference between an observed, well tested fact, and an unobserved, untested bald-faced assertion, but he makes the claim that since the two statements are ""equivalent under falsification"" that somehow ""his example demonstrates the falsification isn't the end-all-be-all of science"".  
The actual hell? Yes, falsification has some limits. After a certain point we are unable to test some of our underlying assertions; and that sucks. Just... God-fucking-damn, yes, science can tel the difference between a tested and an untested claim. thank you very much. Science literally uses falsifiability as a concept to distinguish between tested and untested claims and that's kinda sorta the entire goddamn point. 

So yup. Not having fun arguing with crazy tonite.

&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003552119300974](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003552119300974)  
&gt;  
&gt;Why is this discovery so significant?   
&gt;  
&gt;Here's the answer. Ever since the discovery of the so-called  ""neanderthal"" skulls throughout Europe, and in some parts of Western  Asia (Anatolia (the land of ancient Greeks) and Caucasia), there have  been a small group of anthropologists who vehemently opposed Libtards'  ""Out of Africa"" myth. They argued that the fossil record suggest that  Europe's ""Neanderethals"" were direct ancestors of modern Humans (Homo  Sapiens) and further argued that the libtard delusion/propaganda of  ""Neanderthals"" going extinct and being replaced by invading Apefric\*\*ns  is just a massive, politically-motivated lie.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now these 2 male and female skulls, which have a combination of  ""Neanderthal"" and emerging modern Human (Homo Sapiens) features,  conclusively prove that humans are descended from those ""Neanderthals""  who lived, throughout Europe, hundreds of thousands years ago and that  as (we, Chimpmaniacs, already know) Humans and Ni\*\*ers are not related  or descended from the same ancestors.   
&gt;  
&gt;And here's another research finding about ""Neanderthals"":  
&gt;  
&gt;***Unlike ni\*\*ers' cannibal ancestors, ""Neanderthals"" buried their dead***  
&gt;  
&gt;""A multi-disciplinary team led by researchers at the CNRS and the Muséum  national d'histoire naturelle (France) and the University of the Basque  Country (Spain) has demonstrated that the body of a two-year-old  Neandertal child was purposefully buried in a pit dug, around 41,000  years ago, at the Ferrassie site (Dordogne) in Europe.""

Here’s an article from a website called crev.info claiming that the relatively recently discovered scansoriopterygid dinosaur ambopteryx was actually a bat that was misidentified. Here are some of the most frustrating excerpts from the website:

“A 3-D reconstruction, completed at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China on May 8, 2019 shows it flew with bat-like membranous wings. The Jurassic Period dinosaur Ambopteryx, (meaning “both wings”) longibrachium (meaning “long arm”) looks nothing like a dinosaur, so why call it a dinosaur?”

From the images shown of the fossil,[ambopteryx](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnature%2Fjournal%2Fv569%2Fn7755%2Ffull%2Fs41586-019-1137-z.html&amp;psig=AOvVaw0DW8t-m_kx0Q-Zw1cFJp2O&amp;ust=1611484792474000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCNCY3-ruse4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAT) is identifiable as a scansoriopterygid, a group of arboreal dinosaurs including [yi qi](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.nz%2Fpin%2F385550418077604806%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw2W5-WJc4Uz-SlzzL81kB_o&amp;ust=1611485324017000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCJj0hufwse4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAN) and [epidexipteryx](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Farchosaurmusings.wordpress.com%2F2008%2F10%2F24%2Fguest-post-the-vampire-peacock-of-daohugou%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw2XUs1uwGa7u_fbt5VNMzgj&amp;ust=1611485397444000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCOiW64nxse4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAJ). The claim that it doesn’t look like a dinosaur doesn’t really hold up because the author is seemingly unaware of these two animals.

“The reconstruction by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology, as well as the description made by a careful examination of the fossil, makes it look almost identical to an extinct bat. They want it to look like a dinosaur because evolutionists consider it additional evidence of the so-called “feathered dinosaurs” discovered recently. They think this one adds evidence supporting their theory that dinosaurs evolved into birds. The bat discovered is presented as evidence of an “alternate evolutionary path for airborne dinosaurs.””

The following few paragraphs are the author of the article trying to debunk the idea that ambopteryx was a failed evolutionary experiment, followed by him accusing scientists of intermingling the animal into dinosauria without much thought on their part. Now let’s get to the evidence of this animal supposedly being a bat.

“One major trait of dinosaurs is they are egg-laying reptiles. I was unable to find any evidence that Ambopteryx bats were egg-laying reptiles.”

So, because there’s no direct evidence that ambopteryx layer eggs, that means that it gave live birth? Judging by the photographs taken of the [specimen](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnature%2Fjournal%2Fv569%2Fn7755%2Ffull%2Fs41586-019-1137-z.html&amp;psig=AOvVaw1hEzczoQf5LC9DunBPzkgV&amp;ust=1611485931299000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCNj4yInzse4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAJ), there is no evidence that the animal was pregnant upon death, so the idea that it gave live birth has just as little support, if not less.

“Conversely, bats are nocturnal mammals, not reptiles, usually frugivorous or insectivorous that possess wings formed from four elongated digits of the forelimb covered by a cutaneous membrane. They have good vision but often rely on echolocation and give birth to their young which they breast feed.” 

Most of these features cannot be verified in ambopteryx, due to a lack of stomach contents and the skull being to crushed to make out proper details.

The article also fails to adequately compare the wing membranes of the two animals as well, possibly because doing so would reveal fatal flaws in the idea that ambopteryx is just a bat. The [wing configuration ](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fenglish.netmassimo.com%2F2019%2F05%2F11%2Fambopteryx-longibrachium-was-a-tiny-dinosaur-with-bat-wings%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw0JQ2sjy6zwJWF6VyBis0UC&amp;ust=1611486848535000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCIDt1rz2se4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAU) of ambopteryx is a little bit difficult to make out due to the position of the hand in the fossil, but it appears most similar to that of its close relative [yi qi](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.audubon.org%2Fnews%2Fsomething-strange-winged-way-comes&amp;psig=AOvVaw16iSAJvalyv4HlDlrtX0yt&amp;ust=1611486987358000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCJij_Ir3se4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD). In both of these animals, the three fingers support sparser membranes while the rest of the membrane is spread out across a straight bony protrusion on the wrist. This is entirely unlike [bat wings](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fucmp.berkeley.edu%2Fmammal%2Feutheria%2Fchiromm.html&amp;psig=AOvVaw32NjvbvUnrDQUKpgMXqgUZ&amp;ust=1611487131292000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCLClmMb3se4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD) where the membrane is supported by 4-5 elongated fingers that each splay outwards when they fly.

“In a Darwinian trance, Black speculates,

in the depths of the Jurassic, feathered dinosaurs started to take to the air. Clawed arms that had evolved to snatch and catch began to take on a new aerodynamic role, and feather-coated limbs began flapping as the earliest avian dinosaurs overcame gravity to leave the surface of the Earth behind. But not all fluffy saurians launched into the air the same way. An unexpected discovery from China reveals an enigmatic family of dinosaurs with bat-like wings… The dinosaur’s wings were more like those of bats, which wouldn’t evolve for more than 100 million [Darwin] years, or like the leathery wings of contemporary flying reptiles called pterosaurs.

So, this dinosaur is said to have evolved into bats? This find was not speculation by amateurs, but written up in the most prestigious science journal Nature by leading researchers claiming that “Powered flight evolved independently in vertebrates in the pterosaurs, birds and bats, each of which has a different configuration of the bony elements and epidermal structures that form the wings.” That hints that the Ambopteryx find may be actually have been the precursor of modern bats as this paper has concluded, and not a dinosaur evolving into a bird as other authors imply.”

How in any way is the quote suggesting that ambopteryx is a bat ancestor? It’s literally just saying that it’s wing configuration is more like that of a bat which hadn’t evolved yet, it said nothing of them being descended from it. The quote cited also mentions pterosaurs as well, so by the same logic ambopteryx is also a close relative of pterosaurs.

&gt;Graur says “For selection to operate and counteract the effects of random genetic drift, the effective population size should be large.” Well, it would be nice if the effective population size were large, but that is by no means necessary. 

&gt;German Shepherds were created in the 1890s, by interbreeding several breeds of dogs ( and wolves !), followed by selection for desired traits. That didn’t require tens or hundreds of thousands of dogs. Thoroughbreds are the fastest horses in existence: their effective population size is around 100. Dachshunds are smaller than they were in the 1970s – but then everybody knows they’re contrary enough to violate the laws of genetics. Born that way, probably

So humans breeding animals is the same as normal human evolution...he does know breeding accelerates things and causes mutations intentionally right? 

&gt;I could go on – and on, and on. Every example we have of selection on domesticates is a counterexample to what Grauer is saying here. No farmer he. Does he think that some ancient geneticist corralled a million aurochsen in order to breed the domesticated cow?

&gt;A large population size is nice, because it generates more favorable mutations, but that is not necessary. Selection, at least in the short run, does not require any new mutations at all. Nice, because a large population size reduces the strength of chance, so the probability of the change in the trait under selection stalling or reversing in a given generation is lower – the results of selection become more predictable, especially in the short run. Next, Grauer talks about the long-term effective population size (EPS) in humans being around 10,000 – which he seems to think is too low for selection to work. He’s wrong, but that number is also the wrong number. He’s talking about the neutral-theory effective population size, which is a function [ harmonic mean] of long-term population size over the last million years or so – and it’s the wrong ‘effective population size’ for selection questions. There are different values of EPS for different questions. The right one is the “Variance EPS, which tells you the theoretical population size that yields the same noise in allele frequency change, right now. It basically measures how little a population is susceptible to drift.” The correct value of EPS, for different continental branches of humanity, has been hundreds of thousands to millions for a long time, well before agriculture was developed.

Does he think all evolution works like eugenics? 

&gt;Graur is making a very basic mistake: he is perfectly happy making an argument to which there are many counterexamples. They don’t bother him. Even one counterexample should bother you. As I said, every domesticate is a counterexample to what he’s saying. We know of many genetically caused differences between human populations, such as height, skin color, disease resistance, ability to efficiently utilize certain foods, tolerate high altitude, low temperatures, high levels of arsenic, etc etc. By ‘we’ I mean anyone who can read. Some of those genetic differences are caused by new forms of one or a few genes ( like sickle-cell), others by small shifts in the frequency of many alleles that influence the traits.

Yes. It is called epigenetics. Humans aren't domesticated animals.

I am not going to comment on panpsychism here, except to note that it had better start finding proponents who know what they are talking about when it comes to physics. The current state of panpsychism allows me to endlessly farm karma on this sub. I won't be quoting the entire article, but only bits with unsound reasoning or factually incorrect statements.

&gt; [Johannes] Kleiner and his colleagues are focused on the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness, one of the more prominent theories of consciousness today. As Kleiner notes, IIT (as the theory is known) is thoroughly panpsychist because all integrated information has at least one bit of consciousness.

The problem here is that IIT is wrong. To believe IIT is like believing phlogiston after we've discovered iron wool and other metals gain mass when burned. [Here](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1799) is computer scientist Scott Aaronson on the topic of why IIT is incorrect, but the TL;DR is that IIT proposes a quantity that should be large for conscious systems and small for unconscious systems, and because intuition is the only thing we have to go off of when judging whether something is conscious, it had better align with (at least most of) our intuitive assignments of consciousness. And IIT fails at this. A matrix could be constructed such that it has vastly more consciousness than a human, as Aaronson explicitly does in the blog post.

The more important problem, however, is that the author of this *Nautilus* article, Tam Hunt, *doesn't actually believe IIT*. He is simply using IIT to prop up the idea that panpsychism is tenable, while he believes another version of panpsychism. This is invalid. If we have successfully constructed a theory that strongly agrees with our intuitions of consciousness, but implies that everything has a tiny amount of consciousness, then sure, it is a panpsychic theory. However, Hunt's preferred theory of consciousness *posits* panpsychism. An implied result and a posited property are different matters entirely. For example, the luminiferous ether. If the Michelson-Morley experiment really did find a rest frame for light, that implies a luminiferous ether. However, since it did not, and in fact the universe obeys (local) Lorentz invariance, positing a luminiferous ether (as William Lane Craig does) is unjustified, and violates the principle of parsimony. Analogously, an accurate theory of consciousness that implies panpsychism and panpsychism posited as a theory itself are completely different, and must be evaluated independently.

&gt;While there are many versions of panpsychism, the version I find appealing is known as *constitutive panpsychism*. It states, to put it simply, that all matter has some associated mind or consciousness, and vice versa. Where there is mind there is matter and where there is matter there is mind. They go together. As modern panpsychists like Alfred North Whitehead, David Ray Griffin, Galen Strawson, and others have argued, all matter has some capacity for feeling, albeit highly rudimentary feeling in most configurations of matter.

This is one such example of what I call posited panpsychism, which is different from implied panpsychism.

&gt;Panpsychists look at the many rungs on the complexity ladder of nature and see no obvious line between mind and no-mind. Philosopher Thomas Nagel famously asked in 1974 what is it like to be a bat, to echolocate and fly? We can’t know with any certainty, but we can reasonably infer, based on observation of their complex behaviors and the close genetic kinship between all mammals and humans—and the fact that evolution proceeds incrementally—that bats have a rich inner life. **By the same logic, we can look steadily at less-complex forms of behavior that allow us to reasonably infer some kind of mind associated with all types of matter.** Yes, including even the lowly electron. 
&gt;
&gt;While inanimate matter doesn’t evolve like animate matter, inanimate matter does behave. (emphasis added)

Indeed, we can reasonably infer, from the complex behavior of bats and their relationship with humans, that bats have some degree of consciousness. Therefore, we can infer whether something has consciousness from its behavior and relationship with humans. Keep that in mind.

&gt;While inanimate matter doesn’t evolve like animate matter, inanimate matter does behave. It does things. It responds to forces. Electrons move in certain ways that differ under different experimental conditions. These types of behaviors have prompted respected physicists to suggest that electrons may have some type of extremely rudimentary mind.

What behaviors do we see the electron exhibit that allow us to infer a mind? They travel as waves, they interact with various quantum fields. Are those behaviors complex enough to allow us to infer a mind? Well, no. Would anyone say a tsunami is conscious? Or that skipping a stone on a pond's surface is evidence of the pond's consciousness?

We can also infer from the relationship of bats and humans that bats have some degree of consciousness. What is the analogous relationship between humans and electrons? There is no such analogous relationship.

And so *by the same logic*, using Hunt's own words, electrons don't have the complex behavior or a relationship with humans that allows us to infer they are conscious. This is extremely flimsy reasoning.

&gt;For example the late Freeman Dyson, the well-known American physicist, stated in his 1979 book, *Disturbing the Universe*, that “the processes of human consciousness differ only in degree but not in kind from the processes of choice between quantum states which we call ‘chance’ when made by electrons.” Quantum chance is better framed as quantum choice—choice, not chance, at every level of nature. David Bohm, another well-known American physicist, argued similarly: “The ability of form to be active is the most characteristic feature of mind, and we have something that is mind-like already with the electron.”

Bohm's quote, at least, is inaccurate. (I haven't checked Dyson's.) Googling the quote gives me multiple sources that have cited Michael Talbot's *The Holographic Universe*, which as far as I could tell is a book of woo. That book, in turn, cited ""Bohm, *Wholeness*, p. 192"". Typing ""Bohm Wholeness"" into Library Genesis gave me Bohm's *Wholeness and Implicate Order*, which does not contain the quote.

Setting aside the accuracy of the quotes, as the point should be independent of who made them, this is false. To posit that electrons make *choices* would require that they have internal states that differ. I'll come back to this later.

Sabine Hossenfelder comes in with a rare voice of reason (in multiple senses):

&gt;Theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, author of the 2018 book Lost in Math, has taken a contrary position. “[I]f you want a particle to be conscious, your minimum expectation should be that the particle can change,” she argued in a post titled “Electrons Don’t Think.” “It’s hard to have an inner life with only one thought. But if electrons could have thoughts, we’d long have seen this in particle collisions because it would change the number of particles produced in collisions.”

Hunt linked to the crosspost on *Nautilus*, but [here](http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/01/electrons-dont-think.html) is her original blog post. For more entertainment, check out the comment section where Philip Goff, as artuncut, displays the phenomenon I've noted in the title.

&gt; Rather than being unchanging things moving around in a container of space-time—the modern view in a nutshell—Whitehead conceives of particles like electrons as a chain of successive iterations of a single electron that bear a strong likeness to each other in each iteration, but are not identical to each other. Each iteration is a little different than the last. There is no static and unchanging electron. The degree to which each iteration is more or less different than the last iteration is the place for an iota of choice, and mind. This iota of choice compounds upwards and, through the course of biological evolution, results in the complex types of mind and choice that we humans and other mammals enjoy.

Clearly Hunt did not read the very article by Hossenfelder that he linked. Let's take this paragraph sentence fragment by sentence fragment.

&gt;Rather than being unchanging things moving around in a container of space-time—the modern view in a nutshell

This is completely false. The modern view is quantum field theory, in which quantum fields are fundamental. Particles are merely ripples in quantum fields. The most obvious implication is that particles are not unchanging. They can interact with other fields. They can become more general disturbances in other fields, or even turn into ripples in multiple fields, i.e. different particles. And given the container of spacetime, this mistaken view is even more untenable. Typically we carry out quantum field theory in a flat spacetime, but in light of work done by an obscure physicist named Stephen Hawking, we now know that certain spacetime geometries can cause the notion of a particle to be observer-dependent. This container of spacetime is precisely what makes particles change in this case.

&gt;Whitehead conceives of particles like electrons as a chain of successive iterations of a single electron that bear a strong likeness to each other in each iteration, but are not identical to each other.

This is simply ruled out by experiment. I say ""by experiment"", but it is really more ""by observation"". I'll go into some of the mathematical details here, so if you don't care about the math, the TL;DR is that electrons are identical otherwise we won't hve the periodic table. Now you can skip the next four paragraphs.

Let's say there are two paricles in a joint quantum state |Ψ;Φ〉. The first slot is the state of the first particle, and the second is the state of the second. You can swap their states to get |Φ;Ψ〉, then swap them again to get |Ψ;Φ〉 back. If the two particles are distinguishable, |Φ;Ψ〉 is an obviously different state. However, if the two particles are identical, |Ψ;Φ〉 would be physically indistinguishable from |Φ;Ψ〉 in all observables. This means there are two possibilities: Swapping the particles does nothing to the state, not just the observables, or swapping the particles does something to the state, but doesn't affect the observables. For the latter case, remember that swapping the particles twice returns it to its original state, so if we represent the particle-swapping operation as P, then what we get is P^(2)|Ψ;Φ〉 = |Ψ;Φ〉. This means P^2 = 1, and therefore P = ±1. The P = +1 case does nothing: P|Ψ;Φ〉 = (+1)|Ψ;Φ〉, which implies |Φ;Ψ〉 = |Ψ;Φ〉. But the P = -1 case would be more interesting: P|Ψ;Φ〉 = |Ψ;Φ〉 implies |Φ;Ψ〉 = -|Ψ;Φ〉. This doesn't produce a change in the observables because the square of the state gives the observables, so once again (-1)^2 = 1 saves us from observable differences between the states.

Let's say that there are two states the particles can be in, A and B. There are two ways you can put the particles into the states, forming the joint states |A〉|B〉 (once again, first slot is the first particle's state) or |B〉|A〉. The principle of superposition says that any two states added together in any proportion (including negative or complex numbers) is another valid state. Now let's try adding them together to make the two identical particle states. For P = +1, it's straightforward: (|A〉|B〉 + |B〉|A〉). P(|A〉|B〉 + |B〉|A〉) = |B〉|A〉 + |A〉|B〉 = |A〉|B〉 + |B〉|A〉, which is the original. For P = -1, it's (|A〉|B〉 - |B〉|A〉). P(|A〉|B〉 - |B〉|A〉) = |B〉|A〉 - |A〉|B〉 = -(|A〉|B〉 - |B〉|A〉), which is negative of the original.

Now think back to the beginning, if the particles were distinguishable. Sure, you can do P^(2)|Ψ;Φ〉 = |Ψ;Φ〉, but now, because the square of |1;2〉 is not equal to the square of |2;1〉, all bets are off the table. Because of these observable differences, |A〉|B〉 is distinguishable from |B〉|A〉, and so when you add them together in their different proportions, all of those superpositions are distinguishable. You wouldn't get the pretty (anti)symmetry properties when you swap the two particles.

Electrons are fermions: the P = -1 case. So what happens if you try to put two of them into the same state? |A〉|A〉 - |A〉|A〉 = 0. The joint state doesn't exist. Therefore it is impossible to put two fermions such as electrons into the same state. And that's how atoms work. You can't put two electrons into the same state around an atomic nucleus. That's how you build up the periodic table.

So if two electrons were not identical, their joint states become distinguishable upon swapping their individual states. This means the antisymmetry of swapping fermions does not apply, and therefore they can occupy the same state. This means they can occupy the same state *around an atom*, and therefore all will collapse down to the lowest electron shell with the lowest angular momentum. And since the periodic table relies on electrons in an atom's outermost electron shell, and this means there is no outermost electron shell, we can say goodbye to chemistry, and therefore molecules/giant atomic structures, and therefore anything you can see. Hence ""disproved by observation"".

Now you might say that this only disproves the view that electrons are distinguishable at the same time. They could still change the same way over time, only remaining identical in the same moment. But indistinguishable at the same time according to whom?

As we know from relativity, simultaneity is relative. If electrons are indistinguishable according to someone on the surface of Earth, to someone travelling on the International Space Station, moving at more than 7 km/s, the electrons *are* distinguishable, because their present moment differs from ours. For that matter, the electrons that make up the ISS would be distinguishable to someone on Earth, and once again, goodbye chemistry.

&gt;Each iteration is a little different than the last. There is no static and unchanging electron. The degree to which each iteration is more or less different than the last iteration is the place for an iota of choice, and mind. This iota of choice compounds upwards and, through the course of biological evolution, results in the complex types of mind and choice that we humans and other mammals enjoy.

And therefore all of this, based upon the false premise that electrons are not identical from one moment to the next, falls apart.

&gt;I am fleshing out in my work how we can turn these “merely” philosophical considerations about the nature of mind throughout nature into a testable set of experiments, with some early thoughts sketched here. Such experiments move debates about panpsychism out of the realm of philosophy and more firmly into the realm of science.

Its title: Rest mass of photon on the surface of matter. I quickly dismissed this, as this title clearly shows that their discoveries apply to condensed matter systems and isn't a discovery of an actual photon mass.

But then I read the abstract:

&gt; The behavior of a photon is strange. It possesses both wave nature and particle nature. Some experiments show both behaviors of photons can exist simultaneously, while some other experiment state that both properties do not co-exists simultaneously. According to electromagnetic theory, the rest mass of photon in free space is zero and also photon has non-zero rest mass, as well as wavelength-dependent. The very recent experiment revealed its non-zero value as 10^-54 kg (5.601×10^-25 MeV c^(-2)). Even experimental results concluded that within matter (dispersive) the photon shows its imaginary rest mass. We have no exact answer as to why photon incarnates itself with versatile mass. Here we try to theoretically investigate about the rest mass of a photon. When it touches the surface of matter, it makes illusion and mathematically the rest mass is a complex number. Rest mass of photon depends upon scalar curvature of the surface of matter and wavelength of the photon. Photon itself reveals illusion posing with mass because of its dual nature. We have investigated the wave-particle duality of light, coexistence of wave and particle nature through morphing due to pliable character of light wave. Our theoretical work about the photon’s *illusive mass* will have to be experimentally verified and it might open plausible new applications in the secure communication of information.

What?

Okay, first of all, grammar. Second of all, is this about matter systems or not? This is such a confusing abstract. I know that the effective mass of photons could change in a condensed matter system, but that's not what we mean by a photon mass, as I've said above, but then it also seems to claim that the actual photon has a mass?

I won't try to copy and past every section of the paper; go read it yourself, but I will put some hightlights here.

&gt; Some of the physical laws of nature are very peculiar; especially whose velocity is nearly equal to the velocity of light in free space (quantum object).

This is literally the first sentence of the paper proper (that is, excluding the title and abstract.) That's not a quantum object. That's a relativistic object. Literally in the first sentence, we get a basic undergrad-level (or not even undergrad-level) mistake.

&gt;Wave and particle nature comes due to the interference ‘ability’ and ‘inability’ of photon respectively [5], [6] although this is the adopted functional definition [6]. Both properties of light are coexist simultaneously through continuous morphing [5], [6], [7], [10].

Not really sure what is being expressed here, but [[6\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0117) really does adopt the (in)ability to interfere as a functional definition of whether it is a particle or a wave.

This ""morphing"" was explaned in [6], but not in the paper itself: It has something to do with preparing an ancilla qubit in the state = cos α|0〉+ sin α|1〉, then entangling it with a photon such that the joint state becomes |ψ'〉 = cos α|particle〉|0〉 + sin α|wave〉|1〉, and by varying α, you can ""morph"" the interference pattern continuously from a particle-like ""interference pattern"" to a wave-like interference pattern. The lack of explanation in the paper is a huge oversight.

&gt;Although the phase velocity (wave-like) of photon does not carry information [21], [22], ‘c’ has been made constant for the “purpose of metrology” [13], based only on Maxwell’s equation without any proof [12]. So this is not absolutely true which we have taken one of the fundamental laws of nature. According to Electromagnetic theory the rest mass of light wave is zero, but there are so many theoretical and experimental approaches which reveal that it is very small [1], [13], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27].

The authors completely ignore all the evidence beginning from the Michelson-Morley experiment of the invariance of the speed of light, and further, the fact that the definition of the meter as the distance light travels in 1/299792458 of a second was only ratified in 1983, 122 years after Maxwell's equations were published.

As for the very well-cited sentence, [1] is de Broglie's PhD thesis, *Recherches sur la théorie des quanta*, (""Research on the theory of quanta""), which uses the outdated concept of r\*l\*t\*v\*st\*c m\*ss, instead of what we would call mass now, which is √(p_μ p^(μ)), i.e. the square root of the inner product of the 4-momentum, which equals the rest mass for massive particles and 0 for massless ones. [13] is Severe limits on variations of the speed of light with frequency, which, given the title, makes it clear that things are not looking good for the massive photon thesis' prediction of different speeds for different colors. [23] and onwards are only experiments that give us more improved upper bounds for the photon mass, and no lower bound. Taken in conjunction with our theories, this means that the photon is most likely massless. The data is definitely consistent with this. Their citations don't show what they want them to.

&gt;Different types of experiments have been done which shows that rest mass of photon; by satellite measurement of earth’s magnetic field is 4×10^-51 kg (2.244×10^-21 MeV c^(-2)) [24], low frequency parallel resonance circuits is 10^-52 kg (5.610×10^23 MeV c^(-2)) [25], solar wind experiment is 1.5×10^-54 kg (8.414×10^-25 MeV c^(-2)) [26]. Using the frequency-dependent time delays in measurements of the dispersion measures (DMs) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) on FRB 150418 and FRB 121102, the photon mass measured is 3.2×10^-50 kg (1.795×10^-20 MeV c^(-2)) [28] and 3.9×10^-50 kg (2.188×10^-20 MeV c^(-2)) [29] respectively.

Even putting aside the fact that the authors have confused the upper bound with the actual value, does the plethora of disparate values for the photon mass not concern them at all?

&gt;Even experimentally, it has been shown that electromagnetic wave (photon) has an imaginary rest mass in the medium (dispersive) which is comparable to electron-neutrino mass [34]. So photon has no fixed real mass like other particles and objects, it can be zero and have real; imaginary value again.

This is another elementary error. Photon quasiparticles in condensed matter systems do gain a mass, but this isn't a photon being massive, but a photon, *in addition to the matter it is in*, giving vibrations that act like a photon but is massive. This should be well-known to anyone who investigates the problem of whether photons are massive.

The subsequent computation is hilarious or depressing depending on your perspective. First it claims the mass of the photon is its mass in free space added to the imaginary effective mass of a photon quasiparticle on the surface of a solid, the latter of which they claim is the rest mass multiplied by the Ricci scalar of the surface somewhow? I kid you not. The paper is open access, so click on it.

And then they claim that in free space, R_μν = 0 so the value of the imaginary effective mass is 0 in free space. Which just isn't true. Free space can be curved to give a nonzero R_μν.

But onto the discussion:

&gt;Because of wave-particle duality, photon rest mass and wave-like velocity of photon (phase velocity) are correlated. Here ‘illusion’ does not mean it is not the truth but it appears as something else. In case of light, sometimes manifested as mass-less, sometimes wavelength-dependent real mass; sometimes imaginary; sometimes inversely wavelength dependent when velocity is constant. But we don’t know why light wave shows these various *incarnation*…indeed due to *mass illusion*. Mathematically, we represented ‘illusion’ as a complex number. That’s why we realize wave-velocity of photon (phase-velocity) does not carry any information [21], [22]. (emphasis in original)

If anyone understands what they are trying to convey here, please let me know. And now for a brief message from our sponsor Deepak Chopra:

&gt; Photon appears to us whatever we want to realize it as a wave or as a particle or both; so it comes to us as per our desire because of its *pliable* character, due to this character photon show wave-particle duality. We hope this theoretical enlightenment about photon *illusive mass* will be experimentally verified in coming future and it will bring renaissance in the secure information communication.

I honestly have no idea how to refute this except to get a laser pointer, wrap a wire or a string or something sufficiently opaque in front of it, wish really hard that the photons will display their particle nature, and find out that it still shows an interference pattern.",True,False,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,27274.0,public,self,The worst paper I have ever read.,0.0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/klmm5v/the_worst_paper_i_have_ever_read/,,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dark,,,,,,bc3e1cf2-f6aa-11e4-94dd-0e967552239b,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of you might already see something wrong with the post just from the title. However, having looked further into the article the post links to, I can say that the study the post relies on has some serious methodological issues.

**Issue #1: The survey uses a loaded question**. The study uses the statement ""I want the world to change significantly and become more sustainable and equitable rather than returning to how it was before the COVID-19 crisis"" and asks the responders whether they strongly or somewhat agree or disagree. The problem here is that making things more sustainable and equitable is something that is almost universally seen as desirable, so of course people would agree. This is akin to asking someone whether they want the world to be a better place and being surprised that they say yes. Indeed, the comment section of the post seems to have picked up on this as well, and this is the most obvious flaw with the study.

**Issue #2: The ""global survey"" includes just one country in all of Africa.** That country is South Africa. Indeed, it is quite worrying that a study purporting to represent the global population should only sample one country from the entire continent of Africa. There are other large gaps in the study samples as well, no central American countries were sampled and just one country in southeast Asia (Malaysia) was sampled. That's simply too many holes in our knowledge to give an accurate impression of how the global population responds to the question.

**Issue #3: Samples from 11 of the 28 countries in the study were not representative of their general population.** This is something that the study itself openly admits but is completely absent from the article. Here is the study's words exactly: ""The samples in Brazil, Chile, China (mainland), India, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey are more urban, more educated, and/or more affluent than the general population. "". This appears to be the problem with online surveys, since large segments of the population in developing nations don't have access to the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

I think these reasons are enough to show that the reddit post and the article it links both have gaping flaws that make their conclusions unreliable. I have attached all of the relevant links below. Some of the issues I mentioned were brought up in the comment section of the original post- namely, many people did notice the loaded question in the title. I suppose the one thing that confused me was how that post got so many upvotes, since the post's findings seem self-evident and not really that interesting.

So what are your takes on the science wars?

I think it’s important to inquire about the underlying causes, not simply vilify pseudoscientists and call for them to be censored (which often only helps them by giving them more publicity and letting them portray themselves as martyrs).

I’m coming from a relatively unique perspective, since I’m a disaffected former STEM major myself (I obtained my degree but have been unable to secure a career in the field I studied, in part due to being on the autism spectrum and thus having a difficult time following the norms of most workplaces). Thus I’m arguably an example of what [the sociologist Peter Turchin](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/can-history-predict-future/616993/) might call a “counter-elite”. 

I think simply blaming the other side for everything is the wrong idea—I would like to see the scientific community become more introspective and self-critical, because in some ways they may have contributed to the problem themselves.

Part of the issue is that the scientific method has actually changed since the beginning of the Scientific Revolution. This is likely due to a number of causes including: the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass capitalism, the decline of independent scientists (or “gentleman scientists” as they used to be known), rigorizing and formalizing intellectual movements like positivism, and the ever-increasing tendency toward specialization and credentialism at the expense of generalist and self-educated approaches.

All of these shifts are arguably related to one another and divide what one might call “classical” science from “modern” science. The classical approach to science, much like the classical liberal economics of Adam Smith, took a high view of the common people—science was for everyone, and the scientific method was a philosophy anyone could live their life by. If I experience A followed by B enough times, I can infer that whenever I experience A in the future I will also subsequently experience B.

In contrast, modern science is very magisterial and places emphasis on credentialed elitism, to the point that it becomes little more than “trust the experts, you uneducated swine!” Which was very much _not_ the attitude of the earliest scientists; back in those days, you’d expect to hear that kind of language from the church hierarchy but not from scientists. Early science encouraged skeptical thinking in the classical ([Pyrrhonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhonism)) sense of the word, whereas today’s so-called “skeptics” are actually dogmatic materialists. I suspect science, and academia more broadly, may be in need of a reformation of its own.

Here’s what that might look like, in four points:

- Adopt an “intuitionist” approach to science, whereby a scientific theory is only considered settled once the majority of the population not only knows it but also understands _why_ it is true. I acknowledge climate change is real, not because I “trust the experts” but because I’ve studied the relevant science on my own and I _myself_ understand why and how the greenhouse effect works. _That_ is the mindset we should be encouraging, because telling people to simply trust a bunch of experts in an ivory tower is elitist and undemocratic, especially since the people considered to be experts in the past often got things _very_ wrong.
In this approach, the burden falls on scientists to explain their findings to the public in a way that the vast majority of them can understand, and thus we should conduct science in the vernacular, not technical jargon—and if no vernacular term currently exists for a concept, one should be created. 

- Redirect funding from “hard” sciences having little practical use (such as much of particle physics and astrophysics) to “soft” sciences with more practical benefit to humankind. Remember the song “Whitey On The Moon?” That critique is still accurate today when applied to things like the LHC and the discovery of elements like oganesson, which gobble up enormous quantities of public funding with little practical utility. Those are arguably today’s version of the over-extravagant Renaissance cathedrals. One could even adopt a pragmatist epistemology toward science. As a society we embraced the scientific method because it _works_ and is _useful_, and something like string theory (which may not be experimentally testable at all) satisfies neither criterion and could be questioned on those grounds.

- Replace materialism with a more parsimonious viewpoint, something like an intersubjective idealism (in which the basis of reality is conscious experience itself, not matter, but the definition of consciousness is expanded to include relationships between individuals and thus this view does not collapse into solipsism, unlike ordinary subjective idealism). This has the advantage of rendering the controversy over whether we are in a simulation moot, because intersubjective idealism is _substrate-independent_. The question of whether we are experiencing a universe of real matter or one of bits and bytes _simulating_ real matter simply becomes irrelevant (what’s important is the experience itself) which is good because we would never be able to find out either way.

- Redirect university funding. Formal education, by its very nature, is not for everyone—universities as we know them were created by neurotypicals, for neurotypicals, and inherently marginalize all other learning styles. Instead of wanting everyone to go to college, we should instead ensure that everyone has access to a good job and livable income _whether they attended college or not_. This avoids the “overproduction of elites” problem.

&gt;&gt;In one sense, science is the enterprise of seeking truth by formulating hypotheses and testing them against the evidence. If a hypothesis is repeatedly tested and found to be consistent with the evidence, we may tentatively regard it as true. If it is repeatedly found to be inconsistent with the evidence, we should revise it or reject it as false. This is empirical science.

&gt;Or in other words, that is science as an “open process.” Dr. Wells goes on:

&gt;&gt;In a second sense, science can refer to the enterprise of providing natural explanations for everything — that is, accounting for all phenomena in terms of material objects and the physical forces among them. But this is equivalent to materialistic philosophy, which regards material objects and physical forces as the only realities. Mind, free will, spirit, and God are considered illusions. This is materialistic science.

And they are wrong how? How are they empirically testible? Hell the first two can at least be explained by [thermodynamics](https://medium.com/@manuel_brenner/the-thermodynamics-of-free-will-940cacd02401#:~:text=The%20free%20energy%20principle%20states,surprise%2Fmaximize%20Bayesian%20model%20evidence.)

So you are wrong there 

&gt;&gt;In a third sense, science can refer to the scientific establishment, which consists of people who are trained and employed to conduct research in various areas. The majority opinion of this group is referred to as “the scientific consensus.” Unfortunately, the scientific consensus has changed many times in the course of history, so it is not a reliable guide to the truth. And although many people in the scientific establishment do excellent empirical science, the scientific consensus is currently dominated by materialistic philosophy.

&gt;The science cult unites those two final senses, where the “consensus” has drifted toward materialist dogma.

&gt;The cult enthrones politics and ideology and calls it “science.” That hurts the credibility of whatever goes by the name of science, unfortunately including the open-ended process of discovery that truly is scientific. The ideologues have themselves to blame. But what a mess! It impacts everyone, inside and outside of the cult.

Like your friend Heather MacDonald https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/iak8fq/what_errors_does_heather_macdonald_make_here/

https://vdare.com/posts/heather-mac-donald-s-speech-censored-by-youtube-in-spite-of-her-careful-non-race-realism
&gt;If your 12-year-old son goes on YouTube, he can watch a porn star giving a lap dance to a happily surprised young man. He can see nubile, naked girls spooning with a naked male and frolicking in Las Vegas hotel pools. Your 14-year-old daughter can watch videos on how and why to transition to the male gender.

&gt;Both your son and daughter can learn how to become an “antifa warrior.” Under the tutelage of an anarcho-communist YouTube host, they can celebrate the fiery destruction of a Minneapolis police precinct during the recent anti-police rioting in that city, a conflagration the ­anarcho-communist deems the “high point” of the rioting to date. They can get tips on how to suit up for further anti-police action — with helmets, water bottles and, of course, personal protective equipment.

&gt;Yet your children can’t watch a livestreamed speech on policing I gave Thursday, arguing that US law enforcement isn’t engaged in systemic violence against blacks. YouTube has deemed the speech inappropriate for children under 18 and blocked access to minors.

Its funny because none of what she says is true. Especially on censorship and what people see on YouTube. https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190719/23273342619/all-trumps-complaints-about-social-media-censorship-white-house-itself-moderates-content-similarly-to-social-media-sites.shtml

&gt;Here's what you need to know about Heather Mac Donald: not only is she working for entirely respectable institutions—the Manhattan Institute and Minnesota's Center For The American Experiment are part of Conservatism, Inc, in a way we've never been—but she is very much not a race realist. She's a crime realist, but that's not the same thing.

Which is why she called herself a race realist later in the article...
&gt;Speaking as a race realist,

Ignoring that, she can't get crime rates right. 

Back to the original article: 
&gt;You might object that math is a rational inquiry, not an empirical one; and that there is no need for the MAA to take any position at all on race realism. Sure, yeah, but the heading as it stands is open to a positive interpretation.

&gt;Vain are the hopes of man! In fact, the statement is mainly an angry denunciation of the Trump administration's bans on the anti-white indoctrination of the federal workforce.

&gt;I'll just quote the last paragraph to give you the flavor

Ah yes Cherry picking from the actual article. Lets see: https://www.mathvalues.org/masterblog/anti-science-policy-censure-of-discourse-on-race-and-racism

&gt;&gt;Policy must be informed by facts and science. Thanks to science and mathematics, we understand now that masks, social distancing, frequent, rapid, mass testing, and contact tracing are all fundamental to keep our communities safer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet policies at the federal level have not consistently reflected these facts; for example, choosing not to incorporate a mask-mandate in the US has had serious consequences. As Michael Dorff and Michael Pearson stated in a recent Math Values blog, “We encourage MAA members, regardless of political persuasion, to speak out for the value of science and mathematics, and hold our leaders accountable to make use of the best possible scientific evidence in policy decisions.” The social sciences are part of this community, helping us understand how to effectively communicate these practices to people, while also simultaneously analyzing our practices and policies with a critical lens. Critical race theory, referenced in recent Executive statements by the President of the United States, is an established social science inquiry which is grounded in decades of scholarship. It is misguided, at best, to reduce this theory to the race-blaming of white people and to define it and the discussion of systemic racism as a “divisive concept.” Furthermore, banning training utilizing this scholarship to raise consciousness, from federal and federal contractor workplaces, is an encroachment on science and the academy. At the first presidential debate this year, President Trump’s refusal to disavow white nationalism and his encouragement of groups that the FBI has identified as the greatest threats of domestic terrorism, only serves to reinforce the sense that his administration seeks to reverse decades of progress on civil rights for all citizens. These actions frame a current United States leadership that consistently promotes policy in direct opposition to data and science-based evidence. 

&gt;&gt;Although mathematics, science, and higher education develop fact-based theories and practices that should inform policy, they are also political because they exist within a highly politicized system.   Acknowledging that the United States has serious systemic discrimination has somehow leaped from a political issue to a partisan issue. More alarmingly, what we see is a series of pronouncements apparently designed to suppress conversation and action on race and racism in the United States.

&gt;&gt;As mathematicians, we notice patterns - this is something we are all trained to do. We bring these Executive actions to our community’s attention for several reasons: we see the pattern of science being ignored and the pattern of violence against our colleagues that give voice to race and racism. We need to fight against these patterns. As educators, we also recognize the threatening pattern of banning education and withdrawing education funding to suppress conversations on race and racism, extending from elementary to postsecondary institutions to the workplace and research spheres. 

How does he respond that science can be bent by politics, by accusing the left of projection.

&gt;And is it actually true that ""mathematics is created by humans""? If the human race were to be wiped out by a rogue solar flare next Tuesday, would two plus two still be equal to four? If two stars in our galaxy went supernova, and then two more, would that be four supernovas altogether?

Math comes from the laws of logic, but our logic is effected by bias so...

&gt;One thing that is indisputably the case is that the math we have today was created by, or stands on foundations created by, persons of white-European or West Asian stock, well-nigh all of them male. I don't think …

&gt;Sounds of screaming.

&gt;Sorry, sorry, sorry. Never mind.

&gt;So how do I feel about this MAA statement? For a person like me, who reveres math, it is crapping on the altar.

Unlike you, who ignores where mathematics came from? http://www.taneter.org/math.html#:~:text=Ancient%20African%20Mathematics&amp;text=Africa%20is%20home%20to%20the,and%20geometry%20in%20daily%20life.

For someone who supposedly loves math, this is an massive oversight.

Then again they engage in [whataboutism](https://vdare.com/posts/minneapolis-city-government-scheduled-sacred-conversations-for-black-bodied-staff) when talking about slavery.

And off course ignore huge [racial double standards](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForwardsFromKlandma/comments/etogtx/racist_essays_have_not_aged_well/)

Do you know why the space astronauts wear two different colour suits during their space travel ?

The orange suits are known as Advanced Crew Escape Suits (ACES) and are worn only during liftoff and reentry. These suits are fully pressurized and include locking components that ensure that if the astronauts need to escape from the shuttle they will not loose any of the components and thus pressure from the suit. The suits also contains a parachute harness and a survival pack.

The orange color is to increase visibility of the astronauts so rescue crews would be able to find them in the event of a bailout from the shuttle.

The white suits are standard space suits and do not have any of the safety features of the ACES as they are only to be used in space, thus do not need to be equipped with a survival pack or a parachute. The white color is also more conducive to a space environment as it reflect sunlight thus helping to prevent excessive heating from sunlight on the suit.

This quack peddles unproven radiological SPECT scanning of vulnerable people's brains (at $5,000+ per session) to identify various mental health issues, then 'cure' them with his own line of overpriced vitamins and supplements of questionable quality, which of course have no proof of efficacy.

Amen's PBS infomercials, which feature him pushing self-produced books and videos, encourage individuals with mental health issues to call his clinics for a free consultation; however, they're actually calling a boiler room-type call center, the consultants have zero training in the mental health field, and their only goal is using high-pressure sales tactics to get mentally vulnerable and unstable callers to book a SPECT scan, regardless of their ailments. If the caller can't afford a scan, they try to sell them supplements, which of course come with monthly auto-ship subscriptions.

Amen, whose psychiatry degree came from now-defunct Oral Roberts University, is aided and abetted by his sidekick Parris Kidd, whose PhD (Zoology) comes from a Caribbean diploma mill. 

The exploitation of people in mental and emotional crisis is abhorrent in the extreme. Amen's claims of 'curing' ADHD, autism, Alzhemier's, and myriad other mental health issues are dangerous fallacies that play squarely into the laughable ""What Big Pharma / Doctors / the medical industrial complex / etc. doesn't want you to know"" conspiracy mentality.

They aren't. Virtual particles are lines whose vertices are both in the Feynman diagram. Feynman diagrams are used in perturbation theory to calculate particle interactions (or more accurately, the probability of a particle scattering per unit solid angle). A Feynman diagram is one term in the series for a calculation.

Already we can see a problem with taking virtual particles as real: Which Feynman diagram is the actual one that's happening? This isn't a superposition. This is a sum. If each term in the sum paints a different picture of reality, but all terms contribute to the reality of the situation, what do you take as real? If you have a sum that says 1+2+3+…+100, which number is the answer? Obviously, the answer is ""none of them"". The answer is 5050.

Which brings me to [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/ijljd1/the_kalam_cosmological_argument_is_flawed/g6wjd4j) disaster of a comment chain. I'll admit I fall prey to Someone is Wrong on the Internet^(TM) often. This is simply one of the cases.

The [paper cited](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/15858/1/Jaeger%20Are%20Virtual%20Particles%20Less%20Real_%20entropy-21-00141-v3.pdf) (warning: PDF) in the linked comment states that:

&gt;Several reasons are then provided for considering virtual particles real, such as their descriptive, explanatory, and predictive value, and a clearer characterization of virtuality—one in terms of intermediate states—that also applies beyond perturbation theory is provided.

I don't see much of a reason to call them ""virtual *particles*"", since such intermediate quantum states are not necessarily, and very often not particle-like. In that sense, what Jaeger refers to as ""virtual particles"" is different from what physicists call ""virtual particles"".

Next, the Scientific American article by Gordon Kane is mentioned. The article has been repeatedly referred to on r/askphysics as ""a cancer upon the internet"" by particle physicists and quantum field theorists, so that should tell you how much credence to give it.

As I've mentioned in the comment chain, Kane uses the fact that we use virtual particles to calculate the Lamb shift in the spectrum of hydrogen as evidence for their (actual, physical) existence. But this isn't how logic works. To show that virtual particles actually exist, one must show that they exist in *all* calculations, not just one. One counterexample is sufficient to disprove it. The fact that we don't use virtual particles in lattice QCD disproves his case. In fewer words: The virtual particle picture has been falsified, in the sense of Karl Popper.

Next, it is claimed that virtual particles are ""a simple consequence of the uncertainty principle"" and that they are ""created then destroyed in a short time frame"". The only place I've seen the energy-time uncertainty principle used is in the decays of (real) particles. And in incorrect explanations of Hawking radiation, but since they are incorrect, I won't count them.

It is also claimed that these virtual particles ""could even [be made] long lived by separating them using lasers"". This doesn't tell us anything. Whether or not virtual particles are real, putting energy into a quantum field creates particles.

The effects of such ""virtual particles"" are then claimed to be detectable, via citation of [this paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6259/420). [This article](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/vacuum-fluctuations-experimental-practice/) addresses that claim:

&gt;But let us look at their experimental findings. On closer reading of the paper one finds that what fluctuates in the experiment is the electro-optical signal detected, not the vacuum. The electro-optical signal is the only thing measured, and it exhibits fluctuations. Thus what is measured are fluctuations of the signal, not of the vacuum.
&gt;
&gt;…
&gt;
&gt;The vacuum (whose fluctuations were allegedly observed) appears only indirectly – in spite of the title of the paper and the advertisement in the abstract -, namely in the form of a theoretical contribution to the variance of this signal in eq. (7), denoted `\Delta\overline{E}_{vac}^{2}`. This contribution, defined in eq. (4), is of the form ⟨X⟩, where X can be read off from eq. (4) to be a sum of squares of Fourier components of the electric field, with the ensemble expectation taken in the ground state of the radiation field. The latter is referred to as the vacuum. A casual reader of *Science* – not being an expert in quantum optics – is likely to imagine that the vacuum is a region of space devoid of matter and radiation but, indoctrinated by popular stories, filled with quantum fluctuations. Unfortunately, it is not stated in this paper where this vacuum is located: The putative vacuum appears nowhere in the description of the experimental set-up. One concludes that it does not take part in the experiment, except figuratively. How is this possible?
&gt;
&gt;…
&gt;
&gt;From the causal perturbation theoretic treatment it is clear and mathematically undisputable that everything experimentally measurable about photons, electrons, and positrons (and with appropriate extensions, also everything else) is expressible in terms of vacuum expectation values. Therefore explaining something as a consequence of hypothetical vacuum fluctuations because certain vacuum expectations occur in the quantum mechanical formula used for its calculation explains nothing, since vacuum expectations occur in all quantum field calculations, as long as they are done in a perturbation theoretic setting.

Next, [this article](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190710103223.htm). The paper is about plasma physics and fusion reactors. Evidently, not a vacuum. And apparently does not contain anything said in the popular science article.

Now, [the Caltech lecture notes on the Casimir effect](https://www.hep.caltech.edu/~phys199/lectures/lect5_6_cas.pdf) undermine itself, as there is no mention of virtual particles at all during the derivation of the Casimir force. The figure provided also undermines the point that it is to be understood in terms of virtual particles, as what they've illustrated are waves. Vibrational modes, to be precise. The energy density between the plates is lower than that outside, which one would struggle to explain if what is actually there are particles. On the other hand, waves are naturally excluded from regions if the regions do not admit integer multiples of their wavelength.

As for *A Universe From Nothing*, I don't think it needs further refutation than [this review](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/a-universe-from-nothing-by-lawrence-m-krauss.html) by David Albert:

&gt;According to relativistic quantum field theories, particles are to be understood, rather, as specific arrangements of the fields. Certain ­arrangements of the fields, for instance, correspond to there being 14 particles in the universe, and certain other arrangements correspond to there being 276 particles, and certain other arrangements correspond to there being an infinite number of particles, and certain other arrangements correspond to there being *no particles at all*. And those last arrangements are referred to, in the jargon of quantum field theories, for obvious reasons, as “vacuum” states. Krauss seems to be thinking that these vacuum states amount to the relativistic-­quantum-field-theoretical version of there *not being any physical stuff at all*. And he has an argument — or thinks he does — that the laws of relativistic quantum field theories entail that vacuum states are unstable. And that, in a nutshell, is the account he proposes of why there should be something rather than nothing.
&gt;
&gt;But that’s just not right. Relativistic-quantum-field-theoretical vacuum states — no less than giraffes or refrigerators or solar systems — are particular arrangements of *elementary physical stuff*. The true relativistic-quantum-field-­theoretical equivalent to there not being any physical stuff at all isn’t this or that particular arrangement of the fields — what it is (obviously, and ineluctably, and on the contrary) is the simple *absence* of the fields!

After which, my interlocutor devolves into a series of ""oh you think you're smarter than everyone in the scientific establishment, huh?"" while completely ignoring the fact that my argument was, and always has been, that virtual particles are a useful calculational tool and nothing more, and the fact that they are mentioned in papers simply means they are a useful calculational tool, and nothing more.",True,False,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,26904.0,public,self,Bad science: Virtual particles are real,0.0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/j213o4/bad_science_virtual_particles_are_real/,,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dark,,,,,,bc3e1cf2-f6aa-11e4-94dd-0e967552239b,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In their other example analysis, two findings on name-based racial discrimination are investigated. [Bertrand &amp; Mullainathan’s (2004)](https://replicationnetwork.com/2016/09/15/famous-aer-article-on-racial-discrimination-fails-to-replicate-why/) had two key conclusions: applicants with distinctively black names (1) were less likely to be called back and (2) benefited less from having a higher-quality resumé. Simonsohn *et al.* found (1) robust, while (2) barely significant (at the traditional 5% confidence level).

In this collection of links, most of the content is either really old or talking about how textbooks use the idea of race and don’t question it ( I assume this looks good for them but each of the studies they linked about race being used in textbooks says that this needs to be updated as it is obsolete.)

But what caught my eye were 3 articles in particular:


https://archive.fo/yEDgc

This one is from 2020 and says it’s a survey of expert opinion on topics including intelligence and controversial topics, and it apparently concludes that experts believe genes to be responsible for 50% of the IQ gap between blacks and whites?


https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1548-1433.2009.01076.x

Then there is this one, which says as recently as 2009 in eastern and western europe half physical anthropologists agree that race exists. Now this was puzzling to me because the AAA and AAPA both say that race is a fiction.

What should I make of this.

&gt;""I disagree emphatically that gender, as a concept, is distinct from sex.  That’s a modern construct that was never, repeat, NEVER a major issue until the rise of the feminist and LGBTBBQWTF brigades.  In order to be precise, let’s look at a dictionary definition ""

Fallacy alert! 
https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_dictionarium

Other dictionaries make this point:
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gender

&gt;&gt;""Among those who study gender and sexuality, a clear delineation between sex and gender is typically prescribed, with sex as the preferred term for biological forms, and gender limited to its meanings involving behavioral, cultural, and psychological traits. In this dichotomy, the terms male and female relate only to biological forms (sex), while the terms masculine/masculinity, feminine/femininity, woman/girl, and man/boy relate only to psychological and sociocultural traits (gender). This delineation also tends to be observed in technical and medical contexts, with the term sex referring to biological forms in such phrases as sex hormones, sex organs, and biological sex. But in nonmedical and nontechnical contexts, there is no clear delineation, and the status of the words remains complicated. ""

So yeah...
&gt;""For gender-reveal parties to operate on the basis of medical and scientific reality, rather than wishful thinking, seems to me to be no more than a recognition of the real facts of life.""

Easy to say with your nonscientific definition of sex and gender.

You should look here because gender is more than chromosomes:

I'm no neurologist but my understanding of the scientific consensus is that there is no genetic IQ differences between races. Despite this, the idea still persists. That makes sense in a world with the internet, we also have anti-vaxeers and flat-earthers.

What confuses me is how you have educated far-right intellectuals who obviously have very radical and flawed world-views, but world views that are nonetheless still mostly rational and at the very least understandable. I am in a lot of radical online communities because I find them interesting from a by-standers point of view I guess and there are well educated people there. I can see where most of their ideas come from though obviously disagree with them. But then out of nowhere they'll subtly throw in some comment about genetic race differences like it's nothing. Now I'll be honest, there was a time where I thought ""there has to be some truth behind this claim, otherwise why would they all claim it!"" but after doing research I discovered this was not the truth at all...

So I honestly don't understand it. I know you could easily dismiss this with ""all far-righters are just idiots trying to feel superior"" or something but I find that hard to believe. These people are honestly confident that they've cracked the code about all human society. Maybe I'm too optimistic when it comes to humans.

Homophobia is a hatred of gays, not heterosexuality. I am calling you a bigot for lying about gays.

&gt;Our side, I would remind you, is the overwhelming majority of all men - well over 95% of us are straight as a ruler, given that only about 4% of the general population is homosexual and vanishingly smaller numbers are part of the whole LGBTWTFISTHIS menagerie in the various other flavours of that particular sandwich.

Being pro gay isn't being anti straight. Enough with the false dilemma.

When Gay Pride month came around in 2016 and 2017, we were given little paper placards that we could display in our cubicles, proclaiming ourselves to be an ""ALLY"" of the LGBT movement. The more ""virtuous"" of us would display two or even three placards. (Like my last boss before I was let go, for instance - my opinions about him are well known by this point.)

&gt;My previous employer did something similar with a survey that they sent around in 2017. Needless to say, I dumped the placard into the bin and deleted that survey link right out of my inbox.

&gt;The idea that corporate America is not in thrall to the Rainbow Mafia is so ridiculous as to be unworthy of comment by this point.

&gt;""That Salon article you linked to did not demonstrate that Ben Shapiro failed to ""humiliate"" a trans-woman (read: man) who calls himself ""Zoey Tur"". All he did was state openly that Zoey Tur is a man.""

So he was being an ass about it.

&gt;If you watch a video clip of Little Benny's ""failed attempt"" to ""humiliate"" Mr. Tur, you will realise very quickly that the one who came across as an ass was the tranny.

&gt;That this is even open to question simply shows how degraded the Western world has become. Every single cell in Mr. Tur's body says that he is male, because he was born with an X-Y chromosomal pair. He might be mentally deluded enough to call himself a woman, but that does not make him one.""

&gt;&gt;In other words, the only distinction between being a drag queen, a fairy, and a man with severe mental issues is FEELZ.""

Sounds like you didn't think it was a distinction considering the tone here.

In fact if you showed my full original comment people could see that I quoted you vertibram

&gt;""My reference to Robin Baker's book had nothing to do with the link to the reddit post that you provided as an ""argument"". You attempt to discredit the whole book by looking at a few specific things that the authors got wrong - which, by the way, I will be happy to concede that they did.

&gt;What I was referring to, on the other hand, comes along much later in the book, and has to do with how gay men and women behave. That has nothing to do with whether or not men produce ""blocker"" and ""killer"" and ""egg-getter"" sperm.""

So they get so much wrong but you still trust them? Off course you ignore what he really said about gays: https://robin-baker.com/books/sperm-wars/status/#Homo

What did you say? https://donotlink.it/ErbOl
&gt;&gt;Homosexual couples, depending on the specific type involved (male-male or female-female), essentially act like extreme examples of the phenotypes upon which they are based. In simple terms, this means that male homosexuals generally act like extremely oversexed men, and female homosexuals act like extremely undersexed women. (I'm generalising significantly, obviously.) This observation has been borne out in several studies and was documented extensively in Robin Baker's groundbreaking classic Sperm Wars.

...why lie? He makes no such claims in his book

&gt;&gt;Neither extreme is healthy for young children. A household in which sexual promiscuity is normal is unlikely to result in normal children. A household in which there is no strong father figure present is unlikely to generate masculine sons or feminine daughters- as we have seen, repeatedly, in normal households the world over. A household with lesbian parents in which it is highly likely that one of the two partners involved is abusive toward the other, whether physically, mentally, emotionally, or all three, is NOT going to be a healthy environment for a child.

One,gays being promiscuous is an horrible exaggeration: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.indy100.com/article/a-new-study-has-debunked-one-of-the-worst-misconceptions-about-gay-men-and-sex--ZJgoq0cO_W%3famp

Second, gay parents don't raise kids to be gay: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.lehmiller.com/blog/2012/9/28/5-myths-about-homosexuality-debunked-by-science.html%3fformat=amp

Likewise single parents in general are bad for raising kids. 

Finally you are wrong about how to raise kids to follow gender norms: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/580366/


One that needs to end: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0178534

&gt;""From the perspective of us normal people, we do not like your lifestyle and do not approve of it. We tolerate it as long as you keep it out of our faces and do not insist on special rights to legitimise your degeneracy. That tolerance has its limits, and you are going to find that out one way or another, very likely the hard way, if you insist on continuing to ram your rainbow agenda down our throats. We don't like it and we will not stand for it.""

What do you think you know about gays? http://homoresponse.blogspot.com/2011/06/mental-health-and-substance-abuse.html

The link above presents extensive scientific evidence for the link between heterosexism/minority stress and a key LGBT health disparity which it impacts. These same disparities are frequently cited by heterosexists to demonstrate that the ""homosexual lifestyle"" is risky, unhealthy or dangerous. Ironically, given that heterosexism itself causes these disparities, rather than homosexuality, such criticisms are not only flawed but additionally, hypocritical and counter-productive.

&gt;""Let's see if you can follow this simple logical syllogism:""

Which doesn't match what we see in reality? 
https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-wellbeing-of-children-with-gay-or-lesbian-parents/

&gt;""I am aware of the problems with the Regnerus study about children raised by gay parents. Unfortunately for you, I mentioned nothing about that study in my post - and in fact that study has very little to do with the context of my statement.""

Other than you are making the same mistakes Renguers made with his study. Thinking single parent outcomes can be applied to other family structures beyond ""traditional"" 

&gt;""The first leg of that stool is empirically rigourous and well known. The second leg is a plain and simple fact. The third leg follows naturally through straightforward deduction.""

The first leg is another fallacy also made by Renguers.

&gt;Furthermore, I did not state or even imply that single mothers are the same as a couple. Again, look at the syllogism above. It's very straightforward.

Yeah but all you data on fatherless couples come from single mothers
Remember?

https://donotlink.it/NjNQk
""The consequences of children, especially boys, being raised by single mothers are well known and well understood by now- and they are disastrous.""

And as the data show companies gay or lesbian couples to say single mothers, is like apples to oranges.

But your syllogism goes first:

&gt;Children raised without fathers are statistically likely to have serious social and economic problems in later life.

Same without mothers either: https://brandongaille.com/19-compelling-motherless-children-statistics/

In other words having a single parent only is the problem!

&gt;Three women were ""married"" together into a ""throuple"" with no male presence involved in a parenting role.

&gt;Therefore, any children born or adopted into such an arrangement are likely to have significant social and economic problems later in life

Nope: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-polyamorists-next-door/201806/myths-about-polyamory

Here you go again comparing single parents to couples. Saying ""children need a father"" is wrong here.

Need to go on a tangent for context: 
https://donotlink.it/5MaNG
&gt;&gt;It is usually at this point that someone would attempt to counteract Ms. Barwick's arguments, based entirely on anecdotal evidence, by attempting to drown out such horrendous badthink by shouting about how THE SCIENCE IS SETTLED!!! about gay parents having no more negative effects on the cognitive and social development of children than straight ones. They resort to this line of argument because, well, it's the only one that they have. (Well, that, and the movie The Kids Are Alright, which I have not watched and almost certainly never will.)

&gt;&gt;They do this because it is the only way in which they can ensure that their FEELZ will remain unhurt by such chaotic badthink- how dare we cretinous knuckle-dragging mouth-breathing homophobic right-wing nutjobs question the idea that gay parents are just as good as straight ones?!!

&gt;&gt;Except... it turns out that the science is not settled. (Sounds familiar, doesn't it?)

&gt;""That isn't my view - that's the WHO's view, and the CDC is calling the spread of HIV/AIDS an ""epidemic"". Since gay men, and specifically injectable-using gay men, are driving the vast majority of new infections, the conclusion follows naturally.""

The CDC also says that stigma and discrimination is a big factor: https://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/stigma-and-discrimination.htm

Same with the WHO: https://www.paho.org/blz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79:un-countries-must-eliminate-homophobia-curb-hiv-epidemic-latin-america-caribbean&amp;Itemid=213

&gt;Right, here are the relevant quotes from the link:

You mean this one? http://homoresponse.blogspot.com/2011/05/countering-heterosexist-arguments.html?m=1#08

&gt;&gt; Studies suggest that about 25% of homosexual males do not have anal sex, though representative lifetime prevalence rates are very hard to find:

&gt;&gt;- In a U.S. survey, 50% of men who had had a same-sex partner since age 18 had never had anal sex (Laumann et al. 1994, ""The Social Organization of Sexuality"" table 8.6, p318).
- The authors of the same study noted that ""20-25 percent of the narrowest categorization of the men report never having had anal intercourse"" (p320), regarding table 8.6.
- A large Scottish study found that 25% of MSM had no anal sex in the past year, despite it recruiting from gay bars (Hart et al. 1999, Sexually Transmitted Infections, 75(4), 242–246, table 2, p244).
- A CDC survey that also recruited from clubs/bars found that 38.8% of MSM reported not having had anal sex in the preceeding 6 months in 1997 (CDC MMWR Weekly, January 29, 1999 48(03):45-48).
- 37% of the MSM in the Young Men's Health Study reported no receptive anal intercourse in the last year. No data is readily available for insertive anal intercourse.  (Osmond et al. 1994, American Journal of Public Health, 84(12), 1933–1937, p1935).

Seems you forgot to mention these...why?

&gt;""First, these estimates are questionable to begin with. The CDC's data are based on a special tabulation done by the NCHS, not on raw data. Other sources put the prevalence of anal sex among MSM - men who have sex with men, which is a superset of the population of outright gay and bisexual men - at about 90%, and at 5-10% among sexually active women.""

Again msm is not the same as homosexual orientation. Your link doesn't even say that msm is a superset of the gay and bisexual population.
https://www.webmd.com/sex/anal-sex-health-concerns#1
And off course data needs to be tabulated! https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/key_statistics/s.htm#analsex

It doesn't change the data! It puts it into a chart! https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/tabulate
What is ""raw data"" to you?

&gt;""This alone illustrates why the Appeal To Authority is such an irritating and stupid debate tactic; you can find virtually any factoids you want to support your argument, but if they are not backed up by clear deductive or inductive logic as well, they are empty"" 

Like what you just did? Because you also didn't consider how often gays have anal sex: https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/how-do-men-and-women-prepare-to-bottom-for-anal-sex/

Far less than you think.

&gt;""Moreover, if we look at the quotes from the cited studies, the fact that men have anal sex with women has nothing to do with the question of whether homosexuality is wrong. The former is an empirical fact; the latter is a moral judgement. The latter can be supported by the former, but the former has nothing to do with the latter.""

Beyond raising the question why the double standard that we ignore hetero couples doing it but not gays? 

&gt;""Why do I consider homosexuality to be wrong and disgusting, particularly of the male kind? For several reasons - not least of which is the fact that the human body is not designed for anal sex.""

Neither is the female body. Indeed reducing sexual orientation to sexual behavior is faulty because they aren't the same: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_identity

https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/Sexuality-explained

&gt;&gt;Sexuality is not about who you have sex with, or how often you have it. Sexuality is about your sexual feelings, thoughts, attractions and behaviours towards other people. You can find other people physically, sexually or emotionally attractive, and all those things are a part of your sexuality.

Get it? Homosexual identity is attraction and has a purpose, alloparenting: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/147470491301100202

&gt;I didn't say that BMI is useless. I said that it is a problematic metric. As a very general guide, it has some uses, but for men like me, who work out frequently and have a decent amount of dense muscle, it does not apply very well.

&gt;It's not a ""double"" standard, it's just a standard standard. The distortions in BMI usually occur with people who have large amounts of dense muscle mass. That does not apply in the case of fat lesbians, or anyone else who is overweight/obese and does not have large amounts of muscle mass.

No the BMI is bs in general: 
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bmi-is-a-terrible-measure-of-health/
https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265215.php
It isn't just muscle mass that is a problem

&gt;Yet, overall, gay men act like women- the gay-fairy stereotype exists for a reason- and gay women act like men, as anyone who has ever had to deal with the distasteful aftermath of a gay pride rally has found out.

&gt;It is therefore unsurprising that gay men think that, like, they look totally fat in those jeans, darling- while gay women would be more interested in the donuts and Twinkies Danishes muffins pastries.

Really?

http://homoresponse.blogspot.com/2011/05/countering-heterosexist-arguments.html
And this feeds back into body shaming...https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0361684316635529?journalCode=pwqa

In other words, stigma is heavily tied to obesity as a cause in lesbians. It isn't because they are lesbians, thus fat as you think it is.

&gt;It is no surprise that Ms. Spataro’s attempts to become pregnant — “trying to have a baby the old-fashioned way” — are “complicated.” To begin with, both she and her, uh, partner had to stop taking synthetic hormones. Yes, in case you didn’t realize it, birth-control pills are synthetic hormones which prevent pregnancy by obstructing a woman’s normal hormone production. It is a well-known scientific fact that hormones influence mood and behavior, and it is therefore perhaps no coincidence that Queer Feminism flourishes among a generation of young women raised on “safe sex” ideology, many of whom began taking contraceptive pills as teenagers. What are the possible long-term consequences of deliberately causing an abnormal hormone-induced state of sterility in adolescent girls and young women?

1. Uses the Jinniushan woman as evidence of humans developing in Asia. Now, the woman in question is probably one of the few examples of a derived looking sapiens skull from North Asia. the problem is the body type [doesn't match up](http://www1.udel.edu/PR/Messenger/05/02/ancient.html).

&gt;The team found that the fossil shows not only that the skeleton’s relative brain size fits the model of increasing brain size during the Middle Pleistocene throughout the human range, but also that the skeleton’s body proportions reflect a pattern of climatic adaptation that persists to the present day.  
&gt;  
&gt;The report states that the Jinniushan specimen shows that humans living around the cold region, which now is in northeastern China near North Korea, had large, broad bodies with short limbs to enable them to retain more heat.

Modern humans actually have rather Narrower bodies compared to archaic humans, making a Northern origin very unlikely. Part of the very derived nature of the skull as to do with the fact that it is [female](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinniushan#Description), therefore it will share many gracialized traited between even females of different populations compared to their male counterparts.

I encourage others however to review the [vast](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47813783_The_Late_Middle_Pleistocene_Hominin_Fossil_Record_of_Eastern_Asia_Synthesis_and_Review/citations) and Growing Middle Paleolithic finds from [China and Asia](https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/early-human-migrations/) and bring them up in the comments.

2. Uses the Liujang skull, whose dating is [suspect](https://donsmaps.com/liujiang.html) even by chinese scientists standards, is nonetheless found in Southern China. Even assuming and older date of 130-150k (which would be based on more unreliable contexts), it till would be Younger than Sapiens from East Africa (Herto or Omo Kibish) or the Middle East (Israel, 177-194k).

3. Brings up [Denisovans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denisovan#Anatomy), who anatomically speaking were very archaic. They also had a [wide pelvis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335934076_Reconstructing_Denisovan_Anatomy_Using_DNA_Methylation_Maps). Their skulls likewise are suggested to be very robust and true unmoderned, not ""round skulled"" as he suggests and would associate with modern humans.

4. Argues that Khoi-san are ""cold adapted"" when they are nothing of the sort, see the ""[facebook edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/hfinzu/more_bad_african_genetics_facebook_edition/)"" post I did on this sub. Cheekbones, eyelids, and Shovelling teeth (which are recent in East Asians) do not have any general relation with ""cold adaptation"". They, of all Africans, show the least affinity with Eurasians.

5. Argues Denisova Cave artifacts are more advanced than Blombos Cave, and that this is the root of modern human thinking. This is mainly due to a single bracelet, which nonetheless shows profound use of drilling, polishing, and refining not seen until the Neolithic.

The Problem, however, is that Drilling and polishing of shells and beads is also seen at Blombos, along with related sites like Sibudu ([among other technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibudu_Cave)) showing even earlier evidence of needles compared to the Denisova Cave.

The comparison of technology as a whole, which he doesn't even mention general toolkits, shows that Denisovan as a whole doesn't have a clear edge.

6. Worth noting, he rarely mentions actual mtdna genetics or autosomal genetics. Favors botched paleontology and archaeology, hence the title of this post.

It was dedicated to this [Youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_AUWVTo2HU), you did a very sketchy video that is titled ""Mota"" but actually has very little to do with the specimen itself.

To start off with, it cites a article by an Afrocentric publisher that claims SSA are the only ""pure humans"", something that couldn't be defended since 2015 roughly speaking. It never stops being a recurring theme that the bad science of these people/ ""skeptics"" are mainly reactionary responses to other bad ethnocentric science.

It alleges that Jebel Irhoud is a Hybrid of Archaic and modern Humans to represent the ""Ghost population"". However, this is a really unorthodox use of the specimen. One [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11213-w) did suggest it was a mix between Homo Sapiens and neanderthals, but mainly through exchange with Southern European Neanderthals rather than local African Archaics. A previous study suggested it's affinities to neanderthals is merely [unspecialization](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/1/eaao5961). Either way, the face of the specimen is divergent from Neanderthals.

He then attempts to demonstrate, using ancestry calculators, how much ""Denisovan and Neanderthal"" DNA is in Africans. The answer is little, mainly due to [back migration](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/africans-carry-surprising-amount-neanderthal-dna) when present. That's not what he found, however. This is mainly due to the oversimplistic nature of these calculators that weren't meant for such interpretations of archaic DNA in Africans. This obvious when you see the results of Denisovans, Altai neanderthal, or Taforalt. This simply doesn't suffice for results of actual studies one would use. 

A perfect example would be an ""African result"" of about 1/3 for a Sami individual (not sure how these calculators work) that he proposes is actually ""archaic"". Now, anyone who knows the Sami would know that they are not 1/3 neanderthal or even archaic. This is more likely the result of the calculator being misused.

For reference, such ideas he proposes are [somewhat true](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/7/eaax5097). however, the average is found here at 6-7% percent, the interval is 2% to 19% from the sample. While large, it's unlikely to explain such results seen above.

Next he proposes that Near-eastern related people (related to Natufarians that is) mixed with a Neanderthal ""cousin"" and became West Africans, despite that being over simplified as expressed many times before in understanding Autosomal genetics assuming an Eurasian origin for E. This would explain how such archaic ancestry is highest in HG who generally lack E.

Finally, we actually get to ""Mota"". He first claims that the retraction of the Eurasian results were do to a need to restrict the ""narrative"" even though various other studies on pastoral groups, Khoi-san and East Africans show that West Eurasian dna is present in SSA Africans. The retraction was the finding in Yoruba and Mbuti. [See here](http://anthromadness.blogspot.com/2016/01/the-mota-mistake.html) on the specific and how other people prior to the retraction pointed out issues. He falsely claims that it only applied it to North and North East Africans.

Claims that Mota is E-M29, and therefore is unlike the Y-Chromosome of Ari people, despite that specific type [being common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_E-M329) in modern SW Ethiopia.

Claims later that the major SSA component of E1b is ""Archaic"" in terms of autosomal profile, even though that is still incorrect. Claims that Hadza were related to Pygmies, when [genetically](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29608727/) they are not.

The rest are ponderings regarding E in Africa. Couldn't car less though, given how nonsensical it is.

To reinforce my point, see this comment.

&gt;Update on **E-M2** mutation, another blow to Afrocentrics, **M2** mutation with no known downstream mutations has now been found in Arabia and not west Africa nor East Africa nor South Africa, one of the new Arabian samples pushed back the date then previously thought, from TMRCA of 14800 ybp to 16300 ybp!  So out of all the Yoruba, all west Africans and Afro Americans that have been tested not one **M2\*** mutation has been found! What a blow!

&amp;#x200B;

[E-M2,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_E-M2) mind you, is one of the most common variant of E among West Africans. Not to mention he doesn't cite a study, so how specific he's trying to be is lost.

This guy is as dumb as they come.

Bonus: A [Shorter video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkhpXA65Z0M) he did explaining how ""Human evolution is pseudoscience"".

Claims there is no evidence for OOA, and shows a drawing of what is clearly Sapiens and calls it H. Erectus. (which he later uses to claim the ""bulb forehead"" is an archaic strait, which it is not. Procedes to show vastly different ethnic groups (Nilotes, Khoisan, and Onge HG) suggesting that they are related.

Suggest that they didn't find ""One modern skull"" to suggest Humanity came from ""black Africans"" (an obvious strawman). Except for the fact That [Homo Sapiens modern Behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klasies_River_Caves) (South Africa), Sapiens teeth (South Africa and Kenya such as Sibudu), Skulls (Jebel Irhoud, Omo Kibish, Herto, Aduma), and [Transitional fossils](http://in-africa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dominguez-Rodrigo-et-al-2008-JHE-new-Eyasi-fossil.pdf) (Laetoli, Florisbad, Eyasi) showing a more consistent and early appearance of Sapiens compared to other regions. 

Claims the ""negroid Phenotype"" originates with Pygmies and Khoi-san mixing with Erectus, despite the fact that such doesn't bear out in neither [genetics](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008552) for HG or [African phenotypes of these groups](https://www.academia.edu/3788868/The_Late_Peopling_of_Africa_According_to_Craniometric_Data._A_Comparison_of_Genetic_and_Linguistic_Models). Due to their gracile nature, HG are even further away to the elongated skulls of archaic hominids of compared to Bantu, who genetically are more derived that Hg populations.

And once again, repeats the idiotic assertion that E-males and Hg females created groups like Niger-Kongo speakers, even though  groups genetically closer to Eurasians like Dinka and Annuaks have less E than NK Speakers and more paternal haplogroups under A and B like Hunter-gatherers.

Mind you, she is dedicating this video to a [youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_AUWVTo2HU) who think the Sami scoring nearly a third of African ancestry on a shitty do it yourself Autosomal test is actually ""archaic"" ancestry since Africans are now known to have a ghost population that is usually found at 5%-8% **max**. A rate of 19% was found, but this ancestry  also linked to CEU samples at 2%, This is pretty consistent with the quality of science this general crowd of ""Anti-Hoteps"" mentioned so far. Will do a post on this guy later.

The claims will be divided into the following

1. Out of Africa is a ""lie"".
2. Haplogroup E comes from Eurasia (a possible and likely origin, but not exclusive option) along with other Haplogroup assertions not supportable from the study.
3. The overall Y-Chromosome tree is rooted in ""Eurasia"", and A&amp;B share alleles with CT.
4. The OOA event involved CT Eurasians similar to French and Chinese.
5. Admixture and Migrations didn't happen prior to 70k-80k.

But before we get into these claims, what does the actual study say? A commenter that actually read the study does a decent Job.

&gt;It’s a great moment for Eurasians, but hold on guys, let’s not get ahead of ourselves here.   
&gt;  
&gt;I read the study in its entirety and **the study recognizes the OOA theory and is not challenging OOA, it’s simply demonstrating that there was high migration into African populations from OOA descendants (non-Africans) and not high migration from the reverse during a certain time period (mainly the Late Middle Paleolithic).**   
&gt;  
&gt;It doesn’t mention haplogroups, so as it is always fun to speculate about haplogroups based on as much information as we can gather, **I can’t say this study has validated the argument I’ve seen put forth here about haplogroups or a defunct OOA.** I believe it is absolutely possible and quite probable that haplogroup E is part of the non-African ancestry that has significantly replaced 1/3 of the ancestry in many Africans and I truly believe that could be correct, **but I see no evidence of haplogroup confirmations here in this study so I won’t use this study to make any premature claims.** The study is saying something spectacular that we can indeed confirm, that African diversity is due to partial Eurasian gene replacement and admixture into the African populations before the Eurasian split and that around 1/3 of the ancestry of many Africans came from that (others a little less), so the Eurasian back migration started before we initially thought it did at 45-50kya. **It’s a phenomenal study and this information is groundbreaking, but it’s not a rebuttal to the OOA, it’s a Eurasian migration story in addition to the OOA, not in lieu of it and although it confirms massive Eurasian ancestry inferred into African populations during the Late Middle Paleolithic and possibly beyond that has replaced a third of the ancestry in many Africans, it doesn’t confirm that ancestry to be any particular haplogroup.** But indeed, it’s a groundbreaking study and great information from great work and this is a great video to watch and P7 thanks for bringing this study to more people than it would have reached without this video.

In agreement with these points are the fact that nowhere in the actual quotes used by the authors do we see OOA as ""debunked"", rather that OOA indeed occurred. Lets continue.

&amp;#x200B;

1. ""Out of Africa is a lie.

We already pointed that out by an actual commenter, but what from the actual study do we see?

&gt;We find that the method infers high rates of migration from descendants of the OoA event (’non-Africans’) to Africans, but not in the opposite direction, in the period 30–70kya corresponding to the Late Middle Paleolithic (Fig. 1). In populations from the Niger-Kordofanian and Nilo-Saharan language groups, comprising the majority of the population on the African continent, **the peak inferred migration rate from Eurasian populations (2.5–3.0⇥104 and 3.5–4.0⇥104, in units of proportion of the target (ancestral African) population replaced per generation) most frequently falls in the epochs spanning 35–45kya**, while peak migration rates **in the opposite direction are substantially lower (0.5-1.0 ⇥ 104) and occur earlier, in the epochs spanning 55–70kya (Supplemental Fig. S1).**

So, the OOA event was detected and is earlier than the man periods of geneflow that is discussed in this paper. Given how OOA involved a Bottleneck, it's detection being weaker isn't much of a surprise.

2. The origins of E were discussed last time with E7, but this study at best is consistent with a scenario of geneflow guiding E into Africa assuming a Eurasian origin. Nowehere are haplogroup phylogenies discussed.

3. Same point as before, this study says nothing on Y Haplogroups. To place a ""Eurasian"" Root due to A and B ""sharing alleles"" with CT is asinine. Not only do the populations with the highest amounts of these haplogroups (Pygmies and Khoi-san) are shown to be the least affected by the migration, but these haplogroups are know to be NOT derived from Ct based on mutations. E7's point here is just bizarre.

4. Technically misleading. The inference is that the population that contributed to Africans pre-dated Eurasian diversification as we know now. Therefore they would likely resemble neither.

5. The study doesn't rule out earlier migration or admixture, rather that it's tools have an inherent limitation of detection, and that the date of 70k is useful as a upper bound for the admixture discussed in the study.

E7 in the comments-

&gt; There is more evidence for into Africa than out of Africa.  

Well, depending on how you define this, this is true mainly due to said ""Into Africa"" migrations being Younger (thus easier to detect which applies to this case). Otheriwse, the basic OOA origin of humans isn't contradicted here.

&gt;Black Africans are the most diverse because they are the most admixed.  

Technically true.

&gt;The population that existed at the time of OOA would have resembled something prior to the split of Europeans and East Asians.  One of the earliest skulls at around 55kya found at Manot cave in the Levant is said to resemble later Europeans.  

True, but it was also found to resemble the African skull of Aduma which is dated to be around 60-90k.

&gt;After the supposed OOA event, a population ancestral to sub-Saharans acquired ghost genetics at \~35kya.  Probably admixture with an Erectus or Erectus-like population holdover that may have survived up to about 10kya “Iwo Eleru “ in west Africa (I think paper by Havarti and Stringer).  

Iwo eleru isn't ""Erectus"" but close to Archaic Sapiens such as Laetoli. As far as divergence dates for the autosomal DNA in Africans, it typically dates either before or slightly after the split with Neanderthals. See here in this [guest post ](https://notpoliticallycorrect.me/2019/05/14/reviewing-ancient-sub-structure-in-modern-sub-saharans/) I did on the subject of African substructure.

&gt;Peoples prior to 35kya didn’t have this component, only black Africans do, as well as the MUC7 gene which is not found in Non-African populations.  Eurasians migrated into Africa bringing haplogroup E mutations which were introduced into this Erectus/Erectus-like population and the black African is the result of that encounter.  Probably  female Pygmy as well.

As discussed in a previous post, simple statements like this is oversimplified. Such [archaic admixture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7082067/) is low, and such ancient Eurasian admixture is only a third of SSA DNA. Female pygmies, BTW, can't explain the Yoruba. Basically, Sapiens was likely present in the region prior to 35k.

The bad science quote comes here:

&gt; “When you have a person who has the lack of pigment, the lack of melanin that they know they will be annihilated, therefore they know that however they got the power, they have a lack of compassion, melanin comes with compassion,”
&gt;
&gt;“Melanin comes with soul, that we call it soul, we soul brothers and sisters, that’s the melanin that connects us so the people that don’t have it, are, and I’m going to say this carefully, are a little less and where the term actually comes from, and I’m going to bring it back around to Minister Farrakhan, where they may not have the compassion,”
&gt;
&gt;“When they were sent to the Mountains of Caucasus, they didn’t have the power of the sun. The sun started to deteriorate them. So, they’re acting out of fear, they’re acting out of low self-esteem, they’re acting out of deficiency, so therefore the only way they can act is evil,”

I shouldn't have to delve too deep into why melanin, a protein, is [a product of the oxidation of tyrosine and later polymerization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanogenesis) and doesn't ""come from compassion"". 

I also shouldn't have to explain that there's zero connection between the levels of melanin in someone's skin (or maybe the whole body) and how ""compassionate"" a human is.

But it's not that Nick Cannon invented this out of thin air. This theory that melanin is somehow special and makes black people (and brown people, one assumes) superior comes from an Afrocentrist book called [*The Isis Papers: The Keys to the Colors (1991)*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/696980.The_Isis_Papers), by black-American psychiatrist and civil rights leader Frances Cress Welsing. This isn't a scientific book but it gave way to a theory called [**melanin theory**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ajpa.1330360604), which is popular among several black academics. According to this theory, white people are inferior to black people because many of their ""traits"", like skin color, are recessive against ""black traits"". Melanin theory proponents believe that melanin gives them [""physical and intellectual superiority"" over white people](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,157721,00.html).

That's where Nick Cannon likely found about this theory. But it isn't something that he found in the deep web or in racist black supremacist forums: Afrocentric ideas are doing just fine in many American colleges nowadays, especially in their African Studies departments and HBCUs.  Frances Cress Welsing was a teacher at Howard University. Leonard Jeffries, one of its proponents, was a long time professor in City College of New York. Na'im Akbar taught in Norfork University and Florida State. [*The Isis Papers* is still a book read in several Black History Studies courses across the US universities.](https://hbculifestyle.com/black-history-books-hbcu/).

I've noticed that there have been a lot of Youtube ads lately that say that certain products are bad because they have ingredients with long names. In the past few months, I've seen ads for vitamins, deodorant, body wash, makeup, and shampoo that do this, so it seems to be a trend.

Why the ad I linked is bad science:

1. Honestly, it's hard to respond to because unlike some of the other ads I've seen, it doesn't give any reasons for why Disodium Distyrylbiphenyl Disulfonate is bad to have in laundry detergent. The guy in the ad literally says, ""Yeah, I don't know either,"" so props for honesty I guess. The closest the ad comes to giving a reason for why it's bad is when he implies that it's an unnecessary chemical and says that 7th Generation Laundry Detergent contains ""no unnecessary chemicals.""

So let's respond to that point: First, every ingredient in laundry detergent, everything that makes up clothes, and every physical item involved in the process of doing laundry is a chemical. Yes, even the [ingredients in 7th Generation detergent are chemicals.](https://www.seventhgeneration.com/sites/default/files/2019-12/22769svg50ozlaundrybottlefreeandclearback-2100x2100-8b6534ca-60c8-4279-b0df-cb30a0880709.jpg) Second, from what I have managed to find, Disodium Distyrylbiphenyl Disulfonate is an [optical brightener](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/optical-brightener), which [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_brightener), is added to make clothing appear cleaner and to avoid it having a yellowish appearance, the yellowish appearance being off-putting to customers. So, in the sense that that this chemical helps clothing to not appear yellowish, it's a ""necessary chemical.""

2. I can't find any information suggesting that having Disodium Distyrylbiphenyl Disulfonate in laundry detergent is harmful to people who use that detergent to wash their clothes.  Now, the ad doesn't claim that it's harmful, but I'm making that point in case it was meant to imply that. This page says that [it doesn't cause serious and irreversible effects on people's health or on the environment](https://www.whatsinproducts.com/chemicals/view/1/4359), and this page also says that it [has little to no harmful environmental effects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/optical-brightener). 

It's also important to point out that, based on the detergents that have a listed concentration,[it has a concentration of 0.1-1%](https://www.whatsinproducts.com/chemicals/view/1/4359) depending on the brand, so it's a pretty small concentration. 

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr** I can't find any evidence suggesting that it's unnecessary or harmful to have Disodium Distyrylbiphenyl Disulfonate in laundry detergent.

http://blog.secularprolife.org/2016/12/more-evidence-that-most-late-term.html?m=1

At 34 weeks, a healthy fetus has a 98+% of surviving if delivered alone. Sometimes, if a pregnant person goes into labor at 34 weeks, they won’t try to prevent them from delivering because fetal/neonatal prognosis is so good and the survival rate is so high.

A user on here claims to have gone to Warren Hern’s clinic and got a 34 week abortion. She was healthy, and the fetus was healthy. She just didn’t know she was pregnant until 33 weeks.

They even posted paperwork.

I have OCD and unfortunately I’m in too deep to make the obsessive analysis stop for now. I was wondering if anyone could clarify this for me upon browsing rational wiki: 

“genetic data does show that random people sampled from within a population are generally more similar to each other than a pair sampled from different populations.“

^Accompanied by a citation from the Witherspoon 2007 paper. But the same paper also states:

“It is also compatible with our finding that, even when the most distinct populations are considered and hundreds of loci are used, individuals are frequently more similar to members of other populations than to members of their own population”

Is this paradoxical or am I missing something? (How can we be more similar within populations but more similar to other populations?) For reference this is under the ‘racialism’ section of the rational wiki page

Right from the start we are asked to accept two presumptive nature's of reality which have not been proven. First we must believe that there are other universes beside our own. 

We have theories that are backed by mathematics, that I admittedly do not understand, that explain how other universes could exist in theory. The issue is there is no way to prove or disprove these hypotheses. 

The possibility of me having a porche in the driveway does not break the laws of physics but that in itself does not make it a reality.

The truth of the matter is (no pun intended) we don't even know what amount of space the observable universe takes up in our own universe. We know that it's expanding, but what is it expanding into? There are limits to how small something can be, like a point particle. Could there also be limits to how large something could be? We do not know. 

So to say with such certainty that our universe is unexeptionable when our universe may be the only universe, thus rendering it, by its very nature, the MOST exceptional seems like a rather grandious and arrogant statement coming from a human. For all we know our observable universe may be like a point particle compared to the rest of the universe. 

Second, let's presume that there are other universes wandering in the ether of which we don't understand. we are then asked to believe that these other universes have different laws of physics than our own. 

Someone please explain to me why our mathematics which are based solely on our laws of physics would ever point to laws outside of its own domain? This in itself would break the laws of Physics. The act of predicting with mathematics something which is not possible within that mathmatecial framework is impossible.

Third, this idea ignores the even larger question of ""why is there something rather than nothing."" Even if there are multiple universes and those universes do have different laws of physics. Why are those universes there in the first place. Who created God? 

Now follow me on this one, by saying that our reality is inconsequential and average blindly ignores that if there is a reality outside of our own reality then we now live in a reality where that reality is a reality making it our reality.

A. The author- Patrick Frank has mostly been known as an occasional contributor to Watts Up With That. Besides that he does have high secondary education in Chemistry with a PhD from Stanford, but besides that, I have not found anything that suggest he has expertise in a field related to climate science. [https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/674609/bio](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/674609/bio) 

B. The style of the paper- Often times, this is how you can differentiate a paper that is motivated from bad faith and would only make it an open access journal. There are several instances throughout the paper where Frank implies an ""unavoidable conclusion"". In the beginning of the paper, he uses the phrase, The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (UN IPCC)"" which is a name given from skeptics who argue the fictional would government narrative, rather than just the IPCC as an academic reference would. Even if not politically or personally biased, the language is pretty sloppy. He says the IPCC has predicted that by the year 2100 unabated human emissions of CO2 could cause an increase in global averaged surface air temperatures (GASAT) by about 3 Celsius. The IPCC has predicted a 1.5 to 4 degC temperature rise for a doubling of CO2 concentration from pre-industrial levels, based on a range of research papers. [https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5\_Chapter12\_FINAL.pdf](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter12_FINAL.pdf) [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01125-x](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01125-x)

So what are ""unabated"" human emissions? How much is that?  

In a post Patrick Frank wrote to WUWT, he says

**""Before going further, my deep thanks to Anthony Watts for giving a voice to independent thought. So many have sought to suppress it (freedom denialists?). His gift to us (and to America) is beyond calculation. And to Charles the moderator, my eternal gratitude for making it happen.""** [https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/09/07/propagation-of-error-and-the-reliability-of-global-air-temperature-projections-mark-ii/](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/09/07/propagation-of-error-and-the-reliability-of-global-air-temperature-projections-mark-ii/)

and continues a pretty passive aggressive rant on climate modelers and the ""status quo"" behind AGW science. Is he right?

C. The article content- (credit to Atomsk's Sanakan)-  Frank is incorrectly categorizing the cloud error in climate models. He's adding a ""per time"" part to the error estimate for cloud responses in climate models, even though he's been repeatedly told by dozens of experts that it does not belong there, nor does the source he's abusing place it there (despite his Frank's false claim to the contrary). Since he now has a ""per time"" unit in the error, he accumulated that by the time across which the model is run. So, for example, if the model is run for 50 years, and since Frank added a ""per year"" unit to the error, then he accumulates that error each year, allowing him to increase the error as the model progresses forward for 50 years. Hence him being able to explode the size of error in model-based projections overtime. You can see the effect of that in figure 6B of his paper, versus what competent experts show the error to be in figure 6A. 

D. Closing- In the Watts Up With That article cited above, Frank reveals that he's submitted the paper for peer review about 10 times over the course of 6 years and has been rejected. He blames hive-mind, censorship, and status quo for dismissing any contrary evidence. Realistically, it just wasn't a good study, so he paid for the paper to be published in Frontiers in Earth Science and also was not associated with Stanford University, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, or the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource.

Academic research on climate change leading to global warming has been known and accepted since the early 1900s [https://www.carbonbrief.org/media/419111/fig5.png](https://www.carbonbrief.org/media/419111/fig5.png) 
2. As Earth’s temperature grew exponentially since recordings began in 1880, there was a noticeable slow down to decrease between the 1940s through 1970s. But exponential increase continued at the end of the 1970s. [https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/21/why-does-the-temperature-record-shown-on-your-vital-signs-page-begin-at-1880/](https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/21/why-does-the-temperature-record-shown-on-your-vital-signs-page-begin-at-1880/) 
3. So what happened between the 1940s and 1970s? Skeptics argue that the up and down nature of global temperature is evidence of natural climate progression. However, climate needs an external forcing for it to change, it cannot change of its own will, especially at the rate it did over the mid 20th century and exponential warming from the early 20th century continued into today. 
4. What caused the cooling in this era was the increase in sulphate aerosols, which reflect incoming solar energy back into space and lead to cooling. This increase was the result of two sets of events. Industrial activities picked up following the Second World War. This, in the absence of pollution control measures, led to a rise in aerosols in the lower atmosphere (the troposphere). A number of volcanic eruptions released large amounts of aerosols in the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere). [https://skepticalscience.com/global-cooling-mid-20th-century.htm](https://skepticalscience.com/global-cooling-mid-20th-century.htm) [https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ar4-wg1-chapter2-1.pdf](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ar4-wg1-chapter2-1.pdf) 
5. Because there was a lot of academic reporting on aerosols causing cooling that already happened, many skeptics and journalists at the time seemed to confuse the conversation of the aerosols cooling effect with the prediction of global cooling. And various news media covered the possible links. 
6. In 2008, Peterson, Connolley, and Fleck wrote a paper that analyzed the confusion of the 1970s cooling consensus myth and separated the very few papers that genuinely predicted global cooling, to papers that still predicted warming and papers that were not taking a position but did mention the dimming effect of aerosols. [https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/2008bams2370.1?mobileUi=0&amp;%C2%A0=&amp;](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/2008bams2370.1?mobileUi=0&amp;%C2%A0=&amp;) 
7. 10 years later, Watts Up With That posted a response to this paper, claiming that papers were miscategorized to revise the narrative that climate scientists were mostly predicting cooling and had to change it back to warming. This doesn’t make sense considering WUWT has published other posts talking about how warming predictions were “wrong” since the conversation in early parts of the 20th century, 
   1. So in short, MacFarlane reclassified many of the papers into incorrect categories and added papers not used in the original report.I posted a response here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/f3fxrw/response\_to\_watts\_up\_with\_thats\_rebuttal\_to\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/f3fxrw/response_to_watts_up_with_thats_rebuttal_to_the/)

In many exchanges between science and pseudoscience, you can find a proponent of the pseudoscience advocating for the debate to be live. A personal gripe with the context I see this request in whether it is the person arguing or supporters of the person arguing, is that it seems to be done in bad faith. The purpose of scientific exchange is comparing verifiable research to rather than relying on rhetoric or personal opinions. In a live debate, you could definitely prepare your sources and arguments, but how would you know if your opponent's argument is true or not? How do you know they accurately represented their source and the source’s conclusion? How will you know it is a credible source? In short, how will you know there isn’t a case of selection bias? Just out of viewing, many promoters of bad science seek live exchanges not to necessarily win the argument, but to win the audience. When the topic in question has such a large following such as climate denialism and race realism are such politically driven topics, supporters will already know who they’ll root for before any information is presented. In short, the advocates for pseudoscience and even science can be influenced by confirmation bias long before the debate even starts. 

*How well will a moderator work in a live exchange?* The purpose of a moderator is to be a neutral participant in the debate. Their role is to make sure the participants don’t go over their time limits and to make sure the participants stay on topic and keep the exchange civil. The moderator is not required to be more knowledgeable on the topic as either participants, so it is not likely that either participants will receive pointers for which argument is factually correct.

according to it, if you create a couple of ""entangled"" particles, separate it via long distance, and then measure it at the same time, then there's around 75% chance they'd be identical (not 100%), rather than the default 50/50 chances.

but what if the process of travel to create the separation is what leads to the 25% deviation? wouldn't that point that they're not entangled at all?

ie :

a couple of spinning tops with the same size, shape, and mass. are spun at the same time with the same amount of kinetic energy.

one was carried by a car several km away. so the external forces from the process of transportation could explain any deviations between the two tops on when they topple.

however, if the two identical tops spins in the same identical conditions (zero deviations), then wouldn't they topple at the exact same time?

i guess my point is that perhaps it's not ""entanglement"" at all.. each identical particle with the same exact conditions would simply have the same exact results when measured. the percentage of discrepancy from the results would be based on the percentage of deviation between the pair's condition.

it's like trying to boil water at point A and point B, each of them will boil at 100 degrees if they have the same exact properties and condition that leads to such a result, not because they're entangled, but simply because they share the exact same properties and conditions which leads to such a result.

likewise, a top or a particle will spin in exactly the same way as their duplicates, for as long as they retain the same exact conditions without the influence of external forces, not because they are ""entangled"", but simply coz their properties and conditions leads to the exact same result.",True,False,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,23539.0,public,self,is quantum entanglement even real?,0.0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/gfo7ww/is_quantum_entanglement_even_real/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That’s why we write cliff notes. 

And if we jump from the highest point, we reincarnate as true goats. 

This is why mountain goats are not true goats until they take the plunge. 

Everybody dies. Death is the organic path to reincarnation.

Unfortunately, this idea has found many audiences on reddit, and there have been [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/c0y76x/resolute_ignorance_on_race_and_iq_courtesy_of/) on this subreddit supporting that stance. Many of the people who advocate for race realism appear well-read and quote studies that seem to support their viewpoint. However, I believe that this ideology is not only extremely dangerous, but is also factually wrong. So, I will be devoting this post to bringing a wide range of evidence to disproving race realism.

First, I want to clarify a few of my positions before beginning my critique:

1. I believe that the IQ test is a reliable and unbiased measure of a significant part of what most people define as intelligence in industrialized societies. While the test has a sordid history of racism and misuse, the most-used IQ tests (eg: the WISC and WAIS) have gone through great lengths in reducing cultural biases in its questions.
2. There is no doubt that there is a racial gap in IQ: what I will be arguing is that this is primarily due to environmental- not genetic causes.
3. Finally, I believe that- like with most things- intelligence is a product of both inherited traits and the environment. In this post, I will be arguing that genetic differences are not the predominant explaining factor for the racial intelligence gap.

With my starting stances out of the way, let us begin:

# A. Evidence from Racial Admixture studies

We benefit from having an African American population in the United States with a wide range of mixed European ancestry. This means we can have a powerful test of the hereditarian hypothesis. If the hereditarian hypothesis accurately explains the difference in Black-White IQ, then African Americans with greater European ancestry should have higher IQs then African Americans with less European ancestry. So, what does the data show?

I will first present a study which recruited black twins from 181 different families in Philadelphia. Using blood group markers, the researchers were able to estimated the percent Caucasian ancestry of the kids before having them take a variety of intelligence tests. They found that there was absolutely no correlation between white ancestry and intelligence. \[1\]

A separate study used skin color as an estimate of Caucasian ancestry and looked at 437 African American participants’ performance on a 10-point vocabulary test. The study found no correlation between skin tone and test performance when controlled for family and childhood educational background \[2\].

At the risk of beating a dead horse, I will look at one last racial admixture study to cement my point. In this study, researchers looked at black, mixed, and white kids adopted by either black or white middle class families. Mixed was defined as the child having one black and one white parent. The researchers (again) found no difference between black and mixed-race children in IQ as measured by WISC. *However*, even more interesting is that kids adopted to white families had significantly higher IQ scores than kids adopted to black families, suggesting a large environmental factor in producing differences in IQ. \[3\]

In order for the race realist argument to hold water, then there *must* be strong evidence that those who have greater European ancestry have a higher iq than those with less European ancestry. However, the various studies I have shown all disprove that argument.

# B. Evidence from Twin Adoption Studies

This section will be structured more as a rebuttal than a point on its own, since race realists tend to rely heavily on twin adoption studies. The logic behind these studies run like this: monozygotic (identical) twins have the same genetic makeup, and adoption allows these twins to be placed in different environments. Therefore, the similarity in IQ between these twins who have been adopted into different households should be from a solely genetic origin. The logical throughline is strong, and race realists have used this experimental paradigm to arrive at IQ heritability values of around 0.85 or higher by adulthood.

This seems to be airtight, rigorous evidence for a high heritability of IQ. However, there is a large fault in a crucial assumption of twin studies: the assumption that the twins are adopted by families with very different backgrounds and live in very different environments. That assumption turns out to be false: Adoptive families tend to be more homogenous, with smaller variability of SES and HOME scores (used to measure the amount of intellectual stimulation present in a family environment). Indeed, a study that accounted for these variables found that the restricted variability of family environments in adoption studies *could account for as much as 50%* of the variance IQ found in these studies.\[4\]

# C. Sub-Saharan IQ

Just as in part B, this section will be formatted as a rebuttal to a common argument of race realists: that the average Sub-Saharan IQ sits at a paltry 70. This IQ of 70 is the most commonly held number by the most prominent race realists such as Arthur Jensen and Richard Lynn \[5\]. One should be immediately skeptical of that number, seeing as that corresponds to a score a full two standard deviations below average. Put it another way, this would mean that the average person in Sub-Saharan Africa is less intelligent than 97% of people in America. So, what is the problem?

The problem lies with a variety of factors that all contribute to poor designs and biased results in the studies that race realists use to support their claim. The literature reviews tend to disregard relevant studies that show higher IQs, and the studies used tend to rely on convenience samples, which would not be relevant to the overall population. Finally, administering a western IQ test to a very different culture in developing nations pose many problems that make the tests less valid. Now, I have made broad attacks on the studies that race realist used without providing citations, and that is because there are several studies I would need to mention and this post is already extremely long. If anyone wants more specific information, I am more than happy to provide it in the comment section.

So, what is the best value we have for Sub-Saharan IQ? For that, I will rely on a systematic review of data on Sub-Saharan performance on Raven's Progressive Matrices. The inclusion criteria for this study was particularly rigorous, excluding any studies that did not adhere to administrative norms and found a value for IQ of...80, a full 10 points higher but still quite low when compared to that of industrialized nations \[6\]. However, there is still one factor to take into account: the Flynn Effect.

If the average Sub-Saharan African was compared to the average British person from 1948 you would find that their IQs would be identical \[6\]. As it turns out, There has been a steady increase in IQ over the 20th century in the industrialized world, a phenomenon called the Flynn Effect. Though the reasons are still unclear, the most common are improvements in children’s health, nutrition, and parental literacy, all of which agree with the limited correlational data we have \[7\]. Seeing as Sub-Saharan Africa is still the poorest region in the world, with poor food security and health infrastructure, it follows that we would see a corresponding Flynn Effect on African populations that mirrors that of the western world over the 20th century as Africa industrializes.

# D. Modern Phrenology

Another core line of argument from race realists is the idea that brain volume correlates with intelligence. This argument is particularly enticing for two reasons: it presents a biological basis for heritable intelligence, and it has the intuitive reasoning that a larger brain means a smarter person. The issue is, as most people reading this can guess, the  best data we have on the relationship between brain volume and intelligence is very minimal.

A meta-analysis of 88 studies on a combined &gt;8000 individuals found that the relationship between brain volume and IQ has an R2 value of...0.06. Put it another way, brain volume explains 6% of the variation in IQ. That is an incredibly low number, and is completely inadequate as a biological basis for genetic causes of intelligence \[8\].

As a last line of evidence on this topic, I want to talk about sex differences in brain volume and IQ. We know that even when adjusted for height and weight, men tend to have a larger brain volume than women \[9\]. Therefore, if brain volume does correlate with intelligence, men should be more intelligent than women on average. However, the evidence for that is simply not there. Studies have shown argued men had lower IQs than women, women have higher IQs than men, and men having equal IQs to women. The best study that I can find, which looked at a nationally representative sample of UK kids and young adults, found no difference in IQ between men and women \[10\]. Again, the different lines of evidence just do not support the idea that larger brain volume means greater intelligence.

# Concluding remarks:

The most popular lines of evidence race realists use to justify the hereditarian hypothesis (twin adoption studies, brain volume studies and cross-national IQ studies) all have deep methodological flaws or do not support their position. Moreover, racial admixture studies provide an extremely powerful contradiction to race realism: greater European ancestry in African Americans simply do not lead to greater IQs. I wrote this post not simply to critique race realism but to provide a wide variety of tools to argue against it, should you need them. I have seen first-hand how persuasive race realist arguments can be, and I think it is absolutely essential that more people should have the requisite knowledge to argue against an ideology that is sadly gaining ground.

I fully expect there to be race realists who will read this and critique it. I am more than willing to have a conversation with them, and I encourage everyone to avoid knee-jerk assertions of racism or personal insults.

Advocates tend to think it is an exception probably because they agree with the ideology of social justice. It is a good ideology, and therefore it can do nothing wrong. But, such an intrusion really is no exception. It means that such scientific fields have become subordinate to the ideology, and this really is at the cost of the sensible models of objective reality.

I will give you an obvious example. About 86% of American anthropologists disagree that ""The human population may be subdivided into biological races."" (see Wagner et al., 2016, [""Anthropologists' views on race, ancestry, and genetics""](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajpa.23120)). It is arguable whether or not this counts as a consensus: what if only 86% of geodesists disagreed that the Earth is flat? Travel to the other side of the world, to China and Russia, and it is also arguably a consensus, but in the other direction: the anthropologists take the existence of biological human races for granted, as though it is obvious (see Leonard Lieberman et al., 2006, [""The Race Concept in Six Regions: Variation Without Consensus""](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8064317_The_Race_Concept_in_Six_Regions_Variation_without_Consensus)). Biological human races are deeply integrated into their scientific practice. They tend to think that the denial of human races is just a weird American thing.

What do you think is going? It almost certainly has to do with the difference in moral perspectives. The denial of human races really is a weird American thing. It started out as a fringe idea in American anthropology in the 1930s, but in the 40s it was heavily promoted by the American federal government, as a means of defeating the Nazi ideology during and after the war (see for example the 1943 American propaganda video [""Don't be a sucker""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGAqYNFQdZ4)). 

Among anthropologists, mere patriotic war propaganda wasn't quite enough to convince them, so they also used bad arguments. The most popular argument is one that you heard already, and it is the [""continuum fallacy.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_fallacy) If you have a spectral boundary between two groups, then the differences between those two groups does not matter. The American Anthropological Association's [""Statement on Race""](https://www.americananthro.org/ConnectWithAAA/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2583) employs this fallacy. In every other context, the fallacy would be obvious. There is no important difference between red and green because of the existence of orange? Don't try that excuse on a traffic cop who accuses you of running a red light. He will think you are either a complete damned idiot or an anthropologist.

Perhaps you have seen this quote before, too: [""The purpose of anthropology is to make the world safe for human differences.""](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22The+purpose+of+anthropology+is+to+make+the+world+safe+for+human+differences%22&amp;ia=web) I have found that quote repeated positively on hundreds of anthropology publications in their website headings, chapter headings, course descriptions, and so on. It is credited to Ruth Benedict, though she neither wrote nor intended precisely that, but that isn't the main problem. The main problem is that the purpose of their science is stated as a political mission. What happens when the actual objective truth comes into conflict with what they presume to be the way to make the world safe for human differences? The science, not the ideology, is compromised. 

The existence of biological human races is not just something that Chinese and Russian anthropologists believe: it follows from a key component of evolutionary biology. When a species geographically diverges into diverse environments, their frequencies of genetic variants likewise diverge, following from either genetic drift, natural selection or both. The diverged subsets of the species are called ""races."" The human species is plainly no exception to this pattern (I recommend this article by the accomplished evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr: [""The Biology of Race and the Concept of Equality""](https://lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/mayr-2002-biology-and-race.pdf)). American anthropologists have divorced their science from the theory of evolution, for the sake of an explicit political mission. 

Importantly, American anthropologists can not actually make the world safer this way. They are already in [sharp conflict](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?type=printable&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040271) with practicing medical doctors, who integrate genetic racial differences into their research, diagnoses and treatments, because of the broadly diverse ways that races genetically differ in every system of the human body (it isn't just sickle-cell anemia; see this article [Burchard et al., 2003, ""The Importance of Race and Ethnic Background in Biomedical Research and Clinical Practice""](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10847069_The_Importance_of_Race_and_Ethnic_Background_in_Biomedical_Research_and_Clinical_Practice)).

&gt; ""[while a number of philosophical ideas] may be logically consistent with present quantum mechanics, ... materialism is not.""

Sadly I couldn't find the original source, but there are signs of quote-mining already, with large chunks of the quote cut out, but even if the quote is accurate, the reason quantum mechanics is science is that we aren't tied to the understanding of the geniuses in the past. I would even dare argue that the average physicist today has a better understanding of quantum mechanics than the best physicists of the early 20th century.

&gt; When they observed, the electron went back to behaving like a little marble! It produced a pattern of two bands, not an interference pattern of many. The very act of measuring, or *observing*, which slit it went through meant it only went through one, not both. The electron decided to act differently as though it was aware it was being watched.

It isn't, of course. This has nothing to do with observation specifically and everything to do with interaction in general. The measurement apparatus entangles with the electron, causing it to turn into a superposition of the electron going through the left slit and the detector detecting it go through the left slit, and the electron going through the right slit and the detector detecting it go through the right slit. Within each eigenstate of the quantum state, it will look as though the electron has suddenly only gone through one slit. This will happen even if one records the data with a computer during your lunch break and you look at the data after you come back. It has nothing to do with people looking at it.

02:11

&gt; The conclusion that was drawn was that the very act of observing caused the wave function to collapse and create the existence of matter. Either in the state of a particle or as a wave.

This is obviously nonsense. If the matter didn't exist as waves prior to your interaction with it, the matter wouldn't interfere with itself and give an interference pattern.

02:20

&gt; According to the Schrödinger equation: Independent of observation particles exist in a state of a wave function, which is a series of potentialities rather than actual objects.

This isn't derived from the Schrödinger equation H|Ψ&gt; = i ∂/∂t |Ψ&gt;. This is simply posited. Particles exist as a quantum state *described by* the wavefunction (aka the state vector). It says nothing about whether the quantum state is an actual object or ""a series of potentialities"", despite the Copenhagenists' insistence on the potentiality interpretation.

&gt; The very act of observing causes wave of potentialities to collapse to a state of matter.

It doesn't. It was matter before you looked. It's still matter after you look. Further, this doesn't explain why measuring in the momentum basis gives you a spread out wave instead.

02:45

I will omit the transcript here, but I will try to describe the setup here. An electron is placed in a superposition of two locations, one in Box 1 and one in Box 2. If you open one, the electron position will collapse to one or the other. If you open both simultaneously, the electron will come out of both as a wave.

This is wrong, even ignoring the invocation of collapse. It depends on how you open the box. If the electron-box system is isolated, then it will not collapse no matter what you do. It will still exist in a superposition of both locations. It might spread out, depending on what the boxes are like, but it could also just stay in the box. Similarly, if you open both boxes simultaneously, it could spread out and it could stay in the box. It is only when you interact with the electron that you will see it in one box or the other (good luck finding it if it's spread out though). It doesn't matter whether you open the boxes one at a time or simultaneously.

03:11

&gt; Matter doesn't exist as a wave of energy prior to observation, but as a wave of potentialities prior to observation.

This is wrong. The energy of a matter wave can be calculated with E = ħ^(2)k^(2)/2m, where k depends on the wavelength. The wave has energy.

03:25

Very well said. The object did not exist in a particular position eigenstate, i.e. it did not have a definite position, prior to your interaction with it. After your interaction, you simply entangle with the quantum system, thus finding it in some particular position eigenstate.

03:44

&gt; Some like Einstein and Schrödinger were deeply troubled by the results of quantum mechanics.

Einstein wasn't troubled by the results of quantum mechanics. He was troubled by the Copenhagen interpretation's violation of causality (acausality). He raised this question: Fire an electron at a slit and let it diffract. On the other side of the slit is a semicircular screen, all points of which are at the same distance from the slit. When the electron hits the screen, it collapses. How does it know to collapse only at one point, as signals cannot travel faster than light? The Copenhagen proponents had no answer. I am not familiar enough with Schrödinger's views to tell whether he was troubled by quantum mechanics rather than the Copenhagen interpretation specifically.

04:46

&gt; If this inequality [Bell's inequality] was shown to be false, then the local hidden variable theories would be debunked and matter would be dependent on observation.

This is a false dichotomy. Local hidden variable theories being untenable still leaves nonlocal (i.e. acausal) hidden variable theories, and local non-hidden-variable theories.

04:56

&gt; This confirmed what quantum mechanics was telling us: Prior to measurement, objects have no defined properties or location!

This is, again, false. Sure, they have no defined location, but this does not mean they have no defined properties. The quantum state is a defined property of any quantum system.

05:01

&gt; The act of a conscious observer creates the existence of the physical objects and the properties they entail. Instantly!

Notice how he snuck the word ""conscious"" in there?

05:30

IP cites [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2529) paper by Groeblacher *et al.* and claims that it falsifies nonlocal hidden variables. It doesn't. Groeblacher *et al.* simply claim:

&gt;Our result suggests that giving up the concept of locality is not sufficient to be consistent with quantum experiments, unless certain intuitive features of realism are abandoned.

One can argue that this makes nonlocal hidden variable theories give up their greatest strength: their intuitive force (as I have done in the past), but this does not falsify nonlocal hidden variables. It is simply an argument against them.

05:35

physicsworld.com is a popular science website, which means everything it says should be taken with a huge mound of salt.

05:41

Haisch is simply wrong here. (Read the abstract of Groeblacher *et al.*) It is possible to construct an objective reality around these constraints, as is done by those who think quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory of nature, and take it to its logical conclusion, also known as the ""many-worlds interpretation"". One may be skeptical of the MWI approach, but the fact that the approach exists is evidence against the nonexistence of objective reality.

06:13

The delayed choice quantum eraser. The favorite tool of quantum woomeisters. I will refer you to two very good explanations of the thought experiment, [the first by PBS Spacetime](https://youtu.be/8ORLN_KwAgs), who consistently produces high-quality physics videos free of unevidenced speculation, and [the second by Sean Carroll](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2019/09/21/the-notorious-delayed-choice-quantum-eraser/), who knows what he's talking about.

Again, remember what IP is trying to do here: His argument is that quantum mechanics says that there is no objective reality. Even if one does not believe the many-worlds approach as stated in Sean Carroll's blog post, it still means that objective reality is compatible with quantum mechanics.

07:02

&gt; Well, to the dismay of materialists, the results would display particles! Observation creates the existence of particles *and* loads up a back history so they went through the double slit as particles.

Again, this is not what happens. You have to keep track of which things are entangled with which. If you perform a pseudo-measurement on which slit the particles went through, i.e. you record them on some qubits which point left or right, and if you measure the recording qubits along the left-right axis, the ones that point left will correspond to the particles that went left, and the ones that point right will correspond to those that went right. If you filter by which way they point, they will give you a blob on the screen for each direction.

But if you decide to destroy the information, such as by measuring along the up-down axis instead, what you will get when you filter by direction is, all the up qubits will correspond to particles that give you an interference pattern, and all the down qubits will correspond to particles that give you another interference pattern, and those two interference patterns cancel out to give you a generic smudge on the screen.

07:31

The Kochen-Specker theorem. The bane of hidden variable theories. It imposes *contextuality* on hidden variable theories, which means the values that the hidden variables had depend on the measurement device you will use to measure them. IP argues that this does away with objective reality. Again, it does not. It is, again, an *argument* against hidden variable theories, and hidden variable proponents are biting quite a few bullets at this point, but it does not *debunk* hidden variable theories, nor does it prove that there is no objective reality (as everyone would see the same measurement result).

Also, Kochen is pronounced /ˈkɔχən/, not /ˈkəʊʧən/. (Yes, I am nitpicking.)

08:23

The nonlocal delayed choice quantum eraser. The arguments against IP's interpretation of this goes the same as the one for the delayed choice quantum eraser, so I won't belabor the point here. The only point I would reiterate is that the many-worlds interpretation is once again ignored, this time by the authors as well. Perhaps they do not consider it ""naïve realism"", but I do. Either way, it does not debunk materialism.

08:46

&gt; Thus the conclusion is inescapable.

Many-worlds interpretation: Am I a joke to you?

09:20

&gt; Until then, to just dismiss all this science pointing in the opposite direction is nothing more than a faith-based opinion!

There is no ""science pointing in the opposite direction"". Only the ramblings of a woo peddler who (I can safely presume) doesn't even know what the canonical commutation relations are.

09:26

&gt; Now many have tried to get around this by trying to separate the quantum world from the macro world, but that was also falsified in 2010 by violations of the Leggett-Garg inequality.

Of course he doesn't explain what the Leggett-Garg inequality is. It basically states that measurements can be made without affecting the system and, along with the definition of a macroscopic object as something that is only in one definite macroscopically distinct state at any time. The violation of this inequality simply says that quantum mechanics is true, which, given the subject, is rather trivial.

IP then cites [this](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007APS..MARB33005B/abstract) talk (only the abstract is available), which proves his point about there not being a clean quantum-classical split much better. Ironically this is directly at odds with Eugene Wigner, whose quote he cited in the beginning of the video. Many Copenhagenists believed that there is a quantum-classical divide which they call the Heisenberg cut.

10:17

Finally, the many-worlds interpretation!

10:33

&gt; But it is riddled with problems unlike the idealist understanding, and it is an apparent violation of Occam's razor.

Emphasis on ""apparent"". The central idea of the many-worlds interpretation is that there is only the quantum state which evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. What it gives you is macroscopic entangled states and superpositions. Because the many-worlds interpretation does not add anything extra onto the Schrödinger equation and the quantum state such as hidden variables or a collapse, it is actually favored by Occam's razor, just like how special relativity is favored by Occam's razor over the Lorentz ether theory.

And of course, claiming that MWI is riddled with problems and the idealist understanding isn't doesn't make it true.

10:42

&gt; Introducing a large number of worlds that we also cannot detect is an extreme violation of this, especially when this can be explained by accepting all these possibilities just exist in a mathematical probability as a wavefunction, instead of as actual worlds that can never be verified or falsified.

Anyone who is capable of saying this has not done the first bit of research into the many-worlds interpretation. The worlds are not introduced. They are simply what appear if you take quantum mechanics seriously as a fundamental theory of the universe. Everything has to follow quantum mechanics, and quantum mechanics says that things entangle and evolve into superpositions. Hence many-worlds. If one disputes this, one must show where and how quantum mechanics fails, which has not been shown.

10:58

&gt; An idealist understanding can explain this just fine, with much less and other aspects of reality that we dealt with in our last video.

Again, asserting that his ""idealist understanding"" can explain this without ever getting into the math of *why* his idealist understanding can actually explain this.

11:05

&gt; The many-worlds interpretation doesn't have enough explanatory power and has to postulate so much more in order to explain the little it can.

Again, it doesn't postulate anything apart from a quantum state and the Schrödinger equation, which every other understanding of quantum mechanics *must have as well*. It doesn't add anything onto those two things, unlike every other understanding of quantum mechanics.

11:12

Haisch is right there, although it is better thought of (and more accurate to the theory) to say that the universe splits however many times a second, rather than duplicates.

11:39

&gt; So this is absurd to postulate and unnecessary to do so.

IP is right here. This would be absurd to postulate. However, the ""many worlds"" of MWI is a consequence, not a postulate.

12:06

Henry and Palmquist, as quoted by IP, share his misunderstandings of quantum mechanics. And they also suddenly invoke gods.

Michio Kaku also flirts with sensationalism rather than accuracy. I hope the previous parts of this post have explained sufficiently why cosnciousness has nothing to do with quantum mechanics that you can see why his little spiel is wrong.

15:37

IP repeats the incorrect thought experiment of the 02:45 mark.

15:53

&gt; So the evidence suggests we are just lesser mind dependent on a larger mind that is actually in control of the structure of the experience.

Even granting IP's thought experiment is correct, it in no way suggests that there is a larger mind in control of where the electron collapses to (again assuming that collapse is even right).

16:28

&gt; Space and matter are illusions of our conscious observation,^([citation needed]) as the falsification of realism shows.

Also, realism wasn't falsified.

17:09

Again Tesla was a fraud who never invented anything original. 

And math is the cornerstone of physics: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/82493/how-important-is-mathematical-proof-in-physics

A good example of the subtle interplay between mathematical reasoning and experimental testing is the history of the idea of local realism and quantum mechanics, as tested by von Neumann's argument against the idea of hidden variables and the EPR paradox leading onto the work of John Bell and the experimentally tested violations of his inequality, therefore making the idea of local realism harder and harder to uphold. All of these ideas involved logical and mathematical reasoning to foretell experimental results that people had formerly thought to be absurd, and therefore greatly advanced our understanding of quantum physics. See the following Wikipedia pages for a summary: Bell's Theorem, John Stewart Bell, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox as well as the paper David Mermin, ""Is the moon there when nobody looks? Reality and the quantum theory"", Physics Today, April 1985.

Mathematics was developed by the Ancient Greeks for intellectual challenge and pleasure. Surprisingly, many of their discoveries later played prominent roles in physical theories, as in the case of the conic sections in celestial mechanics.

This is held, along with a handful of “add-ons” aka “rescue helicopters,” to be a sufficient explanation for the generation of all life’s wonders. One problem has to do with small- versus large-scale mutations. The first is a source of only trivial change; the second is a killer:

&gt;All mutations which have been observed which are non-harmful only allow for small-scale change while all mutations which could potentially change the architecture [of an organism] have been shown to be harmful.

&gt;And the trivial changes do not add up to wonderful, large-scale novelties. But for life to get to a place where mutations are possible in the first place — where there is anything to mutate — it has to overcome another impossible dilemma, at the very beginning when life is waiting to bootstrap itself into existence:

&gt;Nothing in nature will ever simultaneously go to both low entropy and high energy at the same time. It’s a physical impossibility. Yet life had to do that. Life had to take simple chemicals and go to a state of high energy and of low entropy. That’s a physical impossibility.

Your kidding. First off on what grounds can minor mutations not be able to build up?

The iron-sulfur sensor activates the correct option to optimize production of sugars. The team calls this an “elegant regulatory mechanism in the photosynthetic processes of plants.”

&gt;Why, then, do they attribute it to evolution? What purpose do these statements serve?

&gt;“[T]he chloroplast sensor kinase (CSK) protein is equipped with an evolutionarily conserved iron-sulfur cluster.” If it is conserved, it wasn’t evolving. The adjective “evolutionarily” adds nothing.
&gt;“CSK is an ancient protein found in both cyanobacteria and chloroplasts.” How old it is according to believers in evolutionary common descent doesn’t matter. What matters is how it works.
&gt;“More than a billion years ago a cyanobacterium took up residence inside a eukaryotic host cell and became the chloroplast of plants and algae,” Puthiyaveetil says. Nobody saw that happen, and it’s a controversial just-so story that acts as a sideshow. (“The origin of eukaryotes remains unclear,” Nature says in a new paper, undermining confidence in the dogmatic story told here.)
&gt;The fact that cyanobacteria, diatoms, and plants have similar CSK proteins proves nothing about evolution or common descent. A new and light-hearted educational video from Discovery Institute explains the circular reasoning behind claims of homology. This news release about photosynthesis, and the paper in Communications Biology behind it (“An evolutionarily conserved iron-sulfur cluster…”), would be cleaner after a Darwin-ectomy. Without the distracting evolutionary sideshow, readers can enjoy the main show — an example of an “elegant regulatory mechanism” behind photosynthesis which, by producing both food and oxygen, plays a key role in the habitability of planet Earth.

First off the video they mention doesn't understand homologies: https://np.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/es5qk3/the_discovery_institute_needs_to_shut_up/

Second his logic could be said ""we dont need to assume intelligent design"" but then where did it come from? Why assume design then? 

Third: https://www.pnas.org/content/103/32/12021
It at the very least tells us where it came from.
Yes evolution doesn't need to explain function, but where it came from.

But wait should the fact that these occur prove that this is how biology works?

Hmmm, when people say ""how biology works"" what are they saying? That biology can't be altered by outside forces? 

Here are two quick takes from the guy: 

http://politicalhat.com/2020/01/23/quick-takes-california-madness-genderless-graduates-preteen-polyamory-liquidating-kulaks-as-a-class/

&gt;When you gotta go super-genderless…

&gt;“College departments across the country are avoiding the term ‘alumni,’ opting instead to use ‘alumnx,’ even though the original term is gender neutral.

So? https://www.reddit.com/r/GGdiscussion/comments/ete11k/billy_d_aka_oneangrygamer_has_returned_and_is_as/

So using gender-neutral language is the same as saying there is no such thing as gender i.e. genderless...I think you got your terms mixed up?

&gt;Monogomy is so doubleplusungood, that the schools have to teach kids that polyamory is spiffy!

&gt;“It was a California teacher who discovered the ‘LGBT Consensual Non-Monogamy Task Force.’ She was reviewing the state Department of Education’s ‘health; lesson mandates for the fall and stumbled across a term she didn’t know. She went to look it up, and was led to the American Psychological Association.

&gt;“California instructs teachers to talk to youngsters about sex ‘partners.’ They are to avoid terms like ‘boyfriend’ and ‘girlfriend’ because ‘some students may be non-monogamous.’ This is in the lesson plan for 12-year-olds.

&gt;“There it is. The American Psychological Association reaching its crusty paw all the way down to pre-pubertal kids.”

First off she misunderstands what the letter says: https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/he/cf/documents/hefwch5gr7-8.docx

&gt;As a follow-up activity, Ms. G distributes cards listing examples of relationship behaviors (e.g., talking on the phone, texting each other every day, hanging out during lunch, holding hands, hugging, kissing, flirting, cuddling, hanging out outside of school, touching your hair, oral sex, sexual intercourse, having an exclusive relationship, marriage, having children, and getting tested for STI/HIV together). 

&gt;A couple is dating and one partner wants to have sexual intercourse. The other partner does not.
&gt;Two people are kissing and one partner pulls out a condom. The other partner says ""Let's not bother.""

Look closely when the letter says partners. The exact wording isn't 'sex partners' isn't it? That is because weasley words are being used to make a connection between having a romantic partner, and having sex, thus talking about partners means focusing on sex. 

[https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/Sexuality-explained](This is bs): 

&gt;Sexuality is not about who you have sex with, or how often you have it. Sexuality is about your sexual feelings, thoughts, attractions and behaviours towards other people. You can find other people physically, sexually or emotionally attractive, and all those things are a part of your sexuality. 
 
Finally turns out understanding how healthy relationships work shows that polyamory isn't dangerous:

You can prove Nihilism is objectively true

Magister colin leslie dean the only modern Renaissance man

HAS SHOWN

First you can prove by logic all products of human thinking end in meaningless

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/All-things-are-possible.pdf

Now natural language is inconsistent “now it is clear from the work of Tarski that the language of everyday speech is” semantically closed” and hence inconsistent”""

thus

""Now with the inconsistency of language all possible views and their negation are now possible""

""Each view contains within it its negation as all views end in meaninglessness""

Second you can then prove using that logic that the logic you use ends in paradox

Quick intro to this site from wikipedia:

&gt;Although dominated by physics and mathematics submissions, viXra aims to cover topics across the whole scientific community. It accepts submissions without requiring authors to have an academic affiliation and without any threshold for quality. The e-prints on viXra are grouped into seven broad categories: physics, mathematics, computational science, biology, chemistry, humanities, and other areas. Anyone may post anything on viXra, though house rules do prohibit “vulgar, libellous, plagiaristic or dangerously misleading” content. As a result, the site has a reputation among physicists for hosting ""material of no interest"".

I don't even know where to start with this paper. I guess the materials and methods section.

&gt;2.1 Oxidative Phosphorylation

&gt;&gt;In eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the mitochondrial cristae. It comprises the electron transport chain that establishes a proton gradient (chemiosmotic potential) across the boundary of inner membrane by oxidizing the NADH produced from the Krebs cycle. ATP is synthesized by the ATP synthase enzyme when the chemiosmotic gradient is used to drive the phosphorylation of ADP. The electrons are finally transferred to exogenous oxygen and, with the addition of two protons, water is formed (Reece. Urry et al., 2010).

This isn't a material or a method. It's a one-paragraph summary of the process taken from Campbell. The next part of the M&amp;M is the same thing, but for fermentation. In fact, this entire paper is just a theoretical proposal, so why is there an M&amp;M to begin with?

&gt;Human body consists of billions of eukaryote cells. Each cell consists of many microorganisms. 

I guess they're trying to incorporate the human microbiome, or saying that organelles are organisms? 

&gt;If we assume the spin of a normal human eukaryotic cell as +1/2, the spin of a cancer cell is –1/2 in the whole body. The physical reason behind the high division of the cancer cells is to make the whole body remain a QES.

When cells can be described as quantum particles that exist in one of two states.

I'd personally like a more coherent explanation before just accepting this as fact. Maybe they'll show how adopting this framework can more accurately describe and predict cancer progression?

&gt;The cancer cells cannot live apart from the body; therefore, the sum of the normal eukaryotic cells and cancerous eukaryotic cells is a QES. Therefore, based on the EMHC hypothesis, cancer cells are normal cells that have traveled back 1.5 billion years in time, which explains the reason why their spin is –1/2 as a quantum particle.

[me irl](https://i.imgur.com/Qgyddsq.png)

&gt;Entanglement is broken when the entangled particles decohere through interaction with the environment. As discussed above, cancer cells are eukaryotic cells living more than 1.5 billion years apart from the present time in coordination with the present healthy cells inside the human body as a QES. Therefore, cancer is a side effect of the whole body as a QES just like time as measured and theorized by Don Page and William Wootters in 1983. Cancer is an emergent phenomenon for external observers but absent for internal observers of the human body, just as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation predicts.

&gt; Therefore, putting the whole entangled system in a new state of time apart from the cancer and healthy cells timeline would be a rational and effective treatment of this side- effect. For example, introducing a high fat-low carb diet will put the whole body in a new state of time. Human cells use high glucose, moderate glutamine and low fats to produce ATP in the present evolutionary time. But introducing a high fat-low glutamine-lowest carb diet will turn the whole body into an entangled system and force itself to keep this entanglement and eliminate cancer cells as primitive different particles living in the present time.

So how does this wildly unnecessary framework help illuminate cancer bio?

I found it by googling PH for uric acid and was confused by the claim by google answers as logic says all OH ions will be consumed by the stomach acid and It is a common alternative medicine thing quacks promote.  So I copy pasted the conclusion to find the study as it was not cited.  The first issue I had is that it only surveyed women which rubbed me the wrong way as usually medical studies include both or only men so I thought there was something fishy as women produce less uric acid anyway ( [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3545402/figure/F1/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3545402/figure/F1/) ). Then I saw in shock that it was only 26 people and changed the diet for 5 days and tested the pee in 3. But the worst thing is not necessarily the study but the google answer as it clearly says  ""Drinking acid-free ionized alkaline water will gradually elevate one's blood pH and the gout will disappear naturally"" However the study doesn't just change the water but the food eaten by the 26 women.

The video is broken up into 6 different segments, each of which is devoted to refuting a ""myth"" that people who deny the existence of a pay gap purportedly believe. I am going to divide my analysis in the same way, going through each segment one by one with time stamps for each one. So, let's begin:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Only 61% of men believe men make more than women for doing the same job. But the reality is, U.S. women working full-time earned just 80 cents for every dollar men earned in 2016. [0:09](https://youtu.be/psBpokjjqpA?t=9)

Before even starting the myth-busting, the video starts making mistakes. Here, they try to disprove the statement that men and women make the same money for the same job by saying that there is a large wage gap between men and women working full-time. The very obvious flaw in this argument is that men and women tend to work different jobs. When controlled for occupation and qualifications, a 2019 Payscale study showed that women earned 98 cents for every dollar earned by men^(1). So, there is a gap between men and women working the same job, but it is much smaller than what the video purports.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Myth 1: women leave the workforce to have children. [0:31](https://youtu.be/psBpokjjqpA?t=31)

The evidence that many women leave the workforce after having children is fairly solid, a 2014 KFF/NYT poll showed that 61% of unemployed women said that family responsibilities was the major cause for unemployment^(2). The video doesn’t actually dispute this, however it does argue that women are *forced* to leave the workforce and that they do not do so voluntarily. They cite literature that shows that mothers are discriminated against, getting lower wages even though they have the same qualifications^(3). As far as I can tell, their study is legitimate and robust. I tend to agree with the video that there is discrimination in this respect. However, they fail to justify the assumption that discrimination is the main driver for women leaving the workplace after having kids. In fact, most studies tend to support the most obvious answer why mothers leave the workforce: childcare becomes a large responsibility that women have to juggle, and so many leave the workforce to focus on childcare^(4). In the same KFF/NYT poll mentioned earlier, only 15% of non-employed homemakers say that discrimination is a reason for not working.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Myth 2: Men simply work harder and work longer hours. [1:06](https://youtu.be/psBpokjjqpA?t=66)

This is, in my opinion, the second to worst argument of the entire video and the one that basically caused the youtube comment section to explode. Men tend to work more paid hours than women^(5), and the video does not deny that. However, the video says that women work more unpaid hours (household chores, childcare, etc) than men, and that this somehow destroys the myth. The disconnect here is that women working more unpaid hours does not “bust the myth” that men work more paid hours, which partially contributes to the income gap.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Myth 3: Men are educated than women [1:31](https://youtu.be/psBpokjjqpA?t=91)

This is a strawman. I have never heard of a person argue that the pay gap does not exist because men are more educated than women, and I don’t believe any prominent right-wing figure believes that. However, this point still has glaring flaws.The video argues that when you compare men and women with the same level of education, the pay gap is even larger, and that this proves “men are awarded disproportionately for earning the same credentials as women”. However, this neglects to mention the different choices in majors between men and women, with men tending to study in more lucrative fields. An American Association of University Women report states this: “One year after graduation, the average full-time-employed female social science major earned just 66 percent of what the average full-time-employed female engineering or engineering technology major earned. Men who majored in a social science field, likewise, earned just 70 percent of what men who majored in engineering or engineering technology earned”^(6). To say that men make more than women with the same level of education is technically true, but ignores significant reasons for the difference that are not due to discrimination.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Myth 4: Women do not know how to negotiate [1:59](https://youtu.be/psBpokjjqpA?t=119)

This is their strongest argument of the video. They admit that women tend to negotiate less than men and that this could be a reason women’s wages are lower than men’s. However, they point to research that shows that women who initiated negotiation received systematically worse evaluations from male evaluators^(7). The video then says that this stigma against women could be a key driver for the propensity of women to negotiate less. The study that they point to seems by all accounts to be well done, and others who study the wage gap (such as Marianne Bertrande and Francine D. Blau) agree with the study’s findings^(8,9). The only possible nitpick that I might have is that the video portrays the research as a done deal, when more work needs to be done to fully determine the causes for differences in negotiation behavior between men and women.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Myth 5: Men pursue higher paying careers [2:20](https://youtu.be/psBpokjjqpA?t=140)

This is another point that they don’t dispute even though it’s supposed to be a “myth”, but they argue that higher-paying careers going to men is another form of discrimination. They say that when women enter a field, the employers see the jobs as less valuable or prestigious and so the wages in that field decrease^(10). This idea is called the Devaluation Hypothesis, and the video makes a very contentious theory sound like scientific truth. Multiple studies have poked holes in the theory, with one finding that there was no causal effect between sex composition and wages^(11). Another 2013 study showed that “Percent F (percent female) explains a very small portion of the occupational-level variance in wages”^(12). Indeed, there are multiple competing theories, such as crowding theory, where women entering an occupation can increase labor supply and therefore depress wages^(13). This becomes relevant later, as the video points to various statistics that show wages dropping after women enter a field. However, the study the video uses does not take into account labor supply, which could explain the decrease in wages observed.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Myth 6: It’s just 20 cents, and that barely makes a difference [2:45](https://youtu.be/psBpokjjqpA?t=165)

This is the worst argument of the video, for the simple reason that it is a blatant strawman. There are plenty of wage-gap deniers on youtube, reddit, and other social media. I have never known a single one that says that a 20% difference in wages is insignificant. For a video that purports to bust widespread myths, it seems to present many that no one believes.

&amp;#x200B;

This video is the exact kind of ammunition that the alt-right wants. The video misrepresents science, has serious logical flaws, and completely fails to disprove many of the myths it brings up. It’s the exact thing that people can use to point to feminists as delusional or devoid of facts. What is more, there is something that cannot be shown in this post but can be seen in the video: the presenters have a maddeningly condescending attitude, acting like anyone who disagrees with them are complete idiots. As I have shown, *there are smatterings of good points in their video* in particular their points in Myth 4. However, their demeanor makes it so hard for me to agree with them on anything, and I can only guess that this is one reason why the like-to-dislike ratio of the video is so lopsided.

I believe that the gender pay gap is real, and that discrimination is a large cause of it. However, it is also immensely complex and does not lend itself to hot-takes or simple yes or no answers. Videos like this only serve to hinder real progress. If anyone wants to know the current state of the scientific study of the wage gap, I highly recommend [this 2016 working paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w21913.pdf). My views also happen to adhere very closely with this paper’s.

Describing some people as looking distinctly European, while others as looking more East Asian.

Even siblings with the same birth parents in these regions may be described as having a stark contrast from one another in appearance. Upon bringing this up, visitors discover that the locals are, for the most part, completely unaware of this. Some who visitors would describe as very different, are locally perceived to be similar looking.

This same type of situation is often seen in other, typically obscure parts of the world. Such as parts of North Africa, where foreigners may describe a group as consisting of people who appear to look European, further south African, or even South Asian.

What people are describing is very clear and distinct patterns reemerging within these populations.

What is occurring here is pareidolia; the perception of a recognizable image or meaningful pattern where none exists or is intended.

Anthropologists conflated this with genetic diversity, which remains completely unaffected.

[https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2006/04/mtdna-of-ancient-cumanians.html](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2006/04/mtdna-of-ancient-cumanians.html)

&gt;Our results suggest that the Cumanians, as seen in the excavation at  Csengele, were far from genetic homogeneity. Nevertheless, the grave  artifacts are typical of the Cumanian steppe culture; and five of the  six skeletons that were complete enough for anthropometric analysis appeared Asian rather than European (Horváth 1978, 2001), including two  from the mitochondrial haplogroup H, which is typically European. It is interesting that the only skeleton for which anthropological examination indicated a partly European ancestry was that of the chieftain, whose haplotype is most frequently found in the Balkans.

Proponents of taxonomical distinctions in humans often site the very clear sense of an identifiable difference which can occur when viewing two people from opposing sides of the world side by side, but does not typically occur when viewing two people from the same culture side by side.

This clear physical difference is cited as proof that various populations must have at least some degree of difference in biological function, however inconsequential it may be.

Although, this observation could not occur without the use of a visual reference, which is perception which depends entirely on a persons background.

Physical diversity can be perceived in any group depending on the references used. For example, in the last several centuries, Europe, South Asia, East Asia, and the U.S. became particularity internationally recognizable areas of the world. Though, with sustained exposure to only Central Asians and North Africans, Europeans may be described as having ""a strikingly diverse range in phenotype between the physical extremes present in humans.""

The process of passing on genetic alleles is completely randomized, and not intended to fall in specific patterns which people give meaning.

The range of traits found within an individual population is never socially assigned ethnic associations. For example, in North Africa, those whose who inherit light hair at random are not given different ethnic associations than those who inherit dark hair at random, just as those who inherit light skin at random are not given different ethnic associations than those who inherit dark skin at random, although this is not the case in Brazil or South Africa for example, which have different social groups of people who often have either darker or lighter skin.

This observation is always going to be reference dependent, being that the full range of human traits can be expressed within the same, unbroken gene pool, with each trait occurring in significant proportions.

A population like this could not objectively be described as more diverse in appearance, compared to any single population we can currently think of for reference.

Sufficient gene pool diversity and diversity of traits to avoid bottlenecking is found in any part of the world. It is supported by some genetic evidence that today's humans are descended from a very small population of between 1,000 and 10,000 breeding pairs that existed about 70,000 years ago, which has been linked to the Toba eruption in Indonesia.

Human migration consisted of random scrambling in all directions, and can not be summed up with a synchronized candelabra.

Many ancient humans would be considered to look diverse in modern standards. At many times in history, unrelated groups of people on different sides of the world are considered to look similar. An example is indigenous Filipino people such as Ati and Aeta people, and New Guinea (Indonesia and Papua New Guinea), two unrelated groups of people where many are considered to look African American, a third additional unrelated group of people.

Recessive traits, traits that are inherited with multiple genes, and traits inherited through incomplete dominance (such as hair color, skin tone, and hair type) are only expressed with a very high frequency occurring in the gene pool, despite the genes for their expression being found in significant amounts, they are usually hidden. Although, all of these traits can be found, and are found, with a full range of their expression in the same population.

&amp;#x200B;

[Punnet square demonstrating the recessive allele \(y\) and the dominant allele \(Y\). Yy: heterozygous genotype, YY\/yy homozygous genotypes. \(Incorrect color scheme is shown.\) ](https://preview.redd.it/s2o6uzx80o741.png?width=265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb3382fe217722213fe678547d6cb81bee0696eb)

In a group of people were 1/20 carry a recesive allele for blond hair, the chance of two meeting is 1/400, and the chance of passing on two copies of the allele is 1/4. In this case, blond hair would only be expressed in 1/1600 despite occurring in 1/20 people.

Facial features used in recognition are simply very specific combinations of traits. Most individual facial details appear around the world to some degree. When seeing an individual person from another population, without any unique traits, they may be seen as typical in appearance. Although, once seeing a group of multiple people, the specific combination of facial details can be recognized with high confidence, and from then on used as a facial recognition mechanism.

If there has been any minor changes in biological function between any given populations, then when members of the proposed classifications or circular cline intermix the resulting offspring should at least present with a statistically higher chance of illness, if neither infertility or death. On the other hand, if there has been significant bottlenecks, which have been maintained across continents, the resulting offspring should present with a statistically lower chance of illness due to healthier gene pool diversity, which can be seen mongrel dog breeds.

Although, neither of these appear to be the case in humans, therefore the human population as a whole should not present with any physical or genetic differences outside of what can be observed within a single, homogeneous, unbroken population.

If you believe this is not the case, there is a simple method of demonstrating it:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic\_diversity#Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity#Measures)

&gt;Genetic diversity of a population can be assessed by some simple measures.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Gene diversity** is the proportion of [polymorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)#Genetics) loci across the [genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome).  
&gt;  
&gt;[**Heterozygosity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity#Heterozygosity_in_population_genetics) is the fraction of individuals in a population that are heterozygous for a particular locus.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Alleles per locus** is also used to demonstrate variability.  
&gt;  
&gt;[**Nucleotide diversity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide_diversity)  is the extent of nucleotide polymorphisms within a population, and is  commonly measured through molecular markers such as micro- and  minisatellite sequences, mitochondrial DNA, and [single-nucleotide polymorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism) (SNPs).  
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, stochastic simulation software is commonly used to  predict the future of a population given measures such as allele  frequency and population size..

Instead of falling down an unending loop of genetically graphing the degree of  resemblance various populations around the world have to your chosen reference groups on a world map, demonstrating which places you consider to be mixed and which places aren't, then when the basis of these points are questioned, simply refer back to the map, and the circular reasoning continues.

Applying ecology completely cuts the circle short.

If the populations you consider to be mixed have less gene pool diversity than the populations you use as references, your classifications may be awarded taxonomical credibility.

As for haploid groups, this is applying the same type of data used to map language families on genetics collection. They are scientific uses of data for representing historical migration, they do not represent similarity.

The  terms ""Caucasoid"", ""Mongoloid"" and ""Negroid"" date back to the 1700's, long before DNA was known to exist. ""Caucasoid"" is named after the Caucasians, which are people from the Caucasus, a mountain chain including  Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, parts of Russia,  Iran, and Turkey. ""Mongoloid"", comes from the Mongol people of  Mongolia, China, and  Russia. These regions were chosen arbitrarily to the preferences of  German philosopher Christoph Meiners, along with a region including  both India and Australia, and another including North  and South America.

The modern concept of these originates in the 1900's US. Which, clearly by a completely unintended chance, represents American ethnic groups very closely. Black, White, and Native Americans, and more recent immigration particularly from Asian and Latin American countries.

These groups are social or cultural categories, which depend on the setting. In the same way that Papuan tribes are. Neither is it an exception that the majority of people in a western region of China can call themselves a member of one of the groups  ""Tajik"", ""Han"", ""Mongol"", ""Kazakh"",  ""Kyrgyz"", ""Uyghur"", or  ""Hui"".

When groups like these are applied in genetics, in reality someone is taking a reference set of DNA collected from an arbitrarily chosen population that purely represents the idea of a certain group in someone's opinion.

It has this big bold title that *heavily implies*  eating hot peppers will make you live longer. Yet, the study has a ton  of flaws that many epidemiological studies fall into, and the [article](https://www.inverse.com/article/61745-spicy-food-chili-pepper-health) based on the study misinterprets a lot of what is in the study.

So what are the problems with the study? Well hold on because some of it is unbelievable:

**1) All information on diet was taken via a questionnaire administered one time.** The median follow-up time was 8.2 years, meaning that to measure a participant's diet over the course of *more than 8 years*,  the researchers only used a diet questionnaire administered once when  the participants were first enrolled. This means that if participants  changed their diets at all during the 8 year timespan, which many of  them will, the researchers' data would become incorrect.

**2) The questionnaire used to measure diet has some serious flaws.**  The researchers used the EPIC Food Frequency Questionnaire adapted for  the Italian population to measure diet. Yet, other scientists that  validated the questionnaire observed that people using the questionnaire  under-reported total caloric intake, protein intake, cholesterol  intake, and fat intake while over-reporting things such as fiber and  Vitamin C intake. Moreover, they also saw different biases between men  and women. For example, women significantly under-reported alcohol  intake whereas men only slightly over-reported it. All of this is to say  that the questionnaire used probably will not accurately measure diet,  and certainly not for a period of over 8 years.

**3) The study was not designed to prove causation**.  This was an epidemiological study that did not assign any treatment to  any groups of people. It only measured diet and other parameters over  the course of years and looked for any significant correlations. Even  though the researchers did try to control for many potential  confounders, the only way to conclude causation is by assigning  treatment to one of two groups and measuring any differences that arise  between those groups, which the researchers did not do.

**4) Causation is extremely suspect.** The study design did not stop the researchers from heavily implying causation and trying to find a causal mechanism. First, *the researchers did not find a step-wise dose-dependent relationship between mortality and chili pepper intake*.  This means that as chili pepper intake increased, there was no  corresponding decrease in mortality. There was only a difference between  consumers and none/rare consumers. Therefore, the implication that  eating more chili peppers leads to decreased mortality is false. Second,  the researchers measured anti-inflammatory markers to determine if the  anti-inflammatory properties of chili peppers could explain the decline  in mortality. They found no attenuation of risk. They also did not find a  decrease in BMI in participants that ate chili peppers, ruling out  weight-loss as a cause for the decline in mortality risk as well.  Therefore, the researchers tried but could not identify any possible  causal mechanism for pepper intake decreasing mortality.

**5) P-hacking is a strong possibility for this study**. The authors *did not actually perform any recruitment or fieldwork seen in this study*.  The authors took all of their data from another study called the  Moli-Sani Project, which performed all of the measurements on a small  Italian region. The Moli-Sani researchers measured hundreds of different  variables from SES to cardiovascular health to diet. Our authors could  have mixed and matched these hundreds of variables until they found a  significant correlation and used that to publish their paper. Moreover,  as far as I can tell, the authors did not preregister their research to  any outside organization and so were able to mix and match variables as  they pleased.

Nutrition  science is incredibly difficult, and I do not envy the scientists who  perform research in that field. However, I still cannot condone  sensationalist and poorly-designed studies that pervade nutrition  science. This particular study had multiple egregious mistakes such as  measuring diet only once with a questionable questionnaire or implying  causation when there is none. What's worse, the reddit post based on  this research gained a huge amount of traction, meaning many people  would have seen and believed the misleading implication that eating more  hot peppers would lead to a longer life.

Anyway, hi /r/badscience! I’m pretty much certain that nobody remembers me, but I used to have fun making these little high effort R1s back in the day here and people really liked them! I truly had a blast, and I recently watched a show that made me want to return here again. So, not that it will mean anything to anyone, but long time no see. :) Really had fun with this one and look forward to any polite thoughts, amendments, addendums, et cetera!
#Introduction: What is Dr. STONE all about?
So, I just finished *Dr. STONE*, binged it all while studying for my physics final (which I did pretty well on, thanks for asking). It’s not perfect; I could definitely write a pretty detailed review on its aesthetic and moral accuracies and inaccuracies, but I’m willing to bet plenty of people more experienced with that sort of thing already are, and have repeated the points I’d have to make ad nauseam.

No, what really prompted me to write about *Dr. STONE* is not my assessment of how good the show is and whatever evidence I have to convince you that I’m right (though I do think it’s a fairly good show), but rather my claims about the accuracy of *Dr. STONE’s* claims about *science.* The show, for those unfamiliar with it, is about a teenager with superhuman scientific knowledge trying to see if he can (for reasons I won’t reveal) obtain our technology from scratch.

While he does this, the show explores a lot of topics central to **what science is:**

1. Does science produce epistemic achievements about unobservables? That is, does science ever figure out anything? Are our best scientific theories approximating *truth?*
2. What is the essence of science?
3. Does science have a specific method to it? If so, what?
4. Who should we, and scientists, recognize as having epistemic authority?

All of these are really important questions, but I can’t go over them all. Here’s a brief answer to each of them, and an overview of what I’ll be discussing in this post.

1. Experts are about four times as likely to say “yes” than “no,” but there’s still a lot of disagreement on the issue. Furthermore, despite the expert consensus on the matter, scientists at large seem to disagree, with many leading scholars observing that scientists tend to hold or express what are called “anti-realist” attitudes.
2. Not any of the main answers prior to the last few decades.
3. No, “the scientific method” is a myth (though fortunately, people are [listening more and more](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4522609/) to experts on the matter) and there’s likely no such thing, though often useful for teaching those unfamiliar with science about it.
4. There’s disagreement, but there’s been a stronger push away from hard distinctions between observers and subjects in terms of epistemic authority, and naïve notions of objectivity. Much research shows that they have an ironic tendency of moving us away from the objective truth.

I could talk at great length about all of these issues and how the shows explore them. I’m especially passionate about 4. But I’ll be going with 2, and briefly, 3.

I should clarify that I don’t think the show (and presumably manga)  is wildly inaccurate, bordering on pseudoscience or anything. Indeed, it’s *specifically the fact* that the manga is so well-researched, accurate, and pays so much attention to detail *that* it makes for a good subject of analysis. I mean, who would want to see me give a detailed analysis of how *Ant-Man* or *Avengers: Endgame* is at odds with science? I think everyone can tell the films were playing it a bit fast and loose with quantum mechanics (and classical mechanics, and their own mechanics, etc.).

But *Dr. STONE* can be so accurate that where it gets things wildly inaccurate becomes *especially* interesting. It’s actually so good that instead of writing a paper like my professor asked for for my final assignment, I wrote a *Dr. STONE* (and *Back to the Future*) inspired short story that explores the four issues I just listed above. I won’t be sharing that story, of course; it was a rushed, 3-day final project, but this should speak to just how much I fell in love with elements from this show.

So. What is the essence of science?
#How Dr. STONE drops the philosophers’ stone: What Senku says
Senku makes a lot of offhand comments about what science is. While the show proposes several positions with respect to all four topics above, I’ll be focusing on the things relating to topics 2 and 3. Some stuff worth going over are Senku’s claims that:

* Figuring out the [underlying rules](https://i.imgur.com/Pyiz78f.png) or mechanisms of phenomena is the [basis of science](https://i.imgur.com/I7KouZU.png).
* Scientific method essentially involves [hypothesizing and experimenting over and over](https://i.imgur.com/iSscDF3.png).
* [Science](https://i.imgur.com/l9d8O59.png) is that method whereby you [figure out](https://i.imgur.com/TyZbGRC.png) the [rules](https://i.imgur.com/X4noIDZ.png) that are [behind things](https://i.imgur.com/2D4EnpY.png) (minor S01E01 spoilers).
* [Science is fundamentally pragmatic](https://i.imgur.com/Yu6SKvn.png).

Some of these, I might mention or comment on in passing while saying quite a bit more on the others. So, what does Senku get right and what does Senku get wrong?
#Is Senku right about hypothesizing, experimenting, and replication? Let’s find out.
#Is Senku right about hypothesizing, experimenting, and replication? Let’s find out.
Senku claims that **science involves hypothesizing and experimenting over and over, slowly, to refute another character’s claim that science was epistemically failing them.** Is it true that these are **necessary** (Senku seems to be claiming that these are necessary rather than sufficient conditions for science; the latter claim would be a bit more untenable) **conditions for science?**

There’s a lot to be said about whether hypotheses and experiments are necessary to science, but I think I’ll give Senku those since I think the last part is a bit more interesting (and it’s a bit harder to adjudicate what exactly Senku means with the former components, and some ways of interpreting it might run into issues with cases like Bell’s theorem).

Science seems to **centrally** need replication and reproducibility, does it not? That’s why, after all, the purported replication crisis we’ve had for some time now seems so fundamentally *troubling* for science.

But as historian of science Friedrich Steinle will note, while replication is *important,* it’s not so essential that science can be accurately described as the process of hypothesizing and experimenting over and over. Sometimes, you hypothesize, do an experiment, and there’s no demand for replication at all, which, by Steinle’s lights, appears to be a correct judgment. So as it turns out, science’s relationship to replication and reproducibility is *incredibly complex,* and a great deal of research by historians, philosophers, and social scientists has been necessary to understand this relationship.

Steinle offers an example, noting that “The first vacuum pump was designed and put in operation by the Magdeburg mayor and former technical advisor Otto von Guericke in the 1650….Guericke’s apparatus was unique, complicated, expensive, and difficult to handle….In any case, it is clear that replication was not an issue for Guericke; but even without replication, no doubts were raised about his results. This had probably to do with his public performance that could be witnessed by a large number of participants.” There’s no reason to think that the common sense of scientists at the time was wrongheaded. The judgment that replication was unnecessary in the case of Guericke’s experiment, and unnecessary to science overall, seems to be a very strong datum that it is, in fact, not necessary. This doesn’t mean replication can be *neglected* or that it’s *unimportant,* Steinle himself will note that it’s clearly necessary in all sorts of cases. But here, it was not. The need for replication is incredibly contextual, and it is not a part of the necessary or sufficient conditions of science.

Indeed, there may be no such things as necessary or sufficient conditions of science. To elaborate, let’s consider the two related claims that science is fundamentally about figuring out underlying rules, and that it is the “pain-in-the-ass” method by which we discover those underlying rules.
#Getting directly at the several millennia old issue: What is the essence of science, and what does Dr. STONE get wrong about science?
So, what about those two claims?

They’re actually precedented. What Senku is claiming here is rooted in a mish mash of historical events, but, as I’ll demonstrate, what these events teach us is actually that Senku is rather confused about what it is that science is. First, we’ll need to talk about the problem we’re grappling with here, then the history of the problem, and finally what we can draw from that history.
##What’s the problem?
What we’re dealing with is called the demarcation problem, and it’s a problem we’ve been facing for over two millennia. It’s an incredibly important problem, and is the engine behind a great many events in intellectual history. The importance of this problem to those events is to such a severe extent that some historians or those interested in history have considered it disappointing that those events are taught without this incredibly necessary context.

So, what is the demarcation problem and why is it so damned important that it’s so central to so many historical events? Briefly:

* ***The demarcation problem:* The problem of figuring out what is and isn’t science.**

Why is this so important? Well, science has a lot of epistemic weight. Since the ancient era, we listened to scientists. When they said something was going on, we took them at their word. That is, they have epistemic authority. We teach our children, as well as adults, what the results of science were and what scientists are doing today. We fund scientists. And we do all of these things to science in a way where we don’t do it to that which isn’t science; we rightly pass on scientific knowledge and not pseudoscientific knowledge, or at least we try or purport to.

Short of the infeasible task of getting all legislators and everyone else familiar with every branch of academia and its pseudo-counterparts, sufficient to distinguish science from pseudoscience, we’re gonna need a demarcation between science and non-science.

With that in mind, what are some things we want from a theory of what demarcates science and non-science? For ease of reference, I’ll call these **desiderata** from here on out.
###The **desiderata** of demarcation
I’ll not only be going over the desiderata of demarcation, but why those desiderata are justified. A demarcation between science and non-science should:

1. **be in line with actual scientific practice,**
2. **provide the necessary conditions of science,**
3. **provide the sufficient conditions of science, and**
4. **explain the normative properties of science (i.e. why it’s so valuable in all the ways we think it’s valuable.**

So , **why do we need to satisfy all four desiderata?** I’ll consider them one by one.

**(1) Why should a solution to the demarcation problem actually describe scientific practice?** A solution should aim to fit within the sciences those paradigmatic sciences such as physics, chemistry, and biology. For consider if the demarcation only purported to show some non-actual, ideal demarcation. How would a solution do any of what we want it to then? If physics isn't a science, then our desire to take physicists to be authoritative cannot come from our desire to take scientists in general to be authoritative, since that desire corresponds to non-actual scientists.

**(2) Why should a solution to the demarcation problem provide the necessary conditions for science?** If it only gave the sufficient conditions, then certainly, we'd be able to know when some investigation isn't pseudo-scientific, is authoritative or worthwhile as such, etc. But now, we'd have no ability to know when some investigation isn't pseudo-scientific, shouldn't be paid any heed, shouldn't be funded, etc.

**(3) Why should a solution to the demarcation problem provide the sufficient conditions for science?** If it only gave the necessary conditions, then certainly, we'd be able to know when some investigation is pseudo-scientific, isn't authoritative or worthwhile as such, etc. But now, we'd have no ability to know when some investigation is pseudo-scientific, shouldn't be paid any heed, shouldn't be funded, etc.

**(4) Why should a solution to the demarcation problem make it clear why science is valuable?** If all we're doing is just coming up with some unimportant, formal distinction between fields, the problem wouldn't be any more important than demarcating between various sciences. Sure, we think there's a difference between physics and biology, but if it came to light that this wasn't the case, would it matter, and would everyone focus intensely on figuring out the demarcation? A solution to the demarcation problem should let us know what to fund, who to listen to, etc.

So, without further ado, here is the history of answers to this problem.
##What have we already tried?
It’s a little ambiguous what exactly Senku is saying, but I think I have a good idea of what he might be trying to get at. So I’ll try to go over the history (with much thanks to Larry Laudan) independently of Senku’s thoughts, and then offer my comments on what Senku is trying to get across.
###A. Aristotle
So, with the four desiderata in mind, what solutions have been provided throughout the history of philosophy and science to the problem? What did people think was the difference between science and non-science? We can trace this problem back to Parmenides of Ancient Greece. Concerns about the difference between episteme, or knowledge, and doxa, or mere opinion, loomed large. Aristotle provided a solution in his *Posterior Analytics,* positing that scientific knowledge had to involve indisputable, complete, absolute certainty. After all, if scientific beliefs are as uncertain as the rest of our beliefs, it's not obvious that there would be any hard divide between scientific knowledge and mere opinion.

He also thought that scientific knowledge must involve more than knowing how to do things, but knowing why those things work. I may know that trees lose their leaves in fall because of wind blowing them away, but this is not scientific knowledge. I must demonstrate how this occurs from more fundamental, general causes for scientific knowledge. So, scientific knowledge would be deeper, like the knowledge that less sunlight limits chlorophyll which is needed for leaves to stick to trees.

In other words, science had to be “derived from first principles,” so to speak. You can think of Aristotle’s “first principles” as something like the most basic laws of nature. What Aristotle had in mind *specifically,* was the prevailing geocentric theory having to do with elements. This part of history may be a little more popularly known than some of the other parts. Back in the day, the universe was thought to be geocentric; the Earth was at the center. Why? Was this just some sort of self-importance on our part? No, this seemed to best explain a lot of the phenomena we were witnessing. There were four fundamental elements. There were heavy, Earth-y things, or Fire-y things that went up. But up, down, etc. in relation to what? The Earth. Everything they observed seemed to have the Earth as a “telos,” as Aristotle would say. And they could *see* that. They could apparently sit down and observe, over and over, that all Earth-y objects have, as their telos, the Earth while Fire-y objects went away from the Earth.

So, they were certain of that much. There was no denying that there were four elements, that interactions between these elements and the rules they played by explained all phenomena. So, if it could just be demonstrated that something was *entailed* from these first principles, such a thing could be known for certain just like these first principles.

For science, we need principles which we are certain of and can logically derive facts of the world from, and we need to know what is fundamentally happening, on a deeper level, with our observations. This is what gives us absolute certainty.
###B. Seventeenth and eighteenth century
By the time of Galileo and Newton, the need to figure out what was fundamentally going on at a deeper level was no longer taken to be needed for science. Galileo refused to figure out why what he was saying was true, but all the same, he knew what he said of free-falling bodies was true with absolute certainty. Newton similarly didn't claim to know why the celestial bodies moved the way he said they did, but he said he was coming up with theories directly from the phenomena and so he was sure. He wanted to know why, but felt that was unimportant to his theories being scientific.

There were two driving forces behind dropping the second demarcative component devised by Aristotle, and keeping only certainty. First, it didn’t match up with the sciences. By this time, and even before, by the time of Ptolemy, mathematical astronomy was not at all deriving the trajectories of the celestial bodies from first principles. Astronomers were simply figuring out correlations between the movements of the celestial bodies and other bodies, the seasons, and so on. Explanation from first principles was no consideration at all. Some bit the bullet that astronomers just weren’t scientists, but this was a hard bullet to bite since it seems rather clear that we should listen to astronomers.

Second, there was an extremely worrying revolution that shook every scientist and philosopher to her core. The fall of geocentrism and the very first principles that all scientific knowledge had been derived from since then. After this, there was very little agreement over how it was that scientific knowledge was absolutely certain. René Descartes was someone who famously sought to show how we could have scientific knowledge. Certainty was very important, hence he dug down to find a belief in which he was certain, which he thought was his famous Cogito: I think, therefore I am. He thought we could derive all of science from *this,* and that’s how we could be certain of scientific knowledge. This wasn’t a fruitless endeavor. While he developed this attempt at demarcation, he discovered a lot that we still use to this day. For instance, it was Descartes who came up with science as being concerned with mechanisms and laws of nature, something physicists still do today. Prior to then, science was an investigation into teleology and purpose, not mechanisms and laws. This was a fundamental shift in our empirical investigations, one that has persisted in all sciences and one we can thank Descartes for.

When David Hume potentially showed that we couldn't even form any justification by which we could derive our predictions from just our observations beyond practical need, Immannuel Kant freaked out and spent the rest of his life coming up with an entire system of philosophy meant to show how science could be justified to a point of certainty as well as metaphysics as a science, which was concerned with only a small set of questions which could be answered in metaphysics (anticipating later attempts to throw out metaphysics, he too threw away much of it).

Newton, Kant, Descartes, Locke, Bacon, etc. argued all the time, then, over how it is scientific knowledge is infallible. But nobody denied that, of course, it was, if done right, infallible. If they just figured out how to do it right, they’d obtain certain knowledge.
###C. Nineteeth century
By the nineteenth century, the fallibility of all of our beliefs became dominantly accepted, and so this solution could not do any longer. But if not complete and indisputable certainty, what could distinguish science from non-science? Researchers in the nineteenth century tried to demarcate science from non-science via method. There must have been some identifiable scientific method by which it could be shown that some pursuits were scientific and some were not.

The scientific method, they reasoned, could still be fallible, could still lead to mistakes, and so on, and so there was no threat of making the same mistake as the infallibilists of all the eras before them. But this method of testing would allow us to correct ourselves so that we could keep progressing despite our mistakes in our pursuit of knowledge. This attitude can be summarized in E.V. Davis’s pithy remark that, “""if science lead us astray, more science will set us straight.”

To be clear, the idea that there was some specific method of going about scientific investigation was not a new idea. But the idea that it was fallible, but still the best method of forming knowledge, *was* new. So, everyone tried to figure out what was in common between the sciences, and how it was that this method was better than other methods of trying to figure things out. Various proposals were made, but all of them were not only vague, they didn't even actually match what scientists were doing. Furthermore, nobody was able to explain how their proposed methods were better at forming knowledge than any of the other proposals.

Now, it is taken to be the case that there simply is *no such thing* as ""the scientific method."" Despite this, as noted in the following two links (also check their citations, especially Bauer's *Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method*), many science educators and the public at large still act as if it exists:

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-method/#SciMetSciEduSeeSci
###D. Twentieth century
So, certainty doesn't work. Fundamentality doesn't work. Methodology doesn't work. Maybe distinguishing science and non-science via semantics and meaningfulness would work.

This was a large part of the attempts of the members of the Vienna circle, a group of scientists and philosophers who started a movement known as **logical positivism.** Logical positivism was an incredibly complex movement, which few contemporary summaries do justice. But to give an idea of the movement, I’ll briefly discuss their motivations and two prominent formulations of one of their central theses.
####FORMULATING EARLY LOGICAL POSITIVISM
**Logical positivism** rose with the apparent increase in success of **scientific, logical, mathematical, and linguistic** investigation. Feeling the need to throw out all of philosophy which did not appear to show the promise of similar success, logical positivists aimed to restrict what sentences were meaningful down to much less. This would, in effect, allow them to put front and center the sciences, the mathematics, and so on, throwing out what they took to me nonsensical metaphysics. You can consider this a birthplace of certain scientistic cultural elements which persist to this very day.

It should be made clear that the logical positivists came off the heels of an era of philosophy where philosophers would make claims like ""The absolute is perfect"" or ""Nothingness nothings,"" which the logical positivists saw as just a bunch of pseudo-poetic nonsense, as evidenced by their lack of any form of measurable success against their scientific counterparts, who made claims like ""This is the data we should expect from this experiment."" The logical positivists were much more sympathetic to the latter form of claims. They really seemed to mean something and weren't just apparently pseudo-poetic word salad, and they really seemed to be getting at some sort of success.

Another causally relevant factor was that Bertrand Russell had a significant influence on how the logical positivists thought of philosophy in the Medieval era. Russell would often mischaracterize them because he really hated them, and many of the logical positivists simply trusted Russell’s account after Russell became a central figure in philosophy due to his immense contributions to logic, mathematics, and the philosophies thereof. So, they aimed to throw away much of medieval philosophy too, which we know now was a grave mistake on their part, perhaps even more problematic than their belief that the claims in the previous paragraph were meaningless word salad.

**In short, scientific investigation was good, nonsensical metaphysical investigation, whatever that was, was silly.**

With those motivations in mind, in what follows, I will explain early logical positivism and its death as briefly as I can. I can elaborate should anyone be interested in these problems, but I suspect nobody will be, and so I will cut myself short on each part.

Early logical positivists defended the **verificationist criterion of meaning,** meaning they believed that all declarative sentences were:

**A. Analytic:** True or false in virtue of the meanings of the terms (e.g. ""All squares have four sides,"" ""All ravens are birds"").  
**B. Empirically verifiable:** Logically entailed from some finite set of possible observation (sentences), or could in principle be verified by some finite set of observation (sentences).  
**C. Meaningless.** It’s difficult to make out exactly what this means, but importantly, it meant that something wasn’t worth investigating.

This account *failed.*

**First,** it couldn’t account for sentences of universal form, or sentences of the form “All *F* is *G,*” or “Each *x* is such that if it is *F,* it is *G,*” or to put it symbolically, “(∀x)(Fx⊃Gx).” For example, claims like “All stars emit light” or “All electrons repel other electrons.” These weren’t true or false in virtue of the meanings of the terms alone, nor was it possible for them to be entailed by some finite set of observations (or rather, the sentences for those observations).

**Second,** it couldn’t resist the addition of meaningless disjuncts. Via disjunction introduction, the purportedly meaningless sentences could be added on without problem.

**Third,** it made certain claims about the same very same thing, of the very same subject, etc. meaningful while their counterparts were meaningless. For example, “unicorns exist” would be meaningful under this criterion, while “unicorns don’t exist” would not be. Why? Well, you may know that all positive statements are logically equivalent to some negative statement. This is often brought up when someone debunks the myth that “you can’t prove a negative.” But perhaps less known is that you can take this further: negative existential statements are logically equivalent to some positive universal sentence, such that negative existential statements run into the problem of being sentences of universal form, and thus (as previously demonstrated) meaningless.

A demarcation which distinguishes between “unicorns exist” and “unicorns don’t exist” as scientific or not is deeply, and perhaps fatally, problematic.

**Fourth,** Gödel's theorem, often summarized as truth outrunning provability in formal systems, demonstrated that for any language with a finite set of axioms (and inference rules) that let you do some arithmetic, some sentences within that language can't be proven or disproven. This meant that, contrary to the hopes of the logical positivists, mathematics couldn’t all be accounted for analytically via a small set of syntactic rules.

**Fifth,** the early criterion was self-defeating. The criterion itself was neither analytic nor empirically verifiable. So, if the criterion was correct, then it was meaningless. Otherwise, it was incorrect. A.J. Ayer’s defense against this claim involved taking “meaningless” to be an academic term of art, simply *defined* a certain way, but that would mean that it has nothing to do with whether something is worth investigating or whether some research was worth respecting.

**In short, early logical positivism faced a lot of problems, any of which were individually fatal to it, which prompted later developments.**

Later on, many logical positivists (though I emphasize again the incredibly diversity of the movement) defended the **translatability criterion of meaning,** meaning they believed that all declarative sentences were either:

**A. Empirically translatable:** Translatable into an empiricist language, which, following Hempel, I'll denote as *L.*  
**B. Meaningless.**

What does it mean for a sentence to be translatable into language *L?* This can be left a little bit open, so that various languages are proposed which would satisfy the motivations of the logical positivists. But Hempel considers a specific proposal for *L* that he thinks at least approaches being a serious contender. *L* is any language wherein:

**C. The vocabulary of *L*** contains **(i)** logical expressions like ""if...then,"" ""not,"" ""and,"" ""or,"" ""all,"" ""some,"" and so on, **(ii)** certain observation predicates, where observation predicates are terms which designate directly observable characteristics like ""green,"" ""soft,"" and ""taller than,"" and so on, and finally **(iii)** any expression which can be defined via the terms of i and ii.  
**D. The syntax of *L*** is the syntax of some contemporary logical system, like that of the Principia Mathematica.

**If you don't quite get that, that's fine;** the basic idea here is that there is this language which is entirely restricted to sentences which would describe something we can observe and investigate. It has to be about a direct observation, or something that a direct observation implies. If you say ""Hey, my good is green,"" I can do some science on that claim and be like ""Yep, sure is, Sam-I-Am,"" or ""Nope, I am afraid you are outside of your mind with respect to the coloration of those items, my dear friend Sam-I-Am."" If you say ""Hey, this glowing stuff is radioactive,"" then even though I can't directly observe radiation, I can do some science on *that* claim too because it entails certain direct observations.

Hopefully, that gives at least some blurry shape to this criterion.

**This solves all of the old problems (will elaborate if needed), but comes with fatal new problems.**

**First,** it can’t account for dispositional terms like “fragile.” We can do this today thanks to the advent of possible worlds semantics (which is also how we know, with nearly unanimous consensus, that there exist other possible worlds), but even that probably wouldn’t have helped the translatability criterion.

**Second,** by the 1950s, plenty of highly sophisticated theoretical abstracts simply couldn’t be defined or reduced to observation predicates. These include terms like “wavefunction” or “electric field.”

**Third,** accounting for inductive inference syntactically made inductive inference relative or underdetermined by anything other than language. Inductive inference is central to our everyday lives. When you decided to eat food rather than drink arsenic for nutrition this morning, you inferred from what you’ve observed what experiences you haven’t observed would be like. Any theory that can’t account for this is wrong.

In response to problems like this, even later thinkers would allow for theories which had any observational component(s) at all, so long as the rest of the theory was broadly, appropriately, liberally related to those observational components.

But of course, research in metaphysics, much like theoretical physics, *does* do that. This marked the end of the anti-metaphysics and anti-philosophy of logical positivism, as it was demonstrated despite their best efforts that **it seemed impossible to demarcate between the sciences and metaphysics.** Later on, logical positivism died.

What were some other attempts worth mentioning in the twentieth century? Karl Popper thought that maybe the sciences were falsifiable while the non-sciences weren’t, but this position is as dead as logical positivism. Others thought that science was unique in that it progressed, while non-sciences didn’t, but this doesn’t turn out well at all either. Others interpreted science pragmatically and as having to do with its useful and practical applications, but this didn’t work out either.

Others have done great work on how these failed, but with this section dragging on a bit, I’ll just note for one of them that clearly, plenty of non-scientific fields progress, like literary criticism, metaethics, history, foundations of quantum mechanics, military strategy, etc. We certainly know more in those fields than we did a century ago, it’d be absurd to tell a military general otherwise. On the other hand, plenty of sciences don’t or didn’t progress for a very long time, tentative candidates brought up by Larry Laudan being: “acoustics from 1750 to 1780; human anatomy from 1900 to 1920; kinematic astronomy from 1200 to 1500; rational mechanics from 1910
to 1940.”

Perhaps an even bigger problem with some of the attempts in the twentieth century is many of them, Popper’s and A.J. Ayer’s in particular, **failed to meet the fourth desiderata.** They became much closer to simply esoteric distinctions without implications.
###E. Do we have a solution today?
So, are we still trying to figure out the demarcation problem now? Or did we figure it out? I think it’s the latter. But insofar as we’re trying to understand what Senku says (he never does touch on the correct answer), this is likely mostly irrelevant for our purposes. But I’ll make a few notes here so as to not leave readers unsatisfied, then move on.

The contemporary answer usually involves giving up necessary and sufficient conditions altogether. This is as revolutionary as it is deeply problematic for practical reasons. Let me offer a historical fact that I’m uniquely situated to give. Once upon a time, there was a United States Supreme Court case meant to decide once and for all whether creationism should be taught in schools. The answer is, of course, that it should not be.

So, the supreme court brought in a very well known expert on the matter: Michael Ruse. Michael Ruse was going to adjudicate on what was and wasn’t science for the purposes of the United States Supreme Court, and was going to change the world with it. What was Michael Ruse’s answer? Something like logical positivism.

Why did he do this? Well, Michael Ruse happens to be my professor’s professor, and so I have a bit of insight into what Ruse was thinking here via what he said when his student asked him about his decision to give a false answer to the demarcation question when he was asked for the goods.

Here’s the problem. The newer answers have no necessary or sufficient conditions. The Supreme Court can’t work with that. But obviously, *we need to keep creationism out of schools.* The older answers lacked the normative component, and also were demonstrably not the correct necessary and sufficient conditions, but you could *work* with them. You could clearly adjudicate on what was and wasn’t science for legislative purposes.

But even if all the answers involve quite a bit of vagueness, resistant to the sort of judgments practically necessary, we do have answers. These days, demarcative questions involve quite a bit of vagueness. Laudan himself suggests simply giving up terms like “pseudoscience” and “non-science,” researching only into what knowledge is and isn’t reliable. So, on the one end, you have fields like history, metaethics, literary criticism, biology, foundations of quantum mechanics, modal semantics, mathematics, causation, and so on. These fields give us reliable knowledge. Then, closer to the other end of the spectrum, you have things like social Darwinism, creationism, Myers-Briggs typology, objectivism, acupuncture, conversion therapy, and so on. These fields, theories, topics, etc. don’t give us or involve reliable knowledge.

And then, between the reliable sciences and non-sciences, it’s not uncommon (though not unanimous) to see another sort of spectrum. On one end, you have research that might be thought of as more “direct” or “observational.” Further away, you have more theoretical fields. So, modal semantics, the foundations of quantum mechanics, moral ontology, causation, physical cosmology, and so on.

In short, many contend that the search for strict demarcation has ended, for better or worse, contrary to what Senku seems to want.
##What does this mean for Senku? Why is he wrong? (Summary included)
Senku claims that the basis of science is figuring out underlying rules. But as we’ve seen, this Aristotelian view of science didn’t work out so well. Now, of course, one reason was that our understanding of underlying rules wasn’t infallible, which is hardly a problem for us today, seeing as we’re fallibilists. But another is that plenty of sciences simply *don’t* look for underlying mechanisms explaining the phenomena, etc. I gave the example of astronomy, which for the longest time did no such thing. There are plenty of other examples today. Indeed, many *physicists* complain that this is the case for large swathes of their field.

He also expresses a belief in **the scientific method.** But after intense research in the nineteenth century, it doesn’t seem like there’s any such thing. Throughout history, much research, being done clearly as it ought to be, didn’t involve many things often purported to be methodologically necessary, like replication or hypothesizing.

Anyway, I’d love to write more, and if enough people find any part of this interesting, I *plan* to write more, whether to elaborate on certain things I cut short here or to answer the other questions I listed that the show tackles. But you gotta make the cut somewhere.

All in all, despite these inaccuracies, I don’t want people to be left with the notion that this show is overall scientific hogwash. While it gets its central and fundamental questions wrong, the research into other areas are pretty detailed.

I’d love to talk to the mangaka, Riichiro Inagaki, about all of this. I wouldn’t just bring up the flaws I just mentioned, but my adoration of the show and the aesthetic context it exists in. I’d want them to understand both these flaws and what an incredible achievement with respect to representations of science it is. But alas, I have no way of communicating to Inagaki at this time! Maybe one day, hey?

Anyway, to summarize like I did in the other sections, the show explores a lot of topics central to **what science is,** two of which are:

1. What is the essence of science?
2. Does science have a specific method to it? If so, what?

Here’s a brief answer to both:

1. Not any of the main answers prior to the last few decades.
2. No, “the scientific method” is a myth (though fortunately, scientists are [listening more and more](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4522609/) to experts on the matter) and there’s likely no such thing, though often useful for teaching those unfamiliar with science about it.

**Senku has something of a mish mash between Aristotle's, Descartes's(?), and the nineteenth century account, and unfortunately, all of these have been debunked.**

Hopefully, everyone’s gained something from all of this. Let me know and let me know if it’s worth writing the rest of what I’d like to write about on the matter. :)

""One phenomenon feminist historians have focussed on is the rape and torture metaphors in the writings of Francis Bacon and others (e.g. Machiavelli) enthusiastic about the new scientific method. Traditional historians and philosophers have said that these metaphors are irrelevant to the real meanings and referents of scientific concepts held by those who used them and by the public for whom they wrote. 

But when it comes to regarding nature as a machine, they have quite a different analysis; here, we are told, the metaphor provides the interpretations of Newton's mathematical laws: it directs inquirers to fruitful ways to apply his theory and suggests the appropriate methods of inquiry and the kind of metaphysics the new theory supports.

A consistent analysis would lead to the conclusion that understanding nature as a woman indifferent or even welcoming rape was equally fundamental to the interpretations of these new conceptions of nature and inquiry. Presumably these metaphors, too, had fruitful pragmatic, methodological, and metaphysical consequences for science. In that case, why is it not as illuminating and honest to refer to Newton's laws as ""Newtons rape manual"" as it is to call them ""Newton's mechanics.""

In it the author states that General Relativity is undermined by ""white empiricism"". She claims that general relativity states that ""there's no single objective frame of reference"", making ""all observers equally competent"", but that that is undermined by the low number of female physicists, particularly black females.

She claims that studying string theory is a form of white supremacy, since according to her it's a discipline in which ""wild speculative claims"" by ""white scientists"" are taken more seriously than ""the idea that Black women are competent observers of their own experiences"". Also, apparently, the failure of string theory rests not on the exponential number of solutions or its lack of background independence, but that physicists studying it are ""too homogenously white"".

# R1

There exists some controversy around whether or not moderate drinking is particularly harmful. Let's start with the CDC recommendations:

https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/moderate-drinking.htm

First, the CDC focuses a lot on the intoxicating effects of alcohol and the secondary health problems that causes. That's actually good! The last thing we want is a bunch of poorly-informed health nuts swerving in and out of traffic daily because they just pounded 3 vodka shots for the gainz. Alcohol alters your consciousness, and while this is often the point, there is a time and a place for that. It's not anywhere and every day.

Second, the effect of alcohol on the liver shouldn't be understated. While it's usually chronic heavy drinking that produces liver damage, you can seriously accelerate the process for even mild drinking based on external factors: you have aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 deficiency (aka flush reaction), you take medications that are hard on the liver while drinking (e.g.: some NSAIDs), or you have known or unknown occupational exposure to some toxin that your liver is kept busy purging from your body.

Finally, the CDC correctly notes that many cancers are associated with any alcohol consumption at all. ""Cancer risk"" is pretty abstract and hard to quantify though, so it's understandable that one wouldn't discuss it.

Now, onto the material the leangains article cites:

- Leangains argues that moderate consumption improves insulin sensitivity and lowers triglyceride concentrations using two studies. One is a study of a little over 1000 Japanese non-diabetic non-hypertensive people. Another is a study of 63 postmenopausal women. 

Both the studies are interesting to be sure, but curiously are focused on their own subset populations. The authors of the insulin sensitivity study phrased their conclusion: ""Our findings suggest a close association between insulin resistance and the incidence of hypertension in Japanese. However, alcohol modified and reduced this relationship."" Nothing about a general improvement in insulin sensitivity, and certainly not a linear relationship.

This tactic is frequently employed in nutritional media- implying a linear relationship between the amount of something and a quality or quantity of purported health benefit for all people. Nothing is mentioned about the fact that it's exceedingly likely that these subjects metabolize alcohol completely different from most westerners. There's certainly nothing mentioned about the ""three drinks per day"" that OP cites.

I'll happily address any of the other studies cited in the leangains article, but by and large it looks like the author went on google scholar looking for studies that supported their preconceptions and wrapped them in language like ""studies have shown time and time again"". Even if there is a redeeming nugget in one of those studies, it's interpreted so poorly by the author that it might as well be buried treasure.

I'm not going to go into the alcohol-testosterone effects because I'm not 100% convinced that the author is wrong in attempting to debunk that. There's a lot of garbage pop-science about Testosterone and Estrogen being affected by this and that (soy comes to mind) which rests on awful methods, ignorance of endocrinology, a media establishment with low standards, and a reader base without good sense.

# Conclusion

The worst part about this is that I'm not sure any of the bad science was necessary for the author to make the point they wanted to make. Instead of making the case that alcohol was a miracle cure to cancer, had he just said ""it's not as bad as the fitness community says it is"" it could have been much more sound.

And genuinely, it can have benefits! If you work out and get muscle pains, alcohol is a fast acting and tasty muscle relaxer. It genuinely reduces psychological stress which could be seriously toxic on its own.

Basically, if you don't drink, this article shouldn't convince you to start, because the health benefits that are cited are bullshit. Social lubricant? Sure. Stress reducer? Absolutely.

[Scientific fraud](https://vdare.com/articles/franz-boas-liberal-icon-scientific-fraud)—falsifying scientific data or manipulating the scientific evaluation process—has become a serious problem. At best, it is a threat to public confidence in science. At worst, if the fraud is not revealed, then [public policy](https://vdare.com/posts/prosecutors-argue-iq-tests-must-be-biased-against-blacks-so-it-would-be-racist-not-to-execute-black-killers-with-iqs-70) could be shaped by [bogus data](http://www.eugenics.net/papers/Gottfredson.htm). This problem is universal. But there are distinct national patterns. In particular, fraud is endemic in non-Western countries—and among [non-Western scientists](https://vdare.com/posts/more-south-asian-media-backscratching-guardian-s-alok-jha-reviews-angela-d-saini) who [immigrate](https://vdare.com/articles/john-derbyshire-time-to-stop-importing-an-immigrant-overclass)here.

The most [infamous](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/magazine/diederik-stapels-audacious-academic-fraud.html) scientific fraudster of recent years did come from the West: the Dutch social psychologist [Diederik Stapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diederik_Stapel) At the time of writing, he has had to retract 58 scientific articles in which he made up or manipulated his data. Significantly, many of these were politically useful from a Leftist perspective, such as the claim that a dirty, untidy environment made people more racist or that people who [eat meat are more selfish than vegetarians.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diederik_Stapel) \[[*RETRACTED ARTICLE. Coping with chaos: how disordered contexts promote stereotyping and discrimination*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21474762), By D. Stapel &amp; S. Lindenberg, Science, 2011\]

Clearly, any sensible scholar is going to be very cautious about citing anything ever written by Diederik Stapel, even if it has not been retracted. Indeed, lay readers should be careful to ask for the author of [any Leftism-helpful social psychology finding](https://vdare.com/posts/more-convincing-ways-of-saying-girls-are-as-good-as-boys-at-math-won-t-make-it-true), when told about it by acquaintances, lest its author turn out to be Diederik Stapel.

But—breaking news—microbiologist Elizabeth Bik [just went public](https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2019/11/05/concerns-about-papers-from-annamalai-university/) alleging astonishingly massive scientific fraud, between 2004 and 2019, among academics at Annamalai University in Tamil Nadu in India. This may lead to the retraction of up to 200 papers by microbiologists at the university.\[ [*Research fraud in over 200 Annamalai University papers, alleges US scholar,* ](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/research-fraud-over-200-annamalai-university-papers-alleges-us-scholar-112362) *by Megha Kaveri,The News Minute, November 15, 2019*\]

And this is much more typical. Scientists from some countries are systematically more inclined to make up data or corrupt the peer-review process, than are scientists from others.

This particular report has been referenced in countless conservative news outlets like the National Review, the Daily Signal, etc. Like last time, I will try to keep my breakdown of the article as apolitical as possible, so I will not be discussing the flaws and merits of Medicare-for-All nor will I be making any value judgement of it.

[In this report](https://donotlink.it/GGOXL), the authors produce a damning conclusion that ""3 out of 4 Americans will be financially worse off under Medicare for All"" and that the government ""will take roughly half of your paycheck"". Seeing as Medicare for All is supported by some of the leading democratic primary candidates such as Elizabeth Warren ^(\[1\]) and Bernie Sanders ^(\[2\]), is what the Heritage Foundation concludes accurate and are those candidates just delusional? No. Not even a little bit, and this is due to a few dirty tricks they pull:

1. **They assume that Medicare for All will only be funded by increases in payroll tax**. Since payroll tax applies to virtually every salaried worker, this makes it much easier for the authors to conclude that every American will pay more. However, this is so detached from reality it's insane. No proponent of Medicare-for-All plans on funding it this way. Elizabeth Warren's funding plan includes trillions of dollars from a wealth tax on wealth over $1 billion, decreasing military spending, and a new corporate tax ^(\[3\]). Now you can argue that parts of her plan are unrealistic but the fact remains that funding for Medicare for All will almost certainly come from a wide variety of sources- not just on a direct payroll tax. This means that the study's calculated tax burden on working families is much higher than what it would actually be.
2. **The authors neglect to factor in cost-savings of a Medicare-for-All system.** The authors essentially transferred current private and state healthcare funding to the federal level and then added the cost of what it would take to insure those who are currently under-insured or uninsured. However, a Medicare-for-All system has major benefits that the authors neglect to mention. A study from the University of Massachusetts has shown that Medicare-for-All system could cost *19% less* relative to the current system due to savings in administrative costs, pharmaceutical pricing, uniform Medicare rates, and reduced fraud ^(\[4\]). The study does not take any of this into account, leading to inflated costs for Medicare-for-All.
3. **The study ignores health outcome benefits due to increased coverage- and the associated savings.** Previous studies have shown that expanded coverage under the ACA led to decreased emergency room visits, improved self-reported health, and increased primary care ^(\[5\]). The benefits of increased coverage, including improved access to primary care, have been shown to reduce costs and increased productivity: all of which further decreases the net costs of Medicare-for-All ^(\[6\]).

The Heritage Foundation manages to conclude that Medicare for All would make most families poorer by posing a completely unrealistic scenario where the entire cost of Medicare for All will be borne by working adults. Moreover, they inflate the net cost of Medicare-for-All by ignoring the increased efficiency in a Medicare-for-All system and ignore the financial benefits of better health outcomes that Medicare-for-All would create.

Another concern is how they give the data, a very concise and reusable way of giving information from my point of view, but it is possible this information could be misinterpreted and misused.

So, what's your opinion about this? Do they have any significant flaw in their information? Is the presentation a correct way of handing over information?

Looking back at it, I made assertions and a basic summary, but that was it. So reposting this and including more information.

In this video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKdKst4yV2w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKdKst4yV2w)), Chrisiousity asserts RPR of being pseudo-science because RPR shows bs ""journal articles"" on their Twitter account.

@15:50 Chrisiousity talks about autoethnographies where she can sort of see where RPR comes from, and then goes on to defending autoethnogerraphies as a whole.

The autoethnography which is being shown on RPR's Twitter account is this one - ""  Living in the in-between as an Ismaili Muslim woman: an autoethnography:"" [https://dspace.library.uvic.ca/handle/1828/9292](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&amp;redir_token=VR8gvQIzeYpjj7R8rlehGMjtwBZ8MTU3MzcxNTY0MEAxNTczNjI5MjQw&amp;stzid=UgwvQS-uQehW7TMFsBZ4AaABAg&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fdspace.library.uvic.ca%2Fhandle%2F1828%2F9292) 

This autoethnography read like some sort of personal diary which a 14 year old kid wrote up. The author of this nonsense avoided the playground in school, her inability to dance as she froze in place (pages 3-4), the author describes how how she glances around her apartment and noticed the vastr array of books about feminist theories, using a feminist lens within research methodologies (pg. 17) and if if that wasn't bad enough, she goes on to describe how the mandala process (in other words, drawing circle patterns on paper) allowed for a a more unique connection with herself... That was on pg. 45-46

The rest of this autoethnography does not get any better either - the other 150 pages are as full as crap as the first 50 pages were - which is in of itself an achievement, because the first 50 pages were atrocious.

&gt;""What a curious argument Dawkins gives regarding the ""poor design"" of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Is he not aware that the nerve does more than innervate the larynx? It gives branches to the cardiac plexus, esophagus and trachea in addition to the muscles of the larynx. Hence its circuitous route is necessary and not inefficient. I do thyroidectomies all the time and have to be careful not to injure any part of the nerve during the dissection, not just the branches that serve the larynx. Also, the superior laryngeal nerve does give a direct connection to the larynx, and complements the recurrent laryngeal nerve and provides redundancy in function, so a more direct pathway already exists.""

Oh goodie you can read wikipedia
Off course just because it has a function, doesn't make it good design: https://sensuouscurmudgeon.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/imperfect-design-casey-v-richard-dawkins/#comment-16775
https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2019/03/02/the-recurrent-laryngeal-nerve-as-evidence-for-evolution/

If anything it misunderstands the purpose of design, efficiency.

&gt;There are unusual conditions in which either the right or left recurrent laryngeal nerves do not loop around in the chest but rather directly innervate the larynx. In such individuals, there is the potential for significant problems in swallowing and breathing. Ironically, if you subscribe to the evolutionary paradigm, such conditions may represent example of mutations that regularly occur but yet evolution ""chooses"" not to select out for the more direct route!

Interesting...so they admit it is bad design but say ask ""well why doesn't evolution select for the better design huh?""
The answer being while evolution is powerful...it goes for the ""quickest"" solution, not the most ""efficient"" 9ne. If the design hypothesis was true, we would see that instead of what we have 

&gt;""Dr. Michael Egnor, a well-known neurosurgeon, has noticed and commented on this as well.""
Really? 

Wrong!

&gt;One would think that atheists and the non-religious, of all people, would agree with applying animal biology theories to humans. After all, they don’t think that humans were created by God.

&gt;But for some reason, most atheists are likely to adhere to Equality and feminism, and to think that everyone is the same, that racism is bad, that sexism is bad, that women can do everything men can do and so on — which is contrary to what can be observed in the animal kingdom.

&gt;It would be funny to ask them about this.

&gt;How can humans be that special while at the same not being that special?

Sigh, look at animals and see that there is gender equality: https://theconversation.com/how-understanding-animal-behaviour-can-liberate-us-from-gender-inequality-102981

So I apparently decided to refute this in the comments a couple years ago, but I'll update it here.

TL;DR Knows next to nothing about physics, dismisses proper physics with buzzwords, uses fallacies galore, pseudoscientific, hypocritical.
PS He looks like Trump.

Overall criticisms:

1) ~~If he isn't criticizing the physical equations, why is he speaking? The interpretations of quantum mechanics don't matter. The predictions do.~~ The interpretations of quantum mechanics *do* matter, but when one wants to propose a new theory, one has to show differences with the current theory, or show that the current theory is self-contradicting, and then propose a new theory that fits the data and has no extraneous details. Gaede's proposal does not fit the data.

2) He uses ""irrational"", ""just a concept"" and ""mathemagician"" as buzzwords to dismiss anything, any explanation, or anyone he thinks is wrong. He knows he will never be able to convince people quantum theory and relativity are wrong so he uses ""irrational"" to replace it to (hopefully) fool people.

3) Argument from personal incredulity and strawmanning. Most of his arguments reflect his limited imagination rather than the invalidity of physical concepts, which, may I remind everyone, have turned out time and time again to predict phenomena accurately.

Onto the specifics: 

7:50 The two-particle universe &amp; Quantum won't understand Pull

Quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) says he's wrong. Particles interact via quantum fields. The fields transfer the information of the charge and thus tell particles how to interact. While quantum theory is unable to understand gravity yet, it does not mean it will never be able to do so, which is what Gaede is implying.

9:00 Field &amp; love analogy

Entirely disanalogous. The field *is* what causes the attraction. The field *is* what leashes the dog to the dog house.

9:30 What is the physical mechanism?

The field *is* the mechanism. He seems to think that this doesn't count, but that's his problem.

10:15 ""The atom is mostly empty space."" -Ernest Rutherford

Crackpots love refuting old scientists. They almost never try to refute the most up-to-date science. What Rutherford said is ~100 years out of date. It, I assume, refers to the planetary model of the atom, in contrast to the plum pudding model proposed by JJ Thomson.

But people who still say this conflate what happens when we measure the atom with what happens when we aren't measuring the atom. The electron wavefunction fills space, and that is what the electron is.

10:50 His criticism of ""mathematical physics""

Ever since Newton, physics has been about using mathematical equations to describe and explain reality. If physics is not mathematical, it's not physics. Sure, there are qualitative explanations (see above), but it is based on mathematical models of reality.

In response to reification: This gets into philosophical territory. What would you consider ""real""? We're pretty sure QFT+GR (the ""Core Theory"") isn't everything, since they're incompatible. Both have problems with infinities even internally. (QFT solved it with renormalization, GR still has singularities.) But whether or not they are ""really real"", they still are accurate descriptions of the universe, and treating them as though they are real in suitable regimes would be sensible.

12:50 Draw energy.

He's so against ""reification"" he is using the reverse. Just because someone cannot draw energy does not mean energy does not exist. Draw love. Or air. Or siblings. Not *your* sibling, *siblings in general*. You can't do that, but they exist.

Energy is the quantity that is conserved under time-translation symmetry. If the laws of physics are constant from one moment of time to the next, energy is conserved.

And one last thing: Wouldn't someone drawing energy come up with a glowing ball with rays shooting out of it?

13:45 The nature of mass

I feel like the quote at ~14:00 is taken out of context. I speculate that the quoted person was trying to illustrate how mass is independent of volume or the number of atoms in a thing. We know what mass is. It is the energy something has at rest.

14:40 The nature of time

The classical view of time is the order in which events happen. Other definitions exist, including the direction in which overall entropy in the universe increases, or the direction away from the Big Bang, or the direction in which light moves. Entropic, cosmological, and radiative time respectively, all of which coincide. In relativity, time is a dimension experienced differently by observers at different velocities or accelerations.

16:10 force ""carrier""?

Yes, the gauge boson field does carry the force. Gaede's ridicule of the phrasing does not carry his point across, and only demonstrates his disrespect for anything he has not understood well enough. (I wonder how he would react to the Dirac equation?) And indeed, this is ""irrational language"", as he put it. The English language fails to accurately describe reality, so it must look irrational. Attacking the language instead of the model is... What's the word for treating something that isn't real as if it's real... Oh right, reification.

Gaede also conflates the classical use of ""force"" with its quantum use. The classical force is causes acceleration. A quantum ""force"" is a type of interactions ""carried"" by different gauge boson fields, which include radioactive decay, which isn't a force in the classical sense of the word.

17:30 Points

Again with the reification. Obviously a dot on the blackboard is not a 0-dimensional point. A point is an object, or a location with (or that tends to) no dimensionality, i.e. with length, width, height, time, and any possible higher dimensions equalling 0. Just because people can't draw an exact point doesn't mean the concept of a point is invalid.

And he can accept planes but not points? It's just the difference between one dimension equalling 0 and all dimensions equalling 0.

19:10 ""They're all misdefined.""

And I think we all know who's doing the misdefining.

20:05 Spacetime is proven.

Correct. Space and time (not just perceptions thereof) are both affected when travelling at different velocities or at different accelerations. He also conflates the concept of spacetime with the question of whether there are 3 space and 1 time dimensions. The fact that space and time are related is, well, a fact. That there are more dimensions is a proposition of hypotheses such as string theory.

20:10 The peer-reviewers censor you for doubting spacetime.

It's probably because spacetime has been experimented with so many times, and still stands scrutiny. Oh, and also:

IT'S ALL A CONSPIRACEH!!

20:50 Arrow of time

Again with the hypocrisy. For one who condemns reification, he sure loves to use it. He might not have noticed what the cursor is. It's an arrow. We use arrows to indicate direction. If his stupidity were not so infuriating it might almost be funny.

And for the record, the ""why"" in ""why is there an arrow of time?"" is not the same ""why"" as ""why are we here?"" It can be reformulated as ""what causes events to unfold in the direction of the arrow of time?""

21:40 Physics is about explanations.

And Gaede just called ""whys"", the answers to which are explanations, ""philosophy questions"".

22:00 ""Science does not explain. Science describes.""

Well, he is correct to an extent. Science is a collection of descriptions and explanations. Laws are descriptions. Theories are explanations. One phenomenon's description is another's explanation. For example, spacetime curvature is a description that explains why massive objects attract each other.

23:20 Even if you have the perfect equation, what did you explain?

How forces came to be. How gravity arose. How particles interact with each other. Basically everything. Sure, you could say it describes how these things happen, but in the end, all explanations either are circular, form an infinite regress of explanation, or end in a brute fact.

24:35 How Martian car wheels are invisible
""Martian wheels give off UV"" is a description of what causes them to be invisible.

And just because it gives off UV (I'm not even going to ask why they glow) doesn't mean it's invisible. If it only gives off UV and reflects nothing else, it should look black as it, well, doesn't reflect any other light. This ignorance of how light works displays his hopeless ignorance of actual physics. The fact that they put ""physicist"" under his name is a disgrace.

Side note: I seriously doubt Martians are able to make cars if they don't understand magnets.

26:45 Quantum says IT'S A FIELD!

This is disingenuous. QFT explains how the field leads to magnetism.

The electrons in the iron atoms of the magnet all have spin. The unpaired electrons have spins aligned in one direction. This cumulative effect of aligned electron spins creates a significant magnetic field, which means it's a magnet.

27:35 2000 years of physics

Nitpick: Physics has only started existing since Gaileo. So Gaede's off by a factor of 5.

28:05 The question is action at a distance.

Warping of the gluon, photon, and W and Z boson fields for the strong, electromagnetic, and weak interactions respectively, and warping of spacetime for gravity. At least that's the answer for now.

Physical objects: quantum fields and spacetime

Nitpick: That's not a question.

29:00 We can't explain how two rocks stay together.
Reminds me of ""Tide goes in, tide goes out. You can't explain that."" from Bill O'Reilly. Curved spacetime makes the Moon go around in that particular way. The Moon at that particular velocity views the orbit it's going in as a straight line. Turns out I can explain that.

The trick is to pay attention in undergrad physics.

30:25 Photoelectric effect

Description: When light of a short-enough wavelength strikes a metal surface, electrons are ejected. (NOT ""a current runs through"".)

Explanation: Particles of light (photons) strike the metal surface, transferring energy to the electrons which now have enough energy to escape the metal surface.

30:55 Light checklist

Travels straight: Light does travel in a straight line. It's just that subsequent photons do not travel in exactly the same direction. If you take a snapshot of a spinning light that shoots photons in the radial direction, the photons would look like it's come out of a water sprinkler, but if you focus on one photon, it travels in a straight line. 

Oscillates: The electromagnetic field's strength oscillates as there are numerous photons travelling, making it a wave.

Obeys Maxwell's equations: Again, only when there are many photons travelling together.

Has mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields: I thought he thinks fields don't exist? Electric fields are calculated from its effect on charged particles. Electric fields require magnetic fields to exist alongside them. This is only evident when it is exposed to an electromagnetic wave. A real photon would only interact with charged particles by emission or absorption.

Has a frequency, wavelength, and amplitude: They do have those.

Obeys c=fλ: They do obey the equation. This is a description, not something that can be explained. Why can't we bring both of them up and travel faster than the speed of light? Well, because you're talking about light? Light, by definition, travels at the speed of light. Semantics aside though, Light can't travel faster because photons are massless particles and all massless particles travel at exactly 299792458 m/s.

Gaede is attempting to apply a classical approximation to the more accurate, quantum version of electrodynamics. Of course the quantum one doesn't fulfill all of the requirements. It's like saying sin(π/6) is not equal to π/6, so the sine function is wrong, rather than realizing sin x = x is just an approximation for small angles, and π/6 isn't a small angle.

34:15 EM rope

In what way can we detect the rope? If it cannot be detected, it is just a concept. His ""rope"" is just as conceptual as he claims fields and waves to be, as it is not a rope made of physical threads.

So he's saying light can't shoot off into nowhere. Sounds like special pleading to me. Occam's razor should take care of it.

By his model it seems that what we plebeians call light emission and absorption are identical. So I am Cyclops now? I do love laser eyes

In classical electrodynamics, it's the electric and magnetic fields that are waving. In quantum electrodynamics, it's a stream of photons.

37:58 Light checklist for EM rope

Stretches rectilinearly: This does not correspond to reality.

Oscillates around axis: Defied. It does not oscillate. It rotates. While EM waves increase in amplitude then decrease to zero, his EM rope has the same amplitude all the time, just rotated at different angles.

Obeys Maxwell's equations: Defied. Electric and magnetic fields are already present and thus are not induced.

Has mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields: Defied. They are not perpendicular, they are opposite.

Travels at c: Defied. Transmits information of position instantaneously, as it stretches rectilinearly. In addition, his demonstration does not correspond to his model. The rope is made to oscillate, while his EM rope rotates. However, if this is taken as a valid analogy, then light speed should increase with increasing frequency, just as pressure waves travel faster with increasing frequency.

This explanation for speed (tension) is also ad hoc, as the tension variable can be adjusted to fit reality, rather than deriving light speed as is the case with Maxwell's equations.

41:45 Ropes tie every atom on the Earth to every atom on the Moon

Which means the Moon should orbit at a fixed distance. But its orbit is elliptical. Thus his model is bunk.

The Sun does not have atoms, per se. The Sun is a plasma.

And perhaps most importantly, the electromagnetic force only gives interactions between charged particles.

Side note: https://what-if.xkcd.com/140

42:30 ""What tests can we run?"" ""Well, there is no test.""
And that, my friends who have the patience to read this wall of text, is why this is pseudoscience.

43:20 ""If we assume it is mediated by a rope, we can understand it.""

""If we assume it is mediated by [insert preferred mediator here], we can understand it.""

&gt;What is the teleological purpose of “attraction”? Riley J. Dennis is talking about genitals — “what’s between their legs” — and therefore we might ask, why do genitals matter in terms of “attraction”? Do you really need me to explain this? Didn’t your mother give you the where-do-babies-come-from talk when you were a child?

&gt;Unlike kids at Whittier College, when I was in school, we not only studied grammar, logic and rhetoric, but we also studied science

&gt;Sex is about reproductive biology. Human beings are mammals, and any eighth-grader can figure out what that means in terms of sex.
Once you understand this scientific definition of sex, everything else is just details. Young people have to figure out how to attract potential partners, how to choose a good partner from among the prospective candidates, and how to negotiate a relationship that will lead toward lifelong monogamous pair-bonding — i.e., a successful marriage — because this is the ideal situation in which to raise children.

Ummm...no: https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-wellbeing-of-children-with-gay-or-lesbian-parents/

In fact alloparenting occurs in nature as well...https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/147470491301100202

&gt;This is very simple. Sex is about procreation, and therefore sexual success can be measured. There are winners — the ones who are blessed, in obedience to the divine commandment — and there are losers.

&gt;All of my ancestors were successful in this regard, or else I wouldn’t be here. As the descendant of a long line of sexual winners, therefore, I have inherited a legacy of winning, much the same way the University of Alabama football team has inherited its own winning legacy. Carrying on that victorious tradition, I’ve got six children of my own — the oldest three already married, with two grandchildren so far — and dare to hope that future generations of my descendants will continue this reproductive winning streak.

&gt;Riley Dennis accuses those who disagree with him/“her” of “reducing people to their genitals” — you’re guilty of an ignorant prejudice if you don’t want to date a “woman” with XY chromosomes and a penis, you see. Perhaps the best reply to such an accusation is, “So what?”

&gt;How is your “transphobic” prejudice different from, or worse than, Riley J. Dennis’s blatant prejudice against normal people? Riley J. Dennis is abnormal, and expects the rest of us to tolerate his/“her” preference for female clothing and effeminate mannerisms. Most of us do grant such tolerance, so long as these weirdos stay away from our children. If you want to live your life like an extra from the cast of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, you are free to move to San Francisco and let your freak flag fly. And I’ll keep my kids 2,500 miles away from San Francisco.

&gt;America is a free country, see? “Riley J. Dennis is a polyamorous, atheist, gender non-binary transwoman . . . educating people on the nuances of gender, sexuality, and intersectional feminism,” and I am a Christian conservative father of six who says Riley J. Dennis is crazy.

You think biology is binary...when it really isn't...

&gt;In eighth grade, Justin Dennis decided he was an atheist, and now, at age 23, Riley J. Dennis has decided “she” is a “transfeminine lesbian.” Gosh, it’s almost as if there were a “strong delusion” involved here.

&gt; [The Myth of the Stupid Believer: The Negative Religiousness–IQ Nexus is Not on General Intelligence (g) and is Likely a Product of the Relations Between IQ and Autism Spectrum Traits](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10943-019-00926-3)

This was what I found when I looked into it:

""Likely a product"" is a pretty bold claim for a title since they didn't measure autism at all. They had inconclusive results they could not explain and then said ""maybe this is related to autism"" in the discussion. Pretty bad form to make that kind of a claim in a title if it isn't actually derived from your research results.

This is usually what a paper looks like that started with a hypothesis the results couldn't confirm, but they wanted to salvage and publish anyway.

I'd wager they wanted to link subtests of the IQ measure and low religiousness. It didn't work out that way, so they introduced an observation as the hypothesis: there is not a Jensen effect in the cross religion/culture groups. And then used that point, instead of relationship of IQ subtest scores, to say ""thus it is not linked to general intelligence.""

&gt; Given that the finding of an anti-Jensen effect seems to indicate that the differences between the groups are not on g, the key question is ‘What subtests may drive the intelligence differences?’ In Tables 3 and 4, the results of the subtests are provided. These results do not show a consistent pattern.

This is key, because if the non-religious tendency is predicted by a subtest we should see a pattern here. I don't think introducing ""well maybe it's autism"" in the discussion is a sufficient explanation. 

*[Around this point is when I wondered what kind of journal would publish this, since I knew it probably wouldn't cut it in mainstream psych journals.]*

I'd also point out that the *Journal of Religion and Health* has a low impact factor and almost all of its citations are in religious studies journals. It seems like a dubious place to publish research on IQ since there are so many well regarded journals across fields interested in IQ.

He's had a history of [denying climate change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDK1aCqqZkQ) and using [homophobic and racist slurs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/05/right-wing-youtuber-hurled-racist-homophobic-taunts-gay-reporter-company-did-nothing/) but this time, he takes a stab at presenting a scientific argument that goes so, so, wrong. He argues that veganism actually hurts the planet. Here is each of his points with the timestamps.

1. Vegan farming leads to soil erosion which could be reversed by  letting arable land lie fallow and returning it to grazed pasture for a period. [3:45](https://youtu.be/4m_THN4J5g0?t=225)

Here, Crowder argues that vegan farming leads to soil erosion, since you need grazing and browsing animals to rehabilitate soil. However, he completely ignores the fact that this is occurring in our omnivorous agricultural system today: our food production is dominated by industrial agriculture [that does nothing like the grazing](https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/land-use/industrial-agriculture) that Crowder talks about. Moreover, grazing is perfectly possible in a vegan food production system, the only caveat is that those grazing animals would not be eaten. There is also plenty of other methods to prevent erosion, such as [using compost](https://extension.uga.edu/publications/detail.html?number=B1200&amp;title=Compost%20Utilization%20for%20Erosion%20Control) or [excreta](https://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/1004) in place of chemical fertilizers.

2) Veganism will require importation of food from countries with less stringent environmental regulations. [4:22](https://youtu.be/4m_THN4J5g0?t=262)

This is the strange one. Yes, we will be importing food when we go on a vegan diet. *But we are also importing meat and animal products*. Unless Crowder somehow shows that we import significantly more vegetables than we do meats and that this leads to significant environmental degradation (which he doesn't), this point is moot.

3) Farming land for crops releases more carbon from the soil than grazing. [7:40](https://youtu.be/4m_THN4J5g0?t=460)

So this is true. However, he's comparing intensive agriculture to extremely low-impact grazing, which is not at all how we obtain the vast majority of our animal products. CAFOs( commonly referred to as factory farms) [account for 72%](http://www.worldwatch.org/rising-number-farm-animals-poses-environmental-and-public-health-risks-0) of poultry production worldwide, which is completely different from the idyllic pasture-grazed animals Crowder is envisioning. The other point is the keywords *from the soil*, which completely neglects the greenhouse gases emitted from grazing animals. As it stands now, beef generates [over 41x](http://css.umich.edu/factsheets/carbon-footprint-factsheet) as many greenhouse gases as rice per serving.

4) Grain production results in  at least 25 times more sentient animals being killed per kilogram of useable protein more environmental damage. [8:30](https://youtu.be/4m_THN4J5g0?t=510)

Now this is his most interesting argument. However, he based his number [on an article](https://theconversation.com/ordering-the-vegetarian-meal-theres-more-animal-blood-on-your-hands-4659) based on Australian food production, where 70% of beef comes from pasture-raised cattle. In any other developed country, cattle meat would almost definitely account for more sentient animals killed per kilogram of useable protein since cattle feed is predominantely made up of grains. The other thing Crowder neglects to mention is that according to the article, the vast majority of sentient animal deaths are from mice, generally considered pests and/or invasive species.

These were his four main points, and he goes off-track *a lot* but I tried to condense them accurately as best I could. You can check his points yourself by going to the time stamps next to each point.

The counter-argument that Crowder completely forgets to mention is that meat is an incredibly inefficient food source, requiring much more water, land, and feed to produce for the equivalent amount of grains. [One study has shown](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat) that  *800 million more people* could be fed with grain that livestock eat in the US alone.",True,False,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,20080.0,public,self,"Steven Crowder's ""EXPOSED: Veganism is WORSE for Planet"" and why it's wrong",0.0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/dcsxnl/steven_crowders_exposed_veganism_is_worse_for/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,1570205002.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of those is [Social Dominance Orientation (SDO)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_dominance_orientation). This is a personality construct that refers to a preference for extreme hierarchy and dominance over outgroups, as well as strong anti-egalitarianism.

I was alerted for a book review by Gerhard Meisenberg, published in *Mankind Quarterly,* that mentioned SDO. [(Link)](https://mankindquarterly.org/archive/issue/60-1/10) Critiquing a book by Angela Saini, *Superior, The Return of Race Science,* he wrote:

&gt; What  is puzzling  is  the title  of  her  book:  Superior.  Saini  has  written  an  earlier  book  entitled Inferior:  How  Science Got  Women  Wrong—and  the New  Research  That's Rewriting  the  Story  (Saini,  2017).  What  these  book  titles  reveal  is  a  preoccupation with  group-based  superiority  and  inferiority.  Personality  psychologists  call  this preoccupation  social  dominance  orientation,  an  attitudinal  dimension  that  is closely  aligned with  the  Dark  Triad:  narcissism,  Machiavellianism,  and psychopathy  (Hodson,  Hogg  &amp;  MacInnis,  2009).  From  the  perspective  of dominant  group  members,  social  dominance  orientation  predicts  a  preference  for assimilation  as  opposed  to  colorblindness  and  multiculturalism  (Levin  et  al., 2012).  Saini’s  book  can  therefore  be  examined  as  a  case  study  in how  social dominance  orientation  is  expressed  from  the  perspective  of  a  minority  group member.

Meisenberg is not a psychologist. This still doesn't explain how he got it so wrong. You can't determine ""a  preoccupation with  group-based  superiority and inferiority"" from two book titles. Further, SDO is not merely a preoccupation. Researchers of hierarchy and group dominance aren't doing research because they score high in SDO. SDO marks a clear *preference* for hierarchy, in group domination and anti egalitarianism.

When I read the rest of the book review I saw a lot of jargon misapplied this way. Who would publish this. So I looked up *Mankind Quarterly.* Turns out it's not considered to be a credible journal. Meisenberg is the editor-in-chief. The journal was founded in the 40s to openly promote scientific racism and eugenics.

&gt;With apologies for the pun, this is a shell game. The availability of calcium carbonate does not explain shells, just as the availability of bricks cannot explain houses. Surely the most interesting question is how animals use the materials to build the intricate shapes and mineralized body plans. Where is the blueprint for a trilobite, a mollusk, or a brachiopod? Accounting for material does not explain the elegant conch shell with its golden ratio geometry.

Where the explain how it works.

&gt;Darwinism resists falsification because the parameters are all adjustable. “Early species developed much faster than previously thought,” they say. By simply declaring it to be so, the rapid diversification confirms Darwinism rather than falsifying it. Just move the dial labeled “speciation rate” from slow to fast. Problem solved! The dial goes all the way from static to explosively fast. Darwin can’t lose.

&gt;Yes, it is very fascinating to be able to tell a whopper like this without blushing. 

&gt;On it goes. The museum includes exhibits on molecular clocks, Lawton says, but that evidence contradicts the age of these fossil, and assumes evolution (circular reasoning). The museum includes exhibits on “developmental genetics” (presumably evo-devo) which also assumes evolution, and does not explain where the information for new hierarchical body plans and systems came from.

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) 1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

[Here](https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2019/08/23/climate_alarmists_foiled_no_us_warming_since_2005_110470.html) is the article the reddit post links to.

I first want to say that I am not trying to make a political statement even though the post is from a conservative subreddit; I will just focus on *why* the post is bad science. So, let's begin.

Before I actually dive into the disgrace that is the article, I'm first going to present irrefutable evidence that global climate change is occurring which can be found in [here](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/) which uses data from the GISS. There is a clear and dramatic increase in global average temperature that is actually accelerating in recent years. With that out of the way, here is what the article actually says.

&gt;No U.S. Warming Since 2005

Even from the title, you already can see that the authors are trying to cherrypick data. Rather than looking at *global* climate change (which is the most important issue), the authors focus on just the United States. The time scale is also dramatically reduced. Climate changes occur over the timespan of decades, but this article solely focuses on the last 15 years. Even with this cherrypicking, you will see that the authors are still completely misrepresenting the data they have.

&gt;In January 2005, NOAA began recording temperatures at its newly built U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN). USCRN includes 114 pristinely maintained temperature stations spaced relatively uniformly across the lower 48 states.

Now the authors are looking at a very interesting dataset from the USCRN containing 114 temperature stations. That may sound like a lot of stations, but keep in mind that this is spread out over an incredibly large area. States such as New Jersey, Connecticut, and Vermont [don't even have any USCRN temperature stations at all](https://www.atdd.noaa.gov/u-s-crn-groups-map/). The authors say that this is because other stations are near urban areas which biases the results. However, this is just wrong. Looking at the temperature measurements taken by the USCRN and the USHCN(which has [over 1200 stations](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/epubs/ndp/ushcn/ushcn.html)), you can see that the observations are [nearly identical](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/national-temperature-index/).

&gt;Strikingly, as shown in the graph below, USCRN temperature  stations show no warming since 2005 when the network went online. If  anything, U.S. temperatures are now slightly *cooler* than they were 14 years ago.

[Here](https://assets.realclear.com/images/48/487004_5_.png) is the graph they are referencing. Now this is probably the dirtiest trick the authors used, because a regular observer might see that the graph is flat and assume that means that the temperature is not increasing. However, the graph is not based on average temperature but on the *average temperature anomaly*, meaning how much the datapoint departs from the long-term average. So what's the problem? Well, even though the graph is largely flat, you can see that the *vast majority of datapoints are above zero*, meaning that most measurements showed warmer than average temperatures.

I did some digging and found [where the authors got the graph](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/national-temperature-index/time-series?datasets%5B%5D=uscrn&amp;parameter=anom-tavg&amp;time_scale=p12&amp;begyear=2005&amp;endyear=2019&amp;month=7). If you look at the past 2 years, only 36% of the measurements showed below-average temperatures with 64% of the measurements showing higher than average temperatures. This is a clear indication that warming in the US *is occurring.* Here is the craziest thing. Even though the authors point to the graph and say that US temperatures are slightly cooler, the statement bears *absolutely no relation* to the actual graph itself. I suppose they just wanted the reader to blindly trust them.

The article goes into other statements that departs from its core thesis which are equally crazy but I simply do not have the time to discuss all of them.

I’ve heard this idea tossed around and have never quite gotten my head wrapped around it. The claim that “human variation is a social construct” to me sounds absurd.

Here are several common claims I have found. I have been swayed, but I have yet to find something to change my view.

&gt;*Using very broad classifications will be pretty arbitrary because of how complex migration and interactions are. It is a continuum with no defined borders.*  
*There is no single point where you can say one groups stops and another begins*

Arguments like these are like saying ""There are no short and tall people, because it's a continuum! There's no specific height at which a short person suddenly becomes tall!""

&gt;*Variation in humans is not a spectrum distinct ends, but rather clinal variation with no definite points.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
*There is no single gene that marks any sociopolitical population, but a complex set of traits. This is why when mapping the genetics of humans, the reference points are going to be an arbitrary choice, usually with sociopolitical biases.*

Scientists don't choose any ""reference points"", genetic clusters simply appear in the data based on how different populations are from other populations.

&gt;*People’s observable features aren’t a social construct, but the way we then take gestalt impression of those features and assign the person to a broad racial category is a socially constructed response.*  
*This can best be illustrated by how a person’s race can change based on the country they’re in. Someone considered black in the US could be considered white in the Dominican Republic.*

Race is a completely unrelated matter, and can be pretty relative idea. They can change quickly, they are defined with borders set up, countries, tribes, social factors, ect.

Sure, you could call race superficially a “social construct” in the way everything can be treated as a “social construct.”

For example, in the US you have the black people and the white people.

In China you have mongol, uyghur, han, zhuang, manchu.

Singapore's ""Chinese, Indian, Malay, Other"".

And in the Berbers you have dozens of tribes.

In some cases these cultural groups have different observable features. Because they have different lineages coming from the Uralic people, the Berbers, or the Garoids of Meghalaya.

These are, morphologically speaking, the genetically distinct points, and have split about 85,000 years ago. All other ""variation"" is simply the result of various degrees of admixture from these points, that has occurred more recently.

For example, the whites of America are a physically and genetically diverse population. Europeans have a similar admixture pattern as well. These populations are the result of an admixture between Tataroids and Berberoids.

The blacks of America are primarily Berber. But genome mapping has identified admixture with Garoids, which has occurred in East Africa 3,000 years ago.

Source: [https://www.pnas.org/content/111/7/2632](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/7/2632)

&gt;[https://trid.trb.org/view/39458329](https://trid.trb.org/view/39458329)  
Anthropologists studied a group of burials in the Swiss alps and found them to have Tataroid features with some admixture of Berberoid traits, with distinctly Berberoid physical characteristics such as curly hair and bronzed skin. Excavation at the site, were far from genetic homogeneity showing both Berberoid and Tataroid traits. Five of the six skeletons that were complete enough for anthropometric analysis and they appeared Tataroid rather than Berberoid (Patel 1975, 2006)  
Using gene frequency data for 85 protein loci and 21 blood group loci, studies on the genetic relationship of the three major races of man, Tataroid, Berberoid, and Garoid, indicate that the groups diverged about 100,000 +/- 85,000 years ago. The genetic relationships of various races in each group of Tataroid, Berberoid, and Garoid were also studied. All Uralic populations are genetically close to one another, whereas many Oceanian and American tribes show large extents of genetic differentiation. The major cause for this differentiation seems to be the bottleneck effect. The Yupik, Inuit, and Cree are more closely related to the Uralic Tataroids than to the Garoids in India and Myanmar. There are also indications that migration played an important role in forming the current genetic relationships among human races. The extent of genetic differentiation between human races is not always correlated with the degree of morphologic differentiation. The genetic differentiation at protein loci seems to occur largely by mutation, genetic drift, and isolation, whereas morphologic characters are apparently subject to stronger natural selection than ""average protein loci.""

Some Europeans look almost distinctly Uralic, while some look more Berber. Many look somewhere ""in between"" the two, as if they had a Berber mother and an Uralic father. But surprisingly, that is not the case as they may actually be from the same country. The striking diversity is the result of a melting pot between the Uralic people and the Berbers in Europe.

Sometimes this variation can be within the same family, this is a photo of single a European family, with both distinctly Tataroid and Berber type of traits:

&amp;#x200B;

Far from genetic homogeny, the Han, Japanese, Vietnamese are diverse groups as well, mixed from contact between Garoid and Uralic peoples.

https://i.redd.it/cs9ep6ze89i31.jpg

Heres an interesting point that I've heard brought up a few times:

&gt;*You could take people in the Caucasus Mountains as a baseline reference, call them Caucasoid.*  
*Now take people in Mongolia, call them Mongoloid.*  
*You can now compare the rest of the world to these reference points. If you graph the degree of similarity on a chart, it gradually fades out from the points, but in a misleading way because there is nothing that backs up the reference groups for comparison.*  
*Americans, Europeans, and people from English speaking countries for example, are more familiar with further East Asians, Europeans, and Sub-Saharan Africans. They would most likely perceive Tatar people, or Central Asians as being the mixed looking ones, not the other way around.*  
*They would likely describe Berber people as appearing mixed between black and white.*  
*Groups are often arbitrary, and chosen for sociopolitical reasons important to those making the claims.*

""Caucasoid/Mongoloid/Negroid"" is the least supported and silliest of all the megafamily “hypothesis”. Completely ignoring the history and genetics of all the peoples involved.

It takes the Caucasus (an Uralic-Berber melting pot near Europe), and then just ""throws in"" the Mongols, primarily of Tatar origin, but with some contact with Garoids migrating up from the south.

Here are some other types of claims I have heard:

&gt;*There is more genetic variation within any group than there is between groups.*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*The entire human population has just as much gene pool diversity as a single town in any country.*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Attempts to measure genetic distance are invalid without first measuring genetic distance between individuals within the groups. Genetic difference alone does not demonstrate anything, and using it to make taxonomical claims is completely pseudoscientific.*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;S*ome traits like are recessive and need high frequency to be expressed, or else will rarely show up despite the alleles still being found in the population.*

The claim that all human populations are equally diverse genetically is absurd and simply impossible.

The first Berberoid humans originated in Africa. Later in a mass bottleneck event occurring 100,000 +/- 85,000 years ago, some Tataroid-like people migrated north, while the first Garoids migrated east.

These people have gone through significant bottlenecking, and with the generally accepted standards used in Taxonomy, differences in phenotype and genetic distance can be used in the classification of Subspecies. Additionally, it is often debatable whether a population should be classified as a subspecies or a species.

&gt;*Where someone looks like they are from is meaningless, with immigration, adoption, crazy situations, someone could even resemble another group by complete chance.*

An Uralic person trying to speak Arabic is not only cultural appropriation, but painful to watch. A dog born in a stable isn't a horse.

Genetically definable common lineages are a different matter than ethnicity, calling them ""social constructs"" would be simply absurd. There is clear evidence that both brain structure and function may affect culture. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3409833/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3409833/)

&gt;*Human traits are in clinal variation, which always demonstrates substantial gene flow. The combination which traits are inherited in is completely meaningless from a genetics standpoint.*  
*All traits are individual human traits. They do not serve any biological purpose together, you simply learn to recognize certain traits together in people.*  
*In some pacific islands, many people have very dark skin in combination with blonde hair.*

The idea that human traits are all trivial, and can be mixed and matched in any given way is false. Europeans, who often have curlier, Berber like hair in combination with more Tataroid facial features have increased rates of Toscana virus. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3320356/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3320356/)

This is similar to how ligers, a result of interbreeding a lions and a tiger, can have problems such as infertility, though of course not to the same extreme.

&gt;*For tens of thousands of years, millions of human have been scrambling around. And its often on the very general level. Say for example a family of 5 moves to the next city over. There is no way to scientifically sum up all these billions of interactions in any synchronized way.*

It is very much possible in the case where there is a mass event, either a bottleneck or large separation gap, which in the case of humans is the north and eastward migration events out of Africa.

&gt;*Modern geographical terms like Africa were only recently defined with borders. Human migration was an expansion, not a synchronized candelabra. Maintaining gene flow by migrating outwards as fast as migrating inwards.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*With the complex migration pattern of humans, significant bottlenecks shouldn't occur on continent sized scales.*

https://i.redd.it/zeupqsom59i31.png

This map demonstrates the two populations that have branched off from Berberoids as the result of two major bottleneck events, as well as the more recent admixture.

Although, the out of Africa theory is still in the stages of a theory. A proposal that, Garoid population centers didn't actually evolve from Chimpanzees as demonstrated in the first Humans, but rather bonobos. And perhaps the reddened Tataroid phenotype originates from Ailurus fulgens.

Other news organizations have also reported on this bullshit, but this one is especially bad.

The whole idea of freezing the oceans to stop sea level rise is absurd
to begin with.  The main idea of the people promoting this plan is that
since salt water has a lower freezing point than fresh water, then if we
could only get rid of all that pesky salt then we wouldn't need to worry
about the arctic melting so quickly.  Basically they want to create some
sort of ice-nine-bergs which on the surface _maybe_ _kinda_
_theoretically_ doesn't make a _complete_ mockery of thermodynamics but
in practice it definitely would generate a shit ton of waste heat,
especially since they decided fresh water doesn't freeze fast enough in the arctic so
they need a ""giant freezing machine"".  lol.

However, I think the more fundamental issue is that even if we could
magically convert sea water into fresh water icebergs on a large scale,
all without generating any waste heat, the weight of displaced water
would be equal to weight of the iceberg due to the Archimedes principle.
Icebergs melting does not have a direct effect on sea level rise.  The
real problem is glaciers melting, not icebergs.  Literally bailing water
out of the ocean with a bucket would be a more effective solution.
Now to be fair, the project leader mentioned that these icebergs would
reflect light from the sun, so maybe the icebergs wouldn't be
_completely_ pointless if we actually could magic them into existence,
but the real problem is still the GHGs in the atmosphere.  Making a small 
patch of ocean in the arctic temporarily more reflective isn't going to fix that.

But that's just the tip of the iceberg as far as the bad science goes.
Responding to the author of the Forbes article, the project leader
addressed energy concerns, saying:

&gt; Besides solar cells, we see that perpetual motion energy must be developed, either the ones using kinetic principle, or magnetic energy. Some perpetual motion energy that was once made by humans, indeed can not produce a large amount of energy. However, if all submarine elements  – when bodies, walls, floors, etc – are formed from small panels of material in which using the principle of perpetual motion energy, and duplicated as much as possible, it will be possible to sustain the submarine energy requirements.

Now yeah, I do get it, the whole thing is probably a just a troll, but
what gets me and made me want to write two paragraphs of why the
entire idea is bullshit is that this isn't even addressed by the author
of the article.  They just seem to act like perpetual motion machines
are a reasonable answer to their questions.  I mean even for Forbes 
this is pretty bad.  The guy who wrote it apparently has ""written about
science and technology for 20 years"".",True,False,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,19762.0,public,self,[Forbes] Solving the climate crisis with perpetual motion machines,0.0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/csvn96/forbes_solving_the_climate_crisis_with_perpetual/,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'tiatTc3SaRjtpeOoX8lGmjIY1HG5ip0LIit60DS1Jv8', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FYsbSWWjhTSgEYnd6HsOJKCV4oetsyrC6pNPEdbIyCg.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c21a478328af14ea2af2d761b187b3e9d7b37f91', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FYsbSWWjhTSgEYnd6HsOJKCV4oetsyrC6pNPEdbIyCg.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88c1b27cf555d028428deb63f2ee6d58a0bf841e', 'width': 216}, {'height': 168, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FYsbSWWjhTSgEYnd6HsOJKCV4oetsyrC6pNPEdbIyCg.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c526a444eee0f0346fb4287b74f88fae5c6bf908', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 315, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FYsbSWWjhTSgEYnd6HsOJKCV4oetsyrC6pNPEdbIyCg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=19a7681ec1ea79ae298cf4b6d1e6d2b93951681d', 'width': 600}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1566379744.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last week, I vented my annoyance with the bad science from /r/science gaining tens of thousands of upvotes and reaching /r/all. I got way more attention and way more people expressed their own concerns than I expected. So, I have decided to continue showing people the terrible science that's everywhere in that subreddit.​

This time, I have a post that is just as bad as the previous, with 39.9k upvotes and a gold. Its title is: ""*People who experience anxiety symptoms might be helped by regulating the microorganisms in their gut using probiotic and non-probiotic food and supplements, suggests a new study (total n=1,503), that found that gut microbiota may help regulate brain function through the “'gut-brain axis.'*”

The study the reddit post is based on is a review of 21 other studies. Let’s begin.

Issues:

1. **Only 52% of the studies the authors reviewed actually supported the idea that regulating the gut microbiome could help alleviate anxiety.** This is coming from the original paper itself which says: “Overall, 11 studies showed a positive effect on anxiety symptoms by regulating intestinal microbiota, which indicated 52% of the 21 studies were effective”. This is *by far* the most damning of the problems with the reddit post. The post’s title is not only misleading but based on almost no evidence whatsoever. As you’ll see, there are still plenty of problems with this science but to make such grand claims when half of the studies reviewed *doesn’t* support you is just bonkers to me.
2. **There was no standard measurement of anxiety**. There were over four different questionnaires used to measure anxiety (HADS, STAI, BAI, HAM-A were the most common). Some studies used just one questionnaire, some used multiple, and some used questionnaires that none of the other studies used. The authors took all of these measures, and treated them all equally.
3. **The methods of regulating the gut microbiome were also completely different from study to study.** The authors grouped the regulation of the gut microbiome into two types: probiotic and non-probiotic. No probiotic treatment was the same. Treatments ranged from 4 weeks to 12 weeks long and the species of bacteria used in the probiotic treatment varied tremendously from study to study. The non-probiotic treatments are even worse. While the probiotic treatments at least shared the same general concept, the non-probiotic treatments were sometimes as different from each other as they were from the probiotic treatments. Some treatments prescribed a low-FODMAP(low in fermentable carbohydrates) diet to the participants, while others use scFOS supplements and some just did a different thing entirely.
4. **The studies are not generalizeable.**  Half of the studies were with participants suffering from IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). Now ask yourself this question: Is it more or less likely that participants who already have digestive disorders would experience large benefits from the regulation of their gut microbiome? The answer is obvious. Just five of the studies reviewed are with otherwise-healthy participants. The rest had one disorder or another.
5. **The studies the authors reviewed just don’t belong together.** This is a combination of the previous few issues. The studies use different subjects, have different treatments, vary in treatment length, and measure results differently just to name a few. With studies that vary this much from each other, nothing can be concluded from a review of them.

Overall, to say that the study suggests regulating the gut microbiome could alleviate anxiety is just plain misleading and wrong. To be fair, the original study's authors never says that regulating the gut microbiome could alleviate anxiety (although they do heavily imply it). However, the articles and reddit post based on the study go even further, and completely collapses the thin ice the study was already on.

Even if everything else was perfect, the fact that just 52% of the studies gave positive results means that much, *much* more work needs to be done before we can say anything conclusive between the gut microbiome and anxiety.

This is from a subreddit that calls itself ""The New Reddit Journal of Science"" which is a disgrace to the name of scientific journals everywhere. You can tell I'm pretty pissed but I hope that this example will show you why.

This is just one of the bad offenders. Here is the post title: ""After taking LSD or psilocybin, 83 percent of alcoholics no longer met the criteria for the disorder, and 28 percent credited their psychedelic experience for their lifestyle change""[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/bpqf9m/after_taking_lsd_or_psilocybin_83_percent_of/). This post has 2 reddit golds and 6 reddit silver.

So what's the problem?  Well hold on because it's gonna be a wild ride.

1. The way the researchers looked for participants is *extremely* sketchy. Here is what they did: they made advertisements that ""sought individuals who had 'overcome alcohol or drug addiction after using psychedelics'"". What does that advertisement imply? It immediately implies a causative link between psychedelic use and the overcoming of alcohol/drug addiction. The participants will also almost definitely skew toward people who believed that the psychedelics in some way helped mitigate addiction. Moreover, it only selects for people who overcame addiction after psychedelics use and actively excludes people who used psychedelics but did not get better.
2. Everything was done via an online survey. Now that's not necessarily a bad thing but as you see, it gets worse. The researchers *diagnosed alcoholism with a survey*. There's a huge number of problems with this. One, there's no way to tell if the respondent is lying or not. Two, the respondent's own biases could skew the results. And three (the most obvious one) *regular people are not knowledgeable enough to self-diagnose alcoholism*.
3. The survey tried to diagnosed participants with alcoholism an *entire year* prior to the study with the questionnaire. Not only were the researchers trying to diagnose people with alcoholism
4.  with just online SurveyMonkey questions (I'm not joking), but they're also asking people to remember what their alcohol/drug consumption was like a year ago. I don't need to tell you that this is very problematic.
5. Even ignoring the above problems, the results of the study are not generalizable at all. &gt;83% of the respondents had mental health disorders.  The vast majority were white (88.9%) and male (77.8%). We don't really know if these results apply to mentally healthy people, women, or people of different ethnic groups. In essence, the results of this study simply cannot apply to the overall population.

Of all of the problems, I think (3) is by far the most aggregious, with (1) coming in second. I can't imagine how many people must have been misled by this reddit post.

""If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge.

[ Historically, Europe has been a \\""melting pot\\"" of Berberoid and Tataroid peoples, leading to significant admixture and biodiversity, resulting in a population with a strikingly diverse phenotype, ranging from Berberoid to Tataroid in appearance. ](https://i.redd.it/6eib5nnbll831.jpg)

Anthropologists studied a group of burials in the Swiss alps and found them to have Tataroid features with some admixture of Berberoid traits, with distinctly Berberoid physical characteristics such as curly hair and bronzed skin. Excavation at the site, were far from genetic homogeneity showing both Berberoid and Tataroid traits. Five of the six skeletons that were complete enough for anthropometric analysis and they appeared Tataroid rather than Berberoid (Patel 1975, 2006)

The Romans of Europe were also of mixed origins. Meghalayan Anil Naidu argues that most of the Romans were of Berberoid and that less than 30–35% were of Tataroid stock. He sited the Latin race as being most common among the Romans. He classified Latins as a Berberoid type with significant Tataroid admixture, arising from the mixture of the Bashkir type of Tataroid features and the Paganists (Berberoid).

&gt;Each year, the reds came to the Mediterranean to spend the winter with them; then they took their wives and daughters and slept with them, among the other mistreatments. - Anil Naidu

Physical and genetic analyses of ancient remains have concluded that – while the Croats, including those in the eastern Croatia region – possessed predominantly features found (among others) in Beberoids, mixed, non-baseline human phenotypes were also frequently present, suggesting that the Corats as a whole were descended in part from Tataroid populations.

[ Distribution of autosomal DNA from the baseline centres of Garoids, Tataroids, and Beberoids when correlated to the rest of the world, displaying historical intermixing of the races of man. ](https://i.redd.it/4qjs9mvhll831.png)

  
Using gene frequency data for 85 protein loci and 21 blood group loci, studies on the genetic relationship of the three major races of man, Tataroid, Berberoid, and Garoid, indicate that the groups diverged about 100,000 +/- 85,000 years ago. The genetic relationships of various races in each group of Tataroid, Beberoid, and Garoid were also studied. All Uralic populations are genetically close to one another, whereas many Oceanian and American tribes show large extents of genetic differentiation. The major cause for this differentiation seems to be the bottleneck effect. The Yupik, Inuit, and Cree are more closely related to the Uralic Tataroids than to the Garoids in India and Myanmar. There are also indications that migration played an important role in forming the current genetic relationships among human races. The extent of genetic differentiation between human races is not always correlated with the degree of morphologic differentiation. The genetic differentiation at protein loci seems to occur largely by mutation, genetic drift, and isolation, whereas morphologic characters are apparently subject to stronger natural selection than ""average protein loci.""

&amp;#x200B;

A refutation I made to a creationist on their so-called ""polystrate trees.""  Basically, creationists use ""polystrate trees"" as ""evidence"" for a local flood because according to them, a world wide flood is the only explanation for how upside down trees can be found ""going through layers.""

&amp;#x200B;

As for your ""polystrate trees,"" this has been a creationist claim which has been refuted so often, it's a wonder why you lot keep on bringing this up. I will be using Acadian Geology: The Geological Structure, Organic Remains and Mineral Resources of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island - Third Edition as a source to refute your claim for this. First of all, ""polystrate trees"" aren't the correct term; Lycopodiopsida is the correct term for these ([https://archive.org/stream/acadiangeologyge00dawsuoft#page/192/mode/2up](https://archive.org/stream/acadiangeologyge00dawsuoft#page/192/mode/2up)). Although, I'm going to refer to these as their contractive term (lycopods), so I don't have to keep on using the scientific term, so please keep that in mind. I'd also like to point out that Sigillaria plants can also be found buried in such a manner too, and as these plants are in fact a Lycopsid (example being the Sigillaria in situ located in Pennsylvanian Joggins Formation), so I'm technically right by calling them lycopods. 

 

You incorrectly naming them isn't too bad though; I've only just learned the correct term for your ""polystrate trees"" this week, so you not knowing what they're called can be excused. Not a lot of people know about the correct term for these; and this is especially the case as creationists have pushed the title of ""polystrate trees"" for decades now. Even the Wikipedia page references ""polystrate trees"" which is a bit unfortunate, but I guess in the whole scheme of things, what they're called is irrelevant. Just thought I'd point that out to you though. Talos smite me, you might actually learn something here. Anyways, moving on.

&amp;#x200B;

What is not great though is your ignorance surrounding the circumstances of these lycopods and how they are buried. If we look to Acadian's Geology (the same edition referenced before), it goes more in depth into the circumstances surrounding the burial of these lycopods. The relevant pages are pp. 179-202 ([https://archive.org/stream/acadiangeologyge00dawsuoft#page/n225/mode/2up](https://archive.org/stream/acadiangeologyge00dawsuoft#page/n225/mode/2up)). This is the same book as I referenced before, but I’ve linked you to the beginnings of Chapter 12 so it makes it easier for you. Isn’t it interesting then that these lycopods are found in swamp deposits… Hum de la hum. Now, question. What are swamps and bogs infamous for? I’ll let you know, because obviously you haven't figured this one out. They flood. Regularly. Do I really need to state anything else on this matter? Even a moron could figure out why pointing to lycopods found in the carbonaceous remnants of a swamp and claiming that this is evidence against “evolution,” is stupid. No-one says that swamp deposits form over billions or even millions of years! Swamp deposits take mere decades to form. Honestly.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not as if you have to go out and by the book either; it's been archived on the Internet. And considering you've been doing this for 30 years, I really don’t know why you insist on bringing up these so called “polystrate trees.” I'm certain I'm not the first person that you've used this farce on, and I'm pretty damn sure you would have been brought up on this in the past. I find it highly unlikely that no-one would have told you the circumstances surrounding the conditions of these lycopods, even if they didn't use the correct term. It’s not something to have to look very far to refute either; Talk Origins has an article outlining this; I just decided to go into a lot more depth than Talk Origins did. The book I referenced was only published in 1878. That makes you approx. 140 years behind the current scientific consensus.

I recently found this video by John Stossel when I was trying to do some research on the Pebble Mine in Alaska. John Stossel is a climate change denier, but his disregard for science extends far beyond climate change.

In his video ""Stossel: Baby Salmon Threatened?"" published by ReasonTV, he makes several bizarre claims which show he doesn't know anything about salmon.

* He emphasizes the salmon being ""beautiful fish"" as the objection posed by the NRDC and other environmental groups. He never addresses the concerns waste from the mine would have on the thousands of jobs created by the fishery, which far outweighs the jobs which would be created by the proposed mine.
* He claims that the salmon won't be impacted because the mine is 100 miles away from Bristol Bay. I'm not sure if John Stossel understands this, but **salmon migrate**. They depend on clean spawning pools in order to lay their eggs after they swim upstream. If he simply watched a Magic School Bus episode on salmon he would understand this.
* This is more of bad political science, but he also only focuses on the ""rich environmentalists"" in the NRDC and completely ignores the concerns of local organizations and Native Alaskans who depend on the salmon runs to survive.",True,False,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,15877.0,public,self,Mining near rivers won't effect salmon because it's 100 miles from the ocean????,0.0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/c5bh43/mining_near_rivers_wont_effect_salmon_because_its/,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'PnVvU6_c0F9s5ZAxYBPhP2tvYfScTRyR7KHMSXqOOj0', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/f4wJoGCAUHecUm3BdLic5686xXh90i3fOeW2yLTeLMo.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b69246b8576ae51972e62dbd6ae6f9bdb0a7df13', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/f4wJoGCAUHecUm3BdLic5686xXh90i3fOeW2yLTeLMo.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e1fd0ea3001beaa6e08c01b20e9e8fde63fac07', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/f4wJoGCAUHecUm3BdLic5686xXh90i3fOeW2yLTeLMo.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90fada8a38bfa4aa29dea25c18f7996a0d525210', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/f4wJoGCAUHecUm3BdLic5686xXh90i3fOeW2yLTeLMo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=cb5f058c8c966841b2a6dadec88bed0ef009f0e8', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1561568041.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;1. Sandra Scarr and Richard Weinberg conducted some studies in the 70's where they tested IQ of black children adopted by interracial parents and followed up 10 years later with another IQ test. Early on it seems the kids benefited a lot from interracial adoption but as they came close to graduating high school the trends started to look a lot more like the normal IQ results we've seen in various studies by race. Different scientists argue about the interpretation but IMO it does seem to suggest that it's mostly genetic, especially when you consider brain development over time. You'll notice I link to wiki as well as the study and thats because it has a really simple graph there that lets you see what I'm talking about...because this study has lots of papers and honestly its pretty dense stuff. but if you want to you can find more pdf's of the study online.

&gt;2. Next, in 2005 Science Magazine published a report by Bruce Lahn who announced the discovery of gene variants associated with brain growth. He suggests they could've played a role in the development of civilization. The university of Chicago used his research to apply for a DNA based intelligence test patent.
What was found though, was that the gene variant was more common in Europeans and very rare in Africans. He soon stopped research claiming it was becoming ""too controversial.""
http://www.evolocus.com/Publications/Evans2005.pdf
&gt;3. Another scientist by the name of Rushton did studies on brain mass and IQ correlation. Him and a bunch of other scientists determined that , to keep it short, within the human species the more brain matter you have the higher your IQ generally. He found Asians had about 200ml more brain matter than Africans. 
This guy has very easy to find work including on .gov sites but I link to this article for convenience. Below the article you can see the references including other studies.

That one is a real doozy. 
Now, people can pick apart each study and come up with all kinds of excuses for why the results are what they are. But just consider...what are the chances that study after study we keep getting the same results over and over no matter what direction we seem to look at it from?

Now, one might consider an album in which Ol' Dirty Bastard claims to be ""fuckin' bitches by the chunk"" and uses a dog shitting on someone else's lawn as an allusion to scatalogical sexual acts 'low-hanging fruit'—and it is—but I don't care.

The issue with the above lines is the rejection of the well-accepted biological truth that [humans are indeed primates, and share ancestry with monkeys and apes.](http://incubator.rockefeller.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ape-evolutionary-tree.png) This is not, however, in any way an assertion that humans were at one point monkeys (which are distinct from apes), or that humans were 'swinging from trees', or even direct descendants of monkeys, as apes diverged from their simian cousins millions of years before we even begin to talk about hominid evolution. While the threshold at which humans *became* human is not exactly in the purview of science, our [shared ancestry with the chimpanzee](https://www.sapiens.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/04-Evolutionary-Tree-Bridget-Alex.jpg) moreover discounts the notion that humans are immediately descended from monkeys. It is also well accepted that anatomically modern humans (AMHs) are millions of years down the line from the divergence of the Homo genus from Australopithecus, as bipedalism became increasingly dominant and the part-time arboreal habitation of the latter became increasingly rare.

In addition to this, there is the obvious issue of the words 'ape man and the ape woman', which is taxonomically the same as saying 'man and woman', as [Homo sapiens sapiens are, in fact, apes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ape) Granted, in the context of this song, the meaning of this is caught up in theology and philosophy—but that doesn't negate the scientific ignorance.

&gt;… by the way I calculated the rotation rate of their space station which gives you artificial gravity on the outer rim. And it turns out it's rotating three times too fast. So if you weigh 150 pounds you'd weight 450 pounds on that space station (hee hee).

Two things wrong with this.

1) Actually do the calculations on a 150 meter radius hab making a revolution each 61 seconds and you get about 1/6 earth's gravity. Which is exactly what Clarke and Kubrick intended since the station was a stop on the way to the moon.

2) Spin gravity scales with the *square* of angular velocity. It's ω^2 r where ω is angular velocity in radians over time and r is radius. So tripling the spin rate would give you nine times the weight.

I thought I'd share the podcast with the folks here, since I thought it would be relevant. Here are some of the topics discussed, and a few selected quotes:

&amp;#x200B;

* Intro: Harry Potter and the market of personality tests
* The fun but unsettling consequences of personality tests
* Myers Briggs tests
* How the Myers Briggs test destroyed one's life 

&gt;And so after that anytime I made a mistake, or I said something, or had an idea, either my co workers or myself would say, but that's just because you're this personality type. Maybe there's a job better suited to your personality type and it made it so people didn't trust my opinion, didn't trust my ideas, didn't trust my conclusion, didn't trust what any action that I took throughout the day.  
Matthew says his colleague stopped trusting him, and he stopped trusting himself.

* How people feel personality tests (e.g. culture index) can be used to mis-categorize one's personality traits
* The origins of the Myers Briggs test
* Validity of Myers Briggs by top psychologists

&gt;There was a company in Canada not long ago, where there was a major acquisition made and the CEO gave every single person who was acquired the Myers Briggs, and then fired everyone who didn't match this type. That's terrifying.

* Argument for the Myers Briggs test by their proponents

&gt;Allen Hammer believes the Myers Briggs is as reliable as other personality tests.  
I hear what Allen is saying, but I would argue that these tests are popular precisely because they purpose is to give us a quick snapshot of who someone is and what they're good at. If you're a manager and you learn one of your employees is an introvert according to the test, it's absurd to think this won't shape the way you decide and whether that employee should have a public facing role.

* If personality tests are unscientific does it mean it's useless?

&gt;They talked about the Chinese zodiac and the power of the Year of the Dragon. They were sure that belief in the Zodiac was just superstition. In fact, they were certain that anyone who was born in the Year of the Dragon would actually be at a great disadvantage. If there is half a million more kids born in the in the Year of the Dragon, those kids will have more peers in the classrooms, there is going to be fewer resources per child in the schools, the classrooms will be a little bit more crowded, etc. We would expect worse educational outcomes rather than better. They decided to prove the hypothesis that dragon kids would fare worse than other kids at school.they found that in middle school, Dragon kids did better than their peers, They actually have higher test scores in in middle school. These kids also outperform their peers in high school.  
Okay, dragon kids were doing better because they had higher self esteem. So if everybody tells them or you are superior, you are smarter than everybody you are destined for greatness and good fortune.  
But when they looked at how children reported their own beliefs about their IQ, there was no difference between dragon kids and kids born right before and right afterwards. And dragon kids are not more confident about their own abilities or about their own future. In fact, the dragon kids weren't really smarter. They scored the same on IQ tests. So what explain their success at school?  
It turns out the success of dragon babies doesn't lie with the schools or the teachers or even with the kids themselves. It's because of parents like Shouqi and Yangcheng. From the moment Han Yu was born, his parents had sky high expectations for him.  
These beliefs become a self fulfilling prophecy. Parents who believe that kids are destined for greatness act in ways that help their kids achieve greatness.

&amp;#x200B;

* Does the hat put you in the house in which you belong? Or do you become the house the hat puts you in?
* Ending

&gt;As we've seen throughout this episode, it's extremely tempting to pigeonhole people. It makes the lives of teachers, colleagues and managers so much easier.  
The best friends and mentors do what the sorting hat did for Neville Longbottom. They see potential in us that we may not see ourselves.

They also mention oogenesis where a mature egg is created along with small cells with a single set of chromosomes called polar bodies that typically disintegrate.

At first I thought that's where the rabbit hole ended, but on a whim I decided to google the title that they are so fond of. It turns out that, in addition to shotgunning subreddits, the author is prolific across dozens of different websites as well: [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/310721304), [imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/DD0BX4R), [google plus](https://plus.google.com/117985317945445968248/posts/KiCKcNHLre7), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-sZ8V2qUiY&amp;feature=youtu.be) [even 9gag of all places](https://9gag.com/gag/aOYYb7r)!

They are especially prolific on Quorum (where all the best ~~/r/badscience material~~ scientific advances can be found) There is a user ""[Chun Xu](https://www.quora.com/profile/Chun-Xu-17)"" on Quorum who seems to be a bit more coherent than his reddit counterpart, but is especially fond of answering questions vaguely related to atoms, microscopy, or other subjects and shoehorning in links to his fake videos, images, and animations. From here we can get a little bit more information on how this microscope allegedly works:

* [It works using coherent scattering](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-microscopic-technological-developments-underway-to-view-atoms-in-live-time-more-clearly-and-in-greater-depths-or-have-we-reached-a-permanent-threshold-in-optics-on-a-microscopic-level/answer/Chun-Xu-17)
* sometimes it is ""[untransmitted](https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-atoms-visible-to-the-naked-eye/answer/Chun-Xu-17)"" or ""[not transmitted aperture](https://www.quora.com/What-keeps-electrons-in-orbit-around-atomic-nuclei/answer/Chun-Xu-17)""
* Sometimes he uses it to image copper, sometimes aluminum, sometimes ""[paper molecules](https://vimeo.com/303644127)"" but either way the results look remarkably similar.

They have also used at least one more reddit account in the past named /u/waitfof, and these posts started as far back as [July 2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/underthemicroscope/comments/8z69yu/a_microscope_aperture_grating_microscope_is_used/). The older account was presumably banned for spam, or maybe for having a microscope that was just too good for this world.

----

R1: This ""Aperture grating microscope"" is completely made up. While the user does use real words for real effects (for example, [Bragg's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg%27s_law) does indeed describe how waves interact with a crystal lattice under certain conditions), these words are strung together into non-sensical non-explanations, and that's when the user isn't just completely ignoring comments asking for explanation of just what the heck they are looking at.

In all seriousness, I honestly wouldn't even have put in the effort to write all this except for the fact that [many](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemicalreactiongifs/comments/a8v3xq/the_aluminum_atoms_were_photographed_with_an/) [of](https://www.reddit.com/r/physicsgifs/comments/b2q106/the_aluminum_atoms_were_photographed_with_an/) [their](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicroPorn/comments/a8ztlf/the_aluminum_atoms_were_photographed_with_an/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaserCleaningPorn/comments/ax50gq/the_aluminum_atoms_were_photographed_with_an/) have gotten *hundreds* of upvotes. So whatever the goal of this spam campaign is, it seems to be working.

&gt;By definition a theory (if that is what evolution is) is a means whereby to interpret observations. Thus, evolution is a philosophical framework, a template—and a worldview, for some.

They then say: https://donotlink.it/o7Jb
&gt;A key point of the Grants’ article is that variation did not always arise by random mutation. In fact, most of the cases in their list involve reshuffling of existing genetic information by interbreeding, hybridization or horizontal gene transfer. This immediately takes #8-12 off the list. The challenge to Darwinism by hybridization was shown in our post last year, “Hybrids Weave Darwin’s Tree into a Web,” which mentions the Grants and the potentially devastating impacts of this “revolution” on their work.

Why is hybridization against evolution? That maked no sense.

They do it again saying that the biological concept of species is blured thus no Darwinism...

&gt;In the light of these findings, it seems presumptuous of Darwin to write about “The Origin of Species” when we can’t even say what a species is. But neither would it be correct to think that all plants and animals have fluid boundaries, able to morph endlessly like shape-shifters into anything else. Clearly, you look different from a mushroom. How, then, are we to interpret the living world?

&gt;Try information. Notice that both these examples of information sharing are non-Darwinian. They don’t involve accidental mutations and blind natural selection. They are both methods whereby an organism’s genetic information can be given and received. We might consider the way people share good books with one another. That information might cause “change through time” in the way people behave based on what they come to know, but it would not be a blind, unguided process.

&gt;The theory of evolution by natural selection can be easily and completely falsified if geneticists are unable to find the GENETIC missing links that, by the very definition of the theory, MUST be there within the 450 years that DNA remains sufficiently viable to map the entire genome.

&gt;That's enough time to establish an average of 495 base pairs that are a) no longer part of the current human gene pool and b) are shared with the Chimp Human Last Common Ancestor. Moreover, the same holds true of modern chimpanzees, assuming that 450-year old chimpanzee DNA can be located.

&gt;Essentially, what I've done is to observe that evolutionists are now facing the very same problem of the various missing links with genetics that they previously faced with the fossil record, only now they can no longer appeal to the difficulty of finding those fossils. 

Sever things...
First off, DNA is viable for much longer than 450 years.

DNA can last to over 800,000 years.

&gt;And even that retreat fails to account for the fact that we should be seeing more and faster fixated mutations among the human race further separating us from the CHLCA because a) beneficial mutations fixate faster among growing populations and b) the environmental changes have been greater over the last 450 years than at any time previous, including catastrophes and Ice Ages.

 Most people have 1 or 2 kids. You have 2 parents. You need 2 kids for it to replace the adults and that's if those two kids reproduce themselves. You need 3 for it to be above replacement fertility for that family. Naturally many dont reproduce or due to women pushing it off till there late 20s to early 30s where the chance of pregnancy decreases every year after 30, they're lucky if they get 1. So no. We are not at replacement level on our own with this gynocentric culture and system.   
Due to welfare and the fact 60% of tax revenue goes to it, and you need more people paying in than taking out, you need a lot of workers to tax, a large demographic takes welfare and even greater if you count departments funded by it, meaning you need a-lot of workers. We dont have enough net tax payers go fund it on our own due to having 1 or 2 kids perfamily, which is why the left wants to bring in migrants to fund it, problem is alot of them get on welfare too and after a generation or two at most the same problem as the first paragraph occurs.

 [u/MajorMeerkats succinctly explains the sources of plastic waste in the world's oceans](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/aimjfn/umajormeerkats_succinctly_explains_the_sources_of/)  


I've debunked this many times, as you can [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/comments/adcv18/incredibly_rare_baby_albino_sea_turtle/edgzems), and I'm getting tired of it, so I wanted to do this once and for all.

 

First thing's first, this is the paper where the 90% claim stems from[\[1\]](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.7b02368):

&gt;Schmidt, C., Krauth, T., &amp; Wagner, S. (2017). **Export of Plastic Debris** ***by Rivers*** **into the Sea**. Environmental Science &amp; Technology, acs.est.7b02368. [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b02368](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b02368)

Now, if you read the title of the paper carefully, you'll have your first clue as to why the claim doesn't hold water. Rivers are *one* land source of plastics, but certainly not the *only* land source, nor the largest.

**The abstract:**

&gt;A substantial fraction of marine plastic debris originates from land-based sources and rivers potentially act as a major transport pathway for all sizes of plastic debris. We analyzed a global compilation of data on plastic debris in the water column across a wide range of river sizes. Plastic debris loads, both microplastic (particles &lt;5 mm) and macroplastic (particles &gt;5 mm) are positively related to the mismanaged plastic waste (MMPW) generated in the river catchments. This relationship is nonlinear where large rivers with  population-rich catchments delivering a disproportionately higher fraction of MMPW into the sea. **The 10 top-ranked rivers transport 88–95% of the global load into the sea**. Using MMPW as a predictor we calculate the global plastic debris inputs form rivers into the sea to range between **0.41 and 4 × 10****^(6)** **t/y**. Due to the limited amount of data high uncertainties were expected and ultimately confirmed. The empirical analysis to quantify plastic loads in rivers can be extended easily by additional potential predictors other than MMPW, for example, hydrological conditions.

As we can see in the abstract above, the 90% claim stems directly from the paper, IF one forgets to keep in mind that the paper only assessed plastics from rivers.  What the paper actually says is that of those 0.47 million tons to 2.75 million tons per year (the global annual river load into the sea), ""the 10 top-ranked rivers transport 88−95%"", not of the overall amount coming from land, let alone including maritime sources. We'll get to how significant this difference is in a bit.

Let's assume that the claim was true that 90% of plastic in the ocean comes from 10 rivers in Asia and Africa. First, for clarity, are we talking about 90% of plastics entering the ocean annually at the moment, or 90% of the total amount of plastic already in the ocean? Many headlines do not make a clear distinction, but there is an important difference. It's important because the current release might not reflect how the total amount got there in the past, when waste management practises in the West were much worse. This is comparable to how China is currently the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gasses, but USA and other western countries held this title for a long time before then, emitting most historical emissions. Remember, that old plastic is still around.

For simplicity's sake, let's focus on the annual land-based plastic release, because no one has a clear estimate of the total amount of plastic in the ocean. Land sources are estimated to account for 80% of plastics entering the ocean, whilst the remainder comes from maritime sources. This in itself excludes the possibility of 10 rivers exporting 90% of plastics entering the ocean, if one were to account for maritime sources as well, because - again - ""only"" 80% of plastics entering the ocean come from land.[\[2\]](http://www.eunomia.co.uk/reports-tools/plastics-in-the-marine-environment/)

Now, if it were true that these rivers release 90% of land-based plastic, then if we look at estimates for the total annual release of land-based plastics, the figure for the amount of plastic coming from these 10 rivers would be 90% of that figure - right? Let's see.

Okay, we will use the most widely cited paper for the total land-based release of plastics[\[3\]](http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84954204572&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=28a97ef4a4fdee6db9ef2fe507a1a02a):  
Jambeck, J. R., Geyer, R., Wilcox, C., Siegler, T. R., Perryman, M., Andrady, A., … Lavender, K. (2015). **Plastic waste inputs from land into the ocean**. Science (Vol. 347). [https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107415386.010](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107415386.010)

Bearing in mind that this 2015 analysis was based on 2010 data, let's have a look at the numbers. So, according to Jambeck et al., between with 4.8 to 12.7 million tons of plastic are entering the ocean every year from land-based sources, so that's 4.8 × 10^(6) and 12.7 × 10^(6) tons/year. Okay, so how much plastic did ***Schmidt et al. 2017*** estimate that rivers release into the ocean every year globally? In the abstract above, they report a range of ***0.41 to 4 million tons*** **annually**, but wait - there's a catch! Schmidt et al. issued [this correction](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.7b06377), which almost no one took note of:

&gt;The numbers on the global plastic debris input from rivers provided in the abstract are incorrect. The correct version with the numbers from the Results section is: Using MMPW as a predictor we calculate the global plastic debris inputs form rivers into the sea to range between **0.47 × 10****^(6)** **and 2.75 × 10****^(6)** **t/y**.

​So they lowered the upper end of their range as reported in the abstract from 4 million tons to 2.75 million tons.

&amp;#x200B;

For illustration, let's put the total land-based release and the river based release side by side:

**Total annual land export of plastics into the ocean (*****Jambeck et al. 2015*****):**

*4.8 to 12.7 million tons*

**Total annual river export of plastics into the ocean (*****Schmidt et al. 2017*****):**

*0.41 to 2.75 million tons*

Before we do the percentage calculation, does anyone wanna do some napkin math or take a wild guess if the lower (Schmidt et al.) number can ever be 90% of the upper (Jambeck et al.)? &gt;!The answer is no.!&lt;

Even if we compare the lower end of the former number and the upper end of the latter (which is a dubious thing to do), it gives no more than **57.3%**. The middle of the 4.8 to 12.7 million tons / year, namely 8 million tons, is more commonly cited and used. Using this value, all rivers contribute between **5 and 34.4%** of the total annual land-based input of plastics into the ocean, and 88-95% of this comes from 10 rivers. That means that the overall percentage of land-based plastics coming from these 10 rivers is somewhere between **4.5 and 31%**. Possibly a substantial amount, but *nowhere near the claimed 90%*. It's worth noting that the authors of the river export paper emphasise the large uncertainty of their estimate in the abstract, as is evident from the fact that their upper estimate is 7 times higher than the lower estimate. 

Just to drive the point home, let's look at the issue another way. 2.75 million tons is the upper end estimate for plastic entering the ocean each year through rivers. If this was 90% of the total input, what would the total be? Well, we would need to add 10% to get from 90% to 100%, right? Let's do that.

Total (plastic\_input) \* 0.9 = 2.75 \* 10^(6) tons

Total (plastic\_input) = (2.75\* 10^(6) tons) / 0.9 = 3.06 \* 10^(6) tons or 3.06 million tons per year.

Voila! Now the issue of plastic pollution is 60% smaller than reported by virtually everyone (see links below).

Since this conclusion is so far off, it's evident that the premise that rivers (which export a maximum of 2.75 million tons of plastic into the sea per year) are ""responsible for around 90 percent of the global input of plastic into the sea"" is wrong.

# I hope you will help me share this information, both in the linked thread and elsewhere, because this myth just won't die, despite my sustained efforts to kill it. It keeps popping up every time plastic pollution is discussed, polluting the debate. 

If you want to read more, National Geographic and [MarineLitter.no](https://marinelitter.no/) have also debunked this myth:

I am familiar with, for example, the misuse of the term “heritability” among the advocates of hereditarianism/scientific racism, as well as the methodological problems with using adoption studies to determine the genetic basis for between-group differences (among many bad arguments).


What do you make of some of the arguments in [this video ](https://youtu.be/Z9yskAcICx4) from Youtuber Ryan Faulk AKA “The Alternative Hypothesis”? Faulk seems to be a sort of “final boss” of “race realism”, because he has put out a high volume of videos relative to any serious attempts to debunk his hereditarian stance. Many debunking attempts have been mounted by Youtube skeptics, who aren’t exactly the best advocates for scientifically sound positions, and make anti-hereditarians look bad.


Some of the more noteworthy claims made in the video:
“Researchers have shown that genes involved in the brain differ most between the races”

“Human adaptive evolution has immensely increased in the past 5,000 years”

“Traits such as a propensity to delayed gratification and long-term planning are adaptive traits associated with Europeans, due to the harsh winters endured on the majority of the continent.”

“England’s ‘war on murder’ wherein criminals were sent to death en-masse had a noteworthy eugenic effect.”


A follow up question is this: Does Faulk vastly overestimate how easy it is for certain traits like low time preference to become genetically ingrained within a given population? Again, I am moderately well-read on the subject, but not to the degree to which I am familiar with every claim made by hereditarians.

&amp;#x200B;

Abstract

### Background

Dietary acid charge enhances bone loss. Bicarbonate or alkali diet decreases bone resorption in humans. We compared the effect of an alkaline mineral water, rich in bicarbonate, with that of an acid one, rich in calcium only, on bone markers, in young women with a normal calcium intake.

### Methods

This study compared water A (per litre: 520 mg Ca, 291 mg HCO3−, 1160 mg SO4−, Potential Renal Acid load (PRAL) + 9.2 mEq) with water B (per litre: 547 mg Ca, 2172 mg HCO3−, 9 mg SO4−, PRAL − 11.2 mEq). 30 female dieticians aged 26.3 yrs (SD 7.3) were randomized into two groups, followed an identical weighed, balanced diet (965 mg Ca) and drank 1.5 l/d of the assigned water. Changes in blood and urine electrolytes, C-telopeptides (CTX), urinary pH and bicarbonate, and serum PTH were measured after 2 and 4 weeks.

### Results

The two groups were not different at baseline, and showed a similar increase in urinary calcium excrection. Urinary pH and bicarbonate excretion increased with water B, but not with water A. PTH (*p* = 0.022) and S-CTX (*p* = 0.023) decreased with water B but not with water A.

### Conclusion

In calcium sufficiency, the acid calcium-rich water had no effect on bone resorption, while the alkaline water rich in bicarbonate led to a significant decrease of PTH and of S-CTX.

&gt;Now, look at this wording: “the first SUGGESTION that… MIGHT’VE BEEN PRODUCED” is not at all equivalent to the “testable prediction” he cites as proof, which was that “the common ancestor had 48 chromosomes (24 pairs) and humans carry a fused chromosome; or ancestor had 23 pairs and apes carry a split chromosome.”

&gt;Later, when he talks about the “original speculative hypothesis” he explains that it “predicted that telomeric signatures would be identified.” However, this is still not the “testable prediction” that was claimed after the fact. It’s entirely possible that the “testable prediction” was made prior to the tests, but we still haven’t seen proof of it.

Let’s see: http://monkeytrials.blogspot.com/2007/08/vox-dei-bate-10-no-back-testing-here.html

And:
&gt;Prometaphasic chromosomes of man and chimpanzee are compared, using R, Q, T and H-bands techniques. — Six pericentric inversions, one telomeric fusion-translocation, 4 intercalar deletions or insertions, 16 deletions or additions of terminal Q-bands, and an important variation of heterochromatin distinguish the 2 species. — The evolutive role of chromosomal rearrangements separating the 2 species is discussed with particular reference to the formation of human chromosome No 2.- The simultaneous analysis of human chromosomal pathology and of the chromosomal structures in primates should contribute to the understanding of accidental modifications of the genome and to the interpretation of their consequences.

How is this not a testiable prediction?

&gt;Until evolutionists stop collecting data and then making post-facto “predictions” that magically happen to fit the data they just collected, I see no reason to take them seriously or pay their models any attention at all, let alone “believe” in their conclusions.

science has already shown that people can identify intelligence traits in male faces, much more than they can identify correlated intelligence traits in female faces

this shitty, probably gov funded study

&gt; As male faces increased in masculinity, so did their perceived competence. For female faces, this relationship only held up to a point, after which more masculine female faces were actually perceived as less competent.

this is exactly what you'd expect, this is a bias that isn't gender based - the bias in within genders. male and female faces are seen differently - you want to write up that research? ""breaking news, scientists discover masculine and feminine faces, tomorrow night, is water wet tho? is it?""

so what they've found is a bias in men for masculinity, and isn't that a natural trait? manlier men are more competent? hello? when did the reptilian brain grow a brain? around the time we were thinking new ways to skin a cat

the more masculine you were, the more likely you were to skin a cat

&gt; these gender biases pose a threat to social justice, creating unfair environments for everyone.

Intrigued by what exactly has caused this reaction, I clicked on the link.

Okay I can't keep up the narrative style. Here's a list of what they got wrong:

1.  
&gt;What is the universe made of? Why are we here?
&gt;
&gt;One popular theory that addresses both of these questions is called quantum mechanics.

No it doesn't. Quantum mechanics addresses neither of those questions. It's a description of small things.

2.  
&gt;It insists the universe operates on a basis of uncertainty that relies on observation and measurement to determine reality.

It doesn't ""determine reality"". It constrains what we observe probabilistically.

3.  
&gt;It then follows that, if the universe is made up of those phenomena that are uncertain, and those that can measure them, humans would fall neatly into the latter category.

A big if that isn't true. An interaction is a measurement.

4.  
&gt;If quantum mechanics turns out to be correct this could be interpreted to mean our purpose in the universe is simply to behold the beauty around us, so it can become reality.

QM is true, but the second half is a non sequitur. I mean, how the fuck does one even come up with that?

5.  
&gt;In this version of the universe, if you were to shine a single photon of light into someone’s eye, they wouldn’t necessarily see it, but they’d “sense it.”

6.  
&gt;Alipasha Vaziri, a physicist at the Rockefeller University in New York City who both conducted and participated in experiments involving doing just that, told Nature:

There's a [link to an article from *2 years ago*](https://www.nature.com/news/people-can-sense-single-photons-1.20282) in that sentence, and you'd be better off reading it because it's from Nature and Nature's news team is pretty decent and actually know what they're doing.

7.  
&gt;If we start seeing the collapse of quantum waves happening all around us, it could take up too much bandwidth in our consciousness.

I... What?

8.  
&gt;So, weird as it sounds, for quantum mechanics theory to work it needs to happen in the background (like source code).

WHAT?

9.  
&gt;In another version of the universe, the observer effect is a mere side-effect of reality and quantum mechanics doesn’t have all the answers. Basically, if quantum theory is wrong, then it doesn’t matter whether observation or measurement occurs: what will be, will be.

Have you ever heard the term fractal wrongness? Because this article is turning out to be fractally wrong.

10.  
&gt;Here, if you were to shine a single photon in Vaziri’s eye again he’d sense it the same way. But if you entangled a photon and then beamed it onto his eye he’d perceive … something different. This would be potentially catastrophic for quantum mechanics.

It isn't possible for him to see something different. He will detect something in one eye or the other. Nor would it be catastrophic for QM. See below.

11.  
&gt;Paul Kwiat, a physicist at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign conducting similar experiments to Vaziri’s team, told Scientific American:

Read the [linked article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-human-eye-could-help-test-quantum-mechanics/) instead. It basically says that the purpose of the experiment is to test whether spontaneous collapse interpretations of quantum mechanics are correct,

12.  
&gt;It’s worth keeping in mind that there are numerous alternative theories to quantum mechanics.

Copenhagenism ≠ quantum mechanics, even though it is pretty much taught that way in undergraduate classes. This article seems to mistake the Copenhagen interpretation (if it even is one) for quantum mechanics, and is therefore misleading.

13.  
&gt;And, furthermore, that not being able to detect entanglement with the naked human eye doesn’t actually indicate that quantum mechanics is correct. But, as evidence continues to pile up for it, quantum mechanics remains the pervasive working theory to explain how our universe works.

Quantum mechanics is correct. The Copenhagen interpretation may not be.

14.  
&gt;So if you start seeing glitches in the matrix: you’re either seeing potential proof that quantum mechanics is wrong or you’re not in base reality – both classic Keanu or DiCaprio scenarios — either way, you should probably seek help.

1. The Planck length is the smallest possible length. (The Planck length is actually the length scale for which the energy required to probe it will create a black hole.)
2. There is a smallest possible length. (Loop quantum gravity proposes this, but is hardly something universally accepted among physicists.)
3. Black holes are irrelevant to the conversation. (As shown in (1), no, although an alternative way of obtaining Planck lengths would be setting c = ħ = G = 1 and finding a distance of 1, or the square root of the change in area of a black hole's event horizon when 1 bit of information is added.)

I've tried to find the actual scientific  study, have been sent down a rabbit-hole of bad science and shadiness,  with no study to be found!

========

Backstory:  A person on YouTube stated that a Dr Thuc ""Tim"" Le and Dr Jeffery  Talbot from Roseman University did a two-year study of the long-term  effects on the benefits of doTerra oils, unbeknownst to the company. I  tried to find it, and mistakenly thought she was talking about another  study done on the kidney cells of dogs which was easily refuted. This  one, if you're curious:

[https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/on-guard-doterra-essential-oils-and-a-lesson-in-reading-research-studies/](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/on-guard-doterra-essential-oils-and-a-lesson-in-reading-research-studies/)

That  was my bad, I should have looked into it further. It was one of the  first things that came up with my search parameters so I went with it.

The  woman correctly pointed out that it was the wrong study, and I've asked  her to cite the actual study then, so I can go over it. To get ahead of  her, I thought I'd look for it myself.

It. Doesn't. Exist.

As far as I can see, anyway.

The  problem: It's supposedly a study by Dr Thuc Le and Dr Jeffery Talbot of  Roseman University. Now, I've looked and found some shady shit. Like  this blog post from the university itself:

[http://www.roseman.edu/2018/10/03/roseman-university-researchers-study-doterra-essential-oils/](http://www.roseman.edu/2018/10/03/roseman-university-researchers-study-doterra-essential-oils/)

I  find it strange that a university would align itself with an MLM  company like this. I also find the following quote problematic:  **These  observations were presented to dōTERRA and the company  subsequently  awarded $128,000 in grant funding to advance Roseman  University’s  research of “The Oil Effect.”**

To  me, this shows a corporate interest in the outcome of the study (which I  can't find!). They are (as in doTerra) funding more studies themselves.  So either the study wasn't done prior to this grant (but the blog post  seems to say that there was research done), or that money was given to  complete the study. There had to have been a lot of science done because  it says they were looking into it for two years and they've made lofty  claims in the blog post.

I found Dr Thuc Le's Research Gate link:

[https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/2065856881\_Thuc\_T\_Le](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/2065856881_Thuc_T_Le)

There's nothing about their research.

Request:  Are there any people on here who are scientifically minded? Is there  any good reason for any of this? I'm not a scientist -- just a believer  in critical thinking! -- so what might seem fishy to me could be normal  in the realm of scientific research.

Let me first say that I think philosophy is a worthwhile field, but a few bad eggs is all it takes for some science popularizers to dismiss it as worthless.

Here's a [dualist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/#Int) argument from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:

&gt;Robins Collins (2011) has claimed that the appeal to conservation by opponents of interactionism is something of a red herring because conservation principles are not ubiquitous in physics. He argues that energy is not conserved in general relativity, in quantum theory, or in the universe taken as a whole. Why then, should we insist on it in mind-brain interaction?

First of all, ""conservation principles"" is the foundation of modern physics. To say conservation principles are not ubiquitous in physics is like saying life isn't ubiquitous in biology.

Second, energy is conserved in quantum mechanics, so that's just a glaring factual error.

Third, energy is conserved locally in general relativity.

Fourth, energy conservation exists when a system is time-translation symmetric, i.e. you can start the system a bit later and it continues acting the same way. This is why energy isn't conserved in the entire universe, since spacetime is expanding. The brain is not such a system.

&gt; • These genes are known to influence mainly the hippocampus, brain, limbic system, central nervous system, cerebral cortex, cerebrum, parahippocampal gyrus, telencephalon, temporal lobe, brain stem, prosencephalon, rhombencephalon, occipital lobe, cerebellum, visual cortex, parietal lobe, retina, basal ganglia, neural stem cells, corpus striatum and frontal lobe. 

&gt; • These genes alone account already for roughly two thirds of one standard deviation in cognitive ability. 

&gt; • These genes are at least 50% more likely to exist in one population than in the other, can be found in at least one third of either population, and positively affect Europeans or negatively affect Africans. More than 200 genes that meet these requirements can be conservatively estimated to exist. 

&gt; • The differences between populations might be even larger since the African sample included cohorts with European admixture.

&gt;Oops! We were wrong. Darwin did not get his idea from Haeckel. 

Huzzah! 

&gt;But there are two silver linings to our mistake, so let’s look at both of them.

Aw crap...

&gt;Modern scientists know that acquired characteristics are not inherited. Today, evolutionists are back to where they were before Darwin. They believe evolution happens, but they don’t know how. The best explanation they have is a collection of lucky mutations. 

Medelian genetics and genetic drift! Mutations are only the first step! 

&gt;Darwin’s stunning contribution was that he came up with a plausible (at the time) explanation of how evolution worked. He said that characteristics acquired by diet, exercise, and climate, were inherited by the offspring, and that natural selection preserved the most favorable characteristics because more offspring were produced than would survive long enough to reproduce.

Ironicly he was right...sort of. If he only knew about epigenetics. http://theconversation.com/no-epigenetics-and-environmental-responsiveness-dont-undermine-darwinian-evolution-65647

&gt;The second silver lining is that it shows how circular reasoning can reinforce wrong ideas. Darwin’s theory made Haeckel’s fake drawings more plausible. Haeckel’s fake drawings made Darwin’s theory more plausible.

Wrong.

&gt;The fact that the developmental order is the same (except when it is different ) is significant only in that it helps us to understand how the developmental process works. That is, it helps us understand which parts of the DNA instructions are executed first, and what causes the execution order. This is real science, which has absolutely nothing to do with creation or evolution.

&gt;An evolutionist would say that the developmental process is largely the same because all things evolved from a common ancestor. A creationist would say that the developmental process is largely the same because all things were designed by the same creator. It is circular logic in both cases.

And a straw man that Darwiniansts never made. God he even links to the article  which explains why this thinking is never used.

Vibration in quantum physics means that *everything is energy.* We are beings that vibrate at certain frequencies. Each vibration is equivalent to a feeling and in the ""vibrational"" world, there are only two types of vibrations, the positive and the negative. Any feeling causes you to emit a vibration that can be positive or negative.

*1st.- THE THOUGHTS*🤔
Every thought emits a frequency towards the Universe and that frequency returns towards the origin, then in the case, if you have negative thoughts, of discouragement, sadness, anger, fear, all of that turns towards you. That is why it is so important that you take care of the quality of your thoughts and learn to cultivate more positive thoughts.

*2nd - THE COMPANY We have..*👨‍👨‍👧‍👦👨‍👨‍👦‍👦
The people around you directly influence your vibrational frequency. If you surround yourself with happy, positive, determined people, you will also enter into that vibration, now if you surround yourself with complaining, cursing and pessimistic people, be careful! Well, they may be decreasing your frequency and as a consequence preventing you from making the Law of Attraction work in your favor.

*3rd - THE MUSIC*🎵🎶
The music is very powerful. If you only listen to music that speaks of death, betrayal, sadness, abandonment, all that will interfere in what you vibrate. Pay attention to the lyrics of the music you listen to, it may be decreasing your vibrational frequency. And remember: You draw into your life exactly what you vibrate.

*4th - THE THINGS YOU SEE*🧐😳
When you watch programs that deal with misfortune, death, betrayal, etc. your brain accepts that as a reality and releases a whole chemistry in your body, causing your vibrational frequency to be affected. See things that do you good and help you vibrate at a higher frequency.

*5th - THE ENVIRONMENT (Space..House and Workplace.)*🏬🏩🏠
Whether at home or at work, if you spend much of your time in a disorganized and dirty environment, this will also affect your vibrational frequency. Improve what is around you, organize and clean your environment. Show the Universe that you are apt to receive much more. Take care of what you already have.

*6th - THE WORD*🤫
If you tend to complain or speak badly about things and people, this affects your vibrational frequency. To maintain your high frequency it is essential that you eliminate the habit of complaining and speaking badly about others. Then avoid making dramas and victimize yourself. Take responsibility for the choices of your life.

*7 - THE GRATITUDE*🙏🏻🙏🏻
Gratitude positively affects your vibrational frequency. That is a habit that you should incorporate right now into your life. Start to thank for everything, for the good things and those that you consider not good, thanks for all the experiences that you have lived. Gratitude opens the doors for good things to flow positively in  your life.

&gt;Conceivably, some birds could have mammary glands or hair; some mammals could have feathers (they are an excellent means of insulation). Certain fish or amphibians could have differentiated or cusped teeth, but these are only characteristics of mammals.

&gt;These patterns are here because evolution predicts that a new trait will emerge from an existing trait. These traits will be cultivated by the environment as they will help organisms live long enough to reproduce and pass on those traits with modification.

&gt;A mix and match of characters would make it extremely difficult to objectively organize species into nested hierarchies. Unlike organisms, cars do have a mix and match of characters, and this is precisely why a nested hierarchy does not flow naturally from classification of cars. Indeed a designer wouldn't need to follow any patter because it wouldn't have the same limitation as evolution and thus wouldn't need to follow the same pattern.

&gt;Coyne denigrates the academic achievements of Dr. Gonzalez, noting that he was denied tenure at Iowa State University in 2008 (actually, it was 2007) and suggesting that the reason for this was not his advocacy of Intelligent Design (as Dr. Gonzalez had alleged), but “his lack of scholarship, students, and his poor funding” – a totally false allegation which has been thoroughly refuted in an Evolution News and Views post by John West, a Senior Fellow of the Discovery Institute, which shows that Dr. Gonzalez had published 68 refereed articles in science journals, that in 2006, the year he was up for tenure, Gonzalez published more total articles than all other tenured astronomers at Iowa State University, and that he managed to attract no less than $172,000 in outside grants while he was at ISU. Coyne’s information is therefore badly out-of-date. Indeed, as far back as December 2007, Evolution News and Views published an article by Casey Luskin, which quoted from a “smoking gun” document, showing that Dr. Gonzalez was denied fair tenure process by hostile colleagues who plotted behind his back, suppressed evidence, and then misled the public.

My feelings about the movement towards ""natural"" aside, the writer recommended a $60 cleansing oil, and included this following line:

&gt; [It's paraben-, preservative- and chemical-free, and smells divine.] (https://www.refinery29.com/2018/01/189611/natural-ethical-beauty-products-farm-to-face#slide-1) 

I am taking offense at the preservative-free claim. This is not only factually wrong, this is extremely dangerous.

Let me make this clear: the marketing copy for this product doesn't claim to be preservative-free. The copy brags about having AHA and plant extracts, but they don't claim to be [preservative-free] (https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/african-botanics-pure-marula-cleansing-oil.html). If the company did, they would have been wrong. 

This is the ingredient list: 

&gt;Glycerin, Capric/Caprylic Triglycerides, Aqua, Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Sorbitan Oleate, Sclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed Oil\*\*, Moringa Pterygosperma (Moringa) Seed Oil\*\*, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil\*\*, Isoamyl Laurate, Lauryl Glucoside, Coco Glucoside, Eriocephalus punctulatus (Chamomile Cape) Essential Oil, Citrus Paradisi (Pink Grapefruit) Essential Oil, Vaccinium Myrtillus (Bilberry) Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugar Cane) Extract, Acer Saccahrinum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Extract, Tocopherol Acetate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Benzoate\*, Citral\*, Citronellal\*, Geraniol\*, Limonene\*, Linalool\*. \*Constituents Of Natural Essential Oils Used. \*\*Certified Organic. 100% Vegan. Gluten-free.

Guess what? Both dehydroacetic acid and benzyl alcohol are used as preservatives. So the writer's claim about preservative-free is factually wrong.

Here's the bigger issue, though: cosmetic products need preservative systems. 

You cannot sell an unsafe product. Cosmetics are often a mixture of oils and water, which is perfect breeding ground for disease agents like mold and bacteria and viruses and fungi. This means that you cannot sell a product without an adequate preservative system. These germs need to be killed, or you will sicken someone, if not kill them. 

Even if you did your best to disinfect the manufacturing equipment, and even if all of the employees involved in manufacture practice safe manufactory practices, bacteria and mold can still get in. Plus, as a consumer uses the product, it will accumulate bacteria, fungi and mold over time. If these are allowed to grow unimpeded, this can change the color, scent, texture, etc of the product. Consumers like having a product that lasts as long as possible. As such, it is very important to have a system in place to preserve the product, not only to preserve human health, but to keep a product usable for as long as possible. 

Therefore, suggesting that a product 100% lacks preservatives, and implying that this is a good thing, is extremely irresponsible. By suggesting that having no system in place is more ethical, natural, or safe, you are endangering people's lives. Additionally, you are forcing your readers to spend more money on products than they need to, simply because preservative systems are necessary for it to last long enough for it to be used up. 

(I will note that there are products that claim to be self-preserving; these products don't use traditional preservatives, but they still have a system in place. Whether these are adequate is outside the scope of this post, but even the natural cosmetic lines agree that preserving products is a good thing.)",True,False,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,13026.0,public,self,"Refinery 29 article claims that a cosmetic product is preservative free, and implies that this is a good thing.",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/8wsaq6/refinery_29_article_claims_that_a_cosmetic/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,markdown,,,,,,,,,

Answer 2: Worms didn’t change into humans—we still have worms today. Rather, worms and humans have a common ancestor, if you go back far enough.

&gt;Actually, not only would it be easier to get to, but the paralax between the polar orbit of Jupiter and it's host moons would be sufficient enough to destabilize the cortex of the magnetic field. This would allow for future craft to establish a network between Earth and Jupiter within a timeframe of mere months.

Can you provide a consensus to the Lunar theory of asteroid tertiary models within the solar arc of Jupiter and its moons?

Kind of hard to know where to start:

&gt;Actually, not only would it be easier to get to, but the paralax

spelling, also parallax doesn't make sense in this context because it's the observed shift when you view something from two different points, not an object or physical distance, like they appear to be using the word

&gt;between the polar orbit of Jupiter

Do they mean the orbit of Jupiter is polar or a polar orbit around jupiter

&gt;and it's 

its

&gt;host moons 

Host isn't really used in this way, but if it was it would be Jupiter who is the host, not the moons

&gt;would be sufficient enough to destabilize the cortex of the magnetic field.

Err...cortex is a word for an outer layer, normally of a biological organ.  Eg, the cortex of your brain, the cortex of the kidney, even the cortex surrounding a plant root.  Magnetic fields don't have cortexes

&gt;This would allow for future craft to establish a network between Earth and Jupiter within a timeframe of mere months.

A network of what?

&gt;I remember an old professor of mines 

Probably shouldn't have gotten astronomical explanations from a mining engineer :P

&gt;explain how if a singularity

this thing's an asteroid not a singularity

&gt;within close proximity to the Hulls Field

[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCOM_Stadium) is the only Hull's Field I can find reference to

&gt;would infer a route between asteroids and neighboring exoplanets,

um...

&gt;giving us a clear line of sight for molecular telescopes

er..

&gt;and nuclear fueled craft. Can you provide a consensus to the Lunar theory

A theory predicting the movements of the moon?

Finally, some good old fashioned astrology  https://alabe.com/solararc.html

Don\'t think you can use a schedule someone else had success with, it doesn\'t work that way.\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll psychiatrist will say they have experience, so ask them to share recent successful cases. Most psychiatrist spend their day refilling Jr\'s Ritalin or switching soccer mom from Prozac to Zoloft, the occasional alcoholic gets referred to rehab.\n\n\n\n-\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nVast majority think all is well taper over 2-4 weeks and then quit. If you have been taking a benzo longer than 6 weeks any taper less than 6 weeks is too fast. If you have been taking a benzo over 6 months any taper less than 3 months is too fast. This is my opinion, and I stand by it. Unfortunately, the recovery community has had to educate themselves, b/c the majority of physicians just don\'t know. :(\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nEveryone is different. That\'s why there is no standard schedule and why you need an experienced psychiatrist to dial in what\'s right for you. There will be times your Dr will have to slow it down and that\'s typical. There is no quick and easy way, but with patience and a knowledgeable Dr. you can do it!\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n&gt; **Important**\n\n\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-\nThere is a difference between psychological and physical addiction. Opiods have a high physical and psychological addiction potential. Benzodiazepines have a moderate psychological dependence potential and a very high physical dependency (*highest*)..Drug seeking behavior is no where close to Opiods, but physical addiction is even worse than Opiods.\n\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nDiscontinuIng Opiods including Heroin is miserable but certainly physically possible, not always true with Benzodiazepines. Rehabilitation often the opioid addicted were stable after 3-4 weeks, not happy but stable and some even returning to healthy activities before their addiction (sports, music etc.). Benzo folks not so. Sometimes 6 months before they are seen in the cafeteria.\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nCase in point, Cocaine has a very high propensity for psychological addiction and drug seeking behavior; however, a mild- moderate potential of physical addiction. For those who survive this addiction, withdrawal includes hypersomina and depression , but even abrupt discontinuation isn\'t dangerous or even requires a taper. Of course, psychological addiction can be just as dangerous, but re: physical addiction its a different, dangerous and deadly myth that benzos have a better safety profile than the aforementioned illegal drugs. They don\'t! \n\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n-\n\n\n\nIMO this is what makes Benzodiazepine addiction insidious. Vast majority addicted were never looking for a high, but were advised into a situation they never wanted.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n**Understanding BZ w/d, and beginning the road back**\n\n\n\n-\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Badpill/comments/7jyn6l/suggestion_for_bz_taper/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=Badpill\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benzodiazepines may be the most egregious case of big pharm pressuring the FDA to sit on their hands and refrain from imposing restrictions or warning labeling.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benzodiazepines are one of the fastest growing drug classes and 3 of them are in the top 10 most prescribed drugs in the US, a market worth multiple billions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worse than Heroin Withdrawal?

As far as withdrawl syndrome symptoms go both are  horrible, but the patients I have spoken with said they would choose opioid withdrawal over benzodiazepine withdrawal everyday day of the week and twice on Sunday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many of these heartbreaking accounts from patients go something like this..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you are a soccer mom and you are stressed out big time because your husband may get laid off from work.

Don&amp;#39;t think you can use a schedule someone else had success with, it doesn&amp;#39;t work that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All psychiatrist will say they have experience, so ask them to share recent successful cases. Most psychiatrist spend their day refilling Jr&amp;#39;s Ritalin or switching soccer mom from Prozac to Zoloft, the occasional alcoholic gets referred to rehab.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vast majority think all is well taper over 2-4 weeks and then quit. If you have been taking a benzo longer than 6 weeks any taper less than 6 weeks is too fast. If you have been taking a benzo over 6 months any taper less than 3 months is too fast. This is my opinion, and I stand by it. Unfortunately, the recovery community has had to educate themselves, b/c the majority of physicians just don&amp;#39;t know. :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone is different. That&amp;#39;s why there is no standard schedule and why you need an experienced psychiatrist to dial in what&amp;#39;s right for you. There will be times your Dr will have to slow it down and that&amp;#39;s typical. There is no quick and easy way, but with patience and a knowledgeable Dr. you can do it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between psychological and physical addiction. Opiods have a high physical and psychological addiction potential. Benzodiazepines have a moderate psychological dependence potential and a very high physical dependency (&lt;em&gt;highest&lt;/em&gt;)..Drug seeking behavior is no where close to Opiods, but physical addiction is even worse than Opiods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DiscontinuIng Opiods including Heroin is miserable but certainly physically possible, not always true with Benzodiazepines. Rehabilitation often the opioid addicted were stable after 3-4 weeks, not happy but stable and some even returning to healthy activities before their addiction (sports, music etc.). Benzo folks not so. Sometimes 6 months before they are seen in the cafeteria.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Case in point, Cocaine has a very high propensity for psychological addiction and drug seeking behavior; however, a mild- moderate potential of physical addiction. For those who survive this addiction, withdrawal includes hypersomina and depression , but even abrupt discontinuation isn&amp;#39;t dangerous or even requires a taper. Of course, psychological addiction can be just as dangerous, but re: physical addiction its a different, dangerous and deadly myth that benzos have a better safety profile than the aforementioned illegal drugs. They don&amp;#39;t! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IMO this is what makes Benzodiazepine addiction insidious. Vast majority addicted were never looking for a high, but were advised into a situation they never wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding BZ w/d, and beginning the road back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Badpill/comments/7jyn6l/suggestion_for_bz_taper/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=Badpill""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Badpill/comments/7jyn6l/suggestion_for_bz_taper/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=Badpill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'Badpill', 'subreddit_id': 't5_3ihiv', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/Badpill', 'subreddit_subscribers': 434, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'new', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'If you think Heroin withdrawal sounds like Hell, let me introduce you to Benzodiazepine withdrawal.', 'ups': 10, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Badpill/comments/6orvqm/if_you_think_heroin_withdrawal_sounds_like_hell/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': None}]",,,,,,,,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,markdown,,False,,,,,,,

The light in this star diminishes over weeks by as much as 21%.  What we know is that it's likely that something close to the star is blocking the stars light.  The size and length of the dimming events suggest that whatever is blocking the light is actually larger than the star itself.  Therefore, one scientist suggested that the findings are similar to what Dyson suggested a Dyson's sphere looked like and that was the sole basis for the media storm.  A number of papers have suggested it is not a planet crashing into the star which the media has also constantly suggested.  More recently, the media has done a 180 suggesting that it is not aliens but just dust.  The problem here is that what could be producing that much dust is a big mystery (but that part as far as I know has never been discussed in the media).  The new research indicates that the dust is very fine and cold (no infrared radiation has been associated with the dust which seems to rule out planet collisions a binary star system and other warm object ideas.  Furthermore, the dimming events last for several weeks and the fine dust would be blown out by the radiation pressure from the star in a matter of days.  Another even larger problem for the dust explanation is the star also has been slowly dimming in the long term.  Recent papers (not reported in the press) suggest for at least a century.  It is well documented that in the past 3 years, the star has dimmed by over 3% (Also not reported in the press since the dust stories started making the rounds).  Except for in December when it made a 1% recovery before then going back to the 3%.  That's very mysterious because as I already noted no one has come up with a hypothesis to explain how the dust gets replenished every few days.

In addition, the methods that test out these hypotheses can't say for sure that's fine cold dust.  Only that it's something transparent.

At this point, what the media should be saying is that it's a big unsolved mystery and the idea that it's cold dust or cold transparent material near the star appears to be the only thing about the phenomenon that we know for sure.",True,False,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,12369.0,public,self,"In Spite Of What The Media Has Reported About Tabby's Star, We Actually Know Next To Nothing About It.",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/86hzc9/in_spite_of_what_the_media_has_reported_about/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,markdown,,False,,,,,,,

A list of just a few of the problems with it, taken from a comment I made in another thread

1. Composition: The progression from OB stars down to planets makes no sense as a single chronological progression for an object. If you take a massive O-type star and make it undergo a ton of mass loss, you get the core leftover, which is heavily enriched with helium and (depending on lifecycle stage) other heavier elements. These heavy elements are not present in the quantities we'd expect in lower mass stars if those lower mass ones evolved from high mass stars. Also, how would such an enriched object turn into a Jovian planet with an overwhelmingly hydrogen-helium composition? Plus, the idea that carbon-rich white dwarfs grow into primordial-composition main sequence stars is insane unless you think there's a ton of carbon and oxygen fission happening in the core for some reason (which is also insane).

2. Conservation of Mass: White dwarfs don't have a way to gain enough mass in short order to create a blue supergiant, even if they manage to exceed the Eddington luminosity for an extended period of time. Also, there's just not a mechanism for that much mass loss from a planet. Even if Jupiter did magically lose the 99.6% of its mass required, the remainder wouldn't have the composition of a terrestrial planet like Earth, which is made mainly of iron, nickel, oxygen, carbon, silicon, etc., with very very little helium or hydrogen. 

3. Galaxy evolution: We don't see any galaxies composed mainly of planets (these would be identifiable from their far-IR luminosities and low radio activity, and according to his timescale should exist in our universe)

4. Physics: There's no math in any of his ""papers'. All physics papers have math in them. I doubt this guy could integrate 2sinxcosxdx if his life depended on it. He also doesn't mention a single physical law, principle, or equation in any of the papers I looked at, merely insists that every astronomer on the planet is stupid and he alone knows the truth.

5. Solar system formation: how would orbits remain stable if masses are changing so dramatically? Answer: they would not.

6. His timescales: he says ""dead moons"" (not sure what he means by that, but presumably he's including lifeless ones like Earth's) take ~65 billion years to form, which is almost five times the age of the universe. He says that ""Venus's"" take about 25 billion years. 

7. Supernovae and their remnants: How does he explain black holes? Supernovae? Neutron stars? If all the high-mass stars are just evolving down into lower-mass stars, what causes supernovae?

 I'll leave you with this actual quote from his blog:

&gt;**New paper of course. Lots of more work to do. I will crush the establishment. Just wait. Their days of Einstein pseudoscience are numbered.**

Plaisted, publicized [this article](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~plaisted/ce/dating2.html) on radiometric dating, with the next summary:

&gt; ""Most scientists today believe that life has existed on the earth for billions of years. This belief in long ages for the earth and the existence of life is derived largely from radiometric dating. These long time periods are computed by measuring the ratio of daughter to parent substance in a rock and inferring an age based on this ratio. This age is computed under the assumption that the parent substance (say, uranium) gradually decays to the daughter substance (say, lead), so the higher the ratio of lead to uranium, the older the rock must be. Of course, there are many problems with such dating methods, such as parent or daughter substances entering or leaving the rock, as well as daughter product being present at the beginning. Here I want to concentrate on another source of error, namely, processes that take place within magma chambers. To me it has been a real eye opener to see all the processes that are taking place and their potential influence on radiometric dating. 

&gt; Radiometric dating is largely done on rock that has formed from solidified lava. Lava (properly called magma before it erupts) fills large underground chambers called magma chambers. Most people are not aware of the many processes that take place in lava before it erupts and as it solidifies, processes that can have a tremendous influence on daughter to parent ratios. Such processes can cause the daughter product to be enriched relative to the parent, which would make the rock look older, or cause the parent to be enriched relative to the daughter, which would make the rock look younger. This calls the whole radiometric dating scheme into serious question. 

&gt; Geologists assert that older dates are found deeper down in the geologic column, which they take as evidence that radiometric dating is giving true ages, since it is apparent that rocks that are deeper must be older. But even if it is true that older radiometric dates are found lower down in the geologic column, which is open to question, this can potentially be explained by processes occurring in magma chambers which cause the lava erupting earlier to appear older than the lava erupting later. Lava erupting earlier would come from the top of the magma chamber, and lava erupting later would come from lower down. A number of processes could cause the parent substance to be depleted at the top of the magma chamber, or the daughter product to be enriched, both of which would cause the lava erupting earlier to appear very old according to radiometric dating, and lava erupting later to appear younger.

This is a gross distortion of how uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating works. As an example, let's take the mineral zircon which is often used when U-Pb dating. U-Pb dating is based on the relative abundances of uranium and one of its daughter isotopes, ^206Pb which is a radioactive isotope of lead. U-Pb dating measures the time elapse since the zircon crystal was formed by solidification of molten rock. That represents the age of it. Now we must be sure that in the solidified zircon there is no ^206Pb. Because to date the specimen validly, you ought to measure only the abundance of ^206Pb due to the radioactive decay *since* solidification of the zircon.

Now when solidifying, zircon crystals forming are expelling lead. Because zircon has a crystal structure that does not include lead. There may be small pockets of lead included in the rock matrix but these can ve avoided during dating by only extracting and purifying zircon crystals from any contamination.

Plaisted also neatly ""forgets"" to mention the enormous job done since the 1950s in detecting exactly the kind of problems he mentions that would cast doubts on the validity of radiometric dating. These efforts include, literally, thousands of experiments and research studies where endlessly all these factors are tested where and how they may cause such problems. The number of studies on what factor could change decay rates of the different, dozens of distinct isotopes alone counts into the hundreds.

He also ""forgets"" that a probate way to check out the validity of measurement techniques is calibration. In calibration for instance you apply different measurement techniques simultaneously on the same specimens. Here is an example of it including U-Pb dating applied on different specimens of the same geological layer (case: Hell Creek formation):

Name of the material | Radiometric method applied | Number of analyses | Result in millions of years
-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------
Sanidine | 40Ar/39Ar total fusion | 17 | 64.8±0.2
Biotite, Sanidine | K-Ar | 12 | 64.6±1.0
Biotite, Sanidine | Rb-Sr isochron | 1 | 63.7±0.6
Zircon | U-Pb concordia | 1 | 63.9±0.8

&gt;*Source: G. Brent Dalrymple ,“Radiometric Dating Does Work!” ,RNCSE 20 (3): 14-19, 2000.

Now the odds of different measurement techniques, each with their own clock and methodological principles, applied on the same specimen yielding concordant results is already virtually nil when only applying *two* different techniques, let alone when *four* - *especially* when, as creationists claim, one or several were invalid.

Applying several dating techniques often is standard procedure in geology, especially when the age of a rock is unsure.

Plaisted is a creationist as other quotes from this article tell:

&gt; Still, the creationist task is not finished by proposing all of these mechanisms for invalidating radiometric dating. 

Note that David A. Plaisted is a geologist nor physicist. This is no substitute though for proper representation of the methodological principles behind radiometric dating as Plaisted does in this terrible creationist exhibition of ignorance and cheating.

What we see here is a university which depicts itself as a serious scientific body, providing a platform for creationist pseudo-science and falsehoods by a person who doesn't even qualify as geologist or physicist.

EDIT: added comment why Plaisted is distorting.

I'm not going to say much about this. I honestly found Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel idea to be a pretty interesting one, if a little incomplete. There were numerous other factors why Europe ended up getting more stuff than other nations. One factor that I would point out is that Europe never had a major library destroyed throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance period, while the Middle East had its population and centers of learning nearly obliterated by the Mongol Invasion of the 13th century. Europe was spared this destruction, while some places like Persia lost 90% of their population and didn't fully recovery, population wise, until 1900 or so. The city of Baghdad was completely destroyed and all the libraries and learned men were killed there. The Ottoman's, while not completely anti-intellectual, had policies that slowed down scientific growth in the 16th century on, one of which was their refusal to adopt the printing press.

I looked through most of the article, and it's seems that they're just stating the Cold Climate theory like it is a gospel fact when it is just a hypothesis based on flawed data. Ditto for the final paragraph that restates the tired lie that the scientific community is all hi-jacked by some cabal of PC people who want to hear nothing but their own multicultural shit... I find it ironic that this is the case when these people are almost entirely funded by the Pioneer Fund that explicitly has a goal in mind... I don't need to elaborate further to you guys.

This totally ignores that the gender makeup of the Chicago comedy scene is still overwhelmingly male, and shows that exclusively book women are absent from the study. It's totally fine to book exclusively along gender lines if that's your thing, but it's disingenuous to not include such shows in stats that are specifically about gender disparity in lineups.  Additionally, the author decides who is and is not ""ready"", and comes to some conclusions that don't actually seem to be extrapolated from the data.

It's a rather unique and interesting subject to look at, but the 'study' is frustrated by bad or outright deceptive statistics in an effort to argue that roughly 20% of the stand-up community (as stand-up is changing, but it is still overwhelmingly male) should be getting 50% of the stage time.

The Alternative Hypothesis is a blog and growing YouTube channel that supports scientific racism (aka 'race realism'), Ryan Faulk is the man behind all of this. His ideas are rejected by most experts today and his sources are often pseudo-journals like [OpenPsych](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/OpenPsych_pseudojournals).

In this [article](http://thealternativehypothesis.org/index.php/2016/07/18/what-the-experts-really-think-about-race-realism-and-white-nationalism-or-at-least-ideas-pertaining-to-it/) and [video](https://youtu.be/nTYzq42nB38) Ryan Faulk tries to challenge the stigma against race realism by appealing to an apparent scientific consensus but in reality things aren't like what he tries to depict.

**Let's start...**
&gt;What we call the “left”, which I don’t know if it’s even appropriate to call them that anymore, has managed to pull off a great trick. And that trick is to convince people like me, and probably you, that the experts overwhelmingly disagree with race realism and white nationalism. That the relevant experts all know that biological races don’t exist, that the experts all know that races don’t differ in intelligence, and that diversity is great and mixed marriages are as good or better than same-race marriages.

Ryan doesn't like the left, diversity and race mixing.According to him leftists control the media and are responsible for tricking him and you with their fake news on race. 
&gt;Ann Morning looked at the usage of race in the 80 most commonly used high school biology textbooks from 1952-2002. While not as good as a survey of biologists, it gives us a rough indication of the trend in biology:
And so we see a steep decline in the use of race, reaching a low point in 1983-1992, but an increase from 1992-2002, including an enormous increase in medical descriptions.

Race is not a very useful factor in medical description either,  [here](http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/Duster/) a very good  article on the topic by Troy Duster for  Science, If you want to understand how race and medicine are related read that. 

&gt;In 2004 Leonard Lieberman reviewed several surveys of anthropologists in North America and Europe, and found that 31% of anthropologists in North America recognized race, while 43% in Europe recognized race. 

From the study:

*A second source of information in the
United States was a series of question-
naires mailed to members of the Ameri-
can Anthropological Association: (1) In
the first of these series4 a questionnaire
was mailed to college and university teac-
hers of physical anthropology in the Uni-
ted States. Among other questions, they
were asked to agree or disagree with the
statement that »Races do not exist be-
cause isolation of groups has been infre-
quent, populations have always inter-
bred.« Agreeing was 37 percent of 374
respondents. (2) In 1985 in the second of
the series, in response to the statement
»There are biological races in the species
Homo sapiens,« 41 percent (148) of res-
ponding physical anthropologists rejected
the race concept5. (3) In 1999, in response
to the same statement, 69 percent of res-
ponding physical anthropologists rejected
the concept6. The combined tally of res-
pondents in physical anthropology who
accepted race or were neutral was 31 per-
cent, a similar pattern to Cartmill’s7 stu-
dy of articles using race and published in
the American Journal of Physical Anthro-
pology for the year 1996.*

As the study says, there has been an increasing trend in the rejection of race by anthropologists during last decades. This is perfectly reasonable, genetic research has made huge breakthroughs in these years. Science is not static so opinions change, for that reason it's more useful reading recent surveys. Luckily we have [another survey of the American Anthropological Association](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.23120/full) conducted in November 2016, 5 months after Ryan Faulk published the article. Let's see what this survey has to say on the concept of race:

*1. The human population may be subdivided into biological races.  Strongly disagree or disagree (86%)   Agree or no response (14%)*

*2. Racial categories are determined by biology.  Strongly disagree or disagree (88%)  Agree or no response (12%)*

*13.  Genetic differences between racial groups explain most behavioral differences between individuals of different races.  Strongly disagree or disagree (95%) Agree or no response (5%)*.

*14. Most anthropologists believe that humans may be subdivided into biological races. Strongly disagree or disagree (85%) Agree or no response (15%)*

*17. The use of the term ‘race’ to describe human groups should be discontinued. Strongly agree or agree (71%) Disagree or no response (29%)*

&gt;In 2009 Katarzyna Kaszycka surveyed physical anthropologists in Eastern and Western Europe, and divided the results up by age group:
Kaszycka shows an important split between Western Europe and Eastern Europe. This is an important clue as to how, where and why race denial emerged.

This is an important clue as to the importance of linguistic differences. [This](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.2003.105.1.116/full) is a study made by the same authors, it explains well the problem with this kind of surveys:

*Unlike the U.S. anthropologists, Polish anthropologists tend to regard race as a term without taxonomic value, often as a substitute for population.The discrepancy may stem from differences in the traditions of anthropological schools, the differing sociopolitical histories, education, semantics, and possible attitudinal factors.*

**Black-White IQ Gap**

Before tackling this topic it's important to understand where the 'IQ by country' figures come from. Wikipedia has a [good page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence) on the topic:
 
&gt;In the 2002 book IQ and the Wealth of Nations, and IQ and Global Inequality in 2006, Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen created estimates of average IQs for 113 nations. They estimated IQs of 79 other nations based on neighboring nations or via other means. They saw a consistent correlation between national development and national IQ averages. They found the highest national IQs among Western and East Asian developed nations and the lowest national IQs in the world's least developed nations among the indigenous peoples in the regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America.[55] **In a meta-analysis of studies of IQ estimates in Sub-Saharan Africa, Wicherts, Dolan &amp; van der Maas (2009), p. 10 concluded that Lynn and Vanhanen had relied on unsystematic methodology by failing to publish their criteria for including or excluding studies. They found that Lynn and Vanhanen's exclusion of studies had depressed their IQ estimate for sub-Saharan Africa, and that including studies excluded in ""IQ and Global Inequality"" resulted in average IQ of 82 for sub-Saharan Africa, lower than the average in Western countries, but higher than Lynn and Vanhanen's estimate of 67. Wicherts at al. conclude that this difference is likely due to sub-Saharan Africa having limited access to modern advances in education, nutrition and health care.[56] A 2010 systematic review by the same research team, along with Jerry S. Carlson, found that compared to American norms, the average IQ of sub-Saharan Africans was about 80. The same review concluded that the Flynn effect had not yet taken hold in sub-Saharan Africa.[57]**
A 2007 meta-analysis by Rindermann found many of the same groupings and correlations found by Lynn and Vanhanen, with the lowest scores in sub-Saharan Africa, and a correlation of .60 between cognitive skill and GDP per capita.Hunt (2010, pp. 437–439) considers Rindermann's analysis to be much more reliable than Lynn and Vanhanen's. By measuring the relationship between educational data and social well-being over time, this study also performed a causal analysis, finding that when nations invest in education this leads to increased well-being later on.[58] Kamin (2006) has also criticized Lynn and Vanhanen's work on the IQs of sub-Saharan Africans.[59]
Wicherts, Borsboom &amp; Dolan (2010) argue that studies reporting support for evolutionary theories of intelligence based on national IQ data suffer from multiple fatal methodological flaws. For example, they state that such studies ""...assume that the Flynn Effect is either nonexistent or invariant with respect to different regions of the world, that there have been no migrations and climatic changes over the course of evolution, and that there have been no trends over the last century in indicators of reproductive strategies (e.g., declines in fertility and infant mortality)."" They also showed that a strong degree of confounding exists between national IQs and current national development status.[60]Similarly, Pesta &amp; Poznanski (2014) showed that the average temperature of a given U.S. state is strongly associated with that state's average IQ and other well-being variables, despite the fact that evolution has not had enough time to operate on non-Native American residents of the United States. They also noted that this association persisted even after controlling for race, and concluded that ""Evolution is therefore not necessary for temperature and IQ/well-being to co-vary meaningfully across geographic space

Most maps you can find online on global variation in IQ scores come from Lynn and Vanhanen's awful work. Sub-Saharan IQ is not 67 (  [interesting fact: average American IQ was actually 67 in the year 1900](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2012/12/13/opinion/kristof-its-a-smart-smart-smart-world.html?referer=https://www.google.it/)  ) but 80.

**...Let's go on**

&gt;For the survey in 2013 by Rindermann, Coyle &amp; Becker, they found that 42% of the 228 experts though that 0-40% of the black-white IQ gap was due to genes, 18% said that 50% of the gap was due to genes, and 39% said that 60-100% of the black-white IQ gap was due to genes. 

This survey was described in a [2013 blog post](http://drjamesthompson.blogspot.it/2013/12/genetics-genetic-groups-intelligence.html?m=1) about a conference presentation, the survey of psychologists described in that post has resulted in two [published](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804158/) [articles](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310315555_Survey_of_expert_opinion_on_intelligence_The_FLynn_effect_and_the_future_of_intelligence) , neither of which presents data on opinions regarding the black-white difference. The studies do, however, report that only about 20 percent of people who were invited to participate responded to any one set of items. One [survey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804158/) concerns cross-national differences, it is maybe the most controversial one given that it compares intelligence between every  'race' . According to this survey about 1/6 to 1/5 of cross-national differences can be attributed to genetics. We know that average sub-Saharan IQ is 80 and about 98 for Europeans,  this means that about 3 IQ points in differences are due to genetic reasons according to the interviewed psychologists.

&gt;Another thing I argue is that racial diversity is bad. And on this, there is no survey on people who research diversity that I know of. The most popular example of this is Robert Putnam’s paper “The Downside of Diversity” which showed that more racially diverse neighborhoods have less social engagement, are less likely to know their neighbors, and have less trust both of their neighbors and less trust of society in general.

Ryan Faulk is right here but he doesn't tell the entire story: 

*Ethnic diversity is increasing in most advanced countries, driven mostly by sharp increases in
immigration. In the long run immigration and diversity are likely to have important cultural,
economic, fiscal, and developmental benefits. In the short run, however, immigration and ethnic
diversity tend to reduce social solidarity and social capital.* [Putnam's paper] ( https://www.google.it/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.515.6374%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW2cOP677YAhUMuhQKHXKcA14QFgg9MAU&amp;usg=AOvVaw115uxV56VIlPe2tUtsc2nm)

Negative effects exist only in the short term for if I were Ryan I wouldn't argue these negative effects are intrinsically linked to skin color. 

&gt;being interracial is the second highest thing that increases the risk of a marriage in ending in divorce

Again, Ryan is right but he's not telling the whole story. Interracial marriage are in average more unstable but that's not always the case. Wikipedia has a [good page]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interracial_marriage_in_the_United_States) on the topic: 

*A 2008 study by Jenifer L. Bratter and Rosalind B. King conducted on behalf of the Education Resources Information Centerexamined whether crossing racial boundaries increased the risk of divorce.[8] Using the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (Cycle VI), the likelihood of divorce for interracial couples to that of same-race couples was compared. Comparisons across marriage cohorts revealed that, overall, interracial couples have higher rates of divorce, particularly for those that married during the late 1980s.[8] The authors found that gender plays a significant role in interracial divorce dynamics: According to the adjusted models predicting divorce as of the 10th year of marriage, interracial marriages that are the most vulnerable involve White females and non-White males relative to White/White couples.[8] White wife/Black husband marriages are twice as likely to divorce by the 10th year of marriage compared to White/White couples, while White wife/Asian husband marriages are 59% more likely to end in divorce compared to White/White unions.[8] Conversely, White men/non-White women couples show either very little or no differences in divorce rates.[8]Asian wife/White husband marriages show only 4% greater likelihood of divorce by the 10th year of marriage than White/White couples.[8] In the case of Black wife/White husband marriages, divorce by the 10th year of marriage is 44% less likely than among White/White unions.[8] Intermarriages that did not cross a racial barrier, which was the case for White/Hispanic White couples, showed statistically similar likelihoods of divorcing as White/White marriages.[8]
However, a 2009 study a year later by Yaunting Zhang and Jennifer Van Hook on behalf of Journal of Marriage and Family using a larger sample size than the previous study produced different results with Asian female/White male marriages shown as the least likely to divorce of any marriage pairing.[9]*

This is an evaluation of the factual inconsistencies I found in the video based on those notes. This list isn't complete and your input is more than welcome. My objective here isn't to be completely partisan and ""take down JF, hehehe"" but more to identify some issues I have with the video regarding its phrasing, inaccuracy, and apparent agenda. It seems to me to be a video which deliberately ""simplifies"" and obfuscates science to justify a person's belief in not only the pseudoscience of racialism but also in the ethics of the establishment of an ethnostate. 

0:43 ""Including but not limited to""

This is terminology that I've never seen used for good. Particularly when it's followed by examples of the most superficial and apparent variance between genetic groups. Examples of this language? How about the side effects section of pharmaceutical drug advertisements? Intentionally vague legal code? Nothing starting with ""including but not limited"" ever ends well. If none of the implications of your statement are contentious, you'd just list them.

:50 RE: Classifying subspecies and that stupid ball pit analogy

  There are many species in biology which do not have clear subdivision. In these cases their variation is considered cline. This means the variation exists on an infinite gradient, with no clear boundaries or subdivision. The implication of this seemingly semantic argument is severe, if we cannot except variant on a clear boundary then our use of ""subdivision"" in the rest of this video is false. Humans, are an example of a species with cline. 

""Furthermore, because human genetic variation is clinal, many individuals affiliate with two or more continental groups""
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1275602/

1:32 RE: distinct geographic separations of populations.

This is simply counter to consensus in the scientific community. I could spend all day on it but fortunately I don't have to, there are statements from scientific organizations to cover this. For example;
""Physical variations in any given trait tend to occur gradually rather than abruptly over geographic areas."" - AAA statement on race. 

1:55 RE: Cluster of distribution

The misrepresentation here is emblematic of the confusion that scientists want to avoid when they make statements such as the one from the Human Genome Project (""At the public announcement of the completion of a draft map of
the human genome (June 2000), Craig Venter, Head of Celera Genomics and
chief private scientist involved with the Human Genome Project, claimed that
‘race’ was not a scientifically valid construct."") I may be using the term confusion a bit too generously. I can't imagine that an evolutionary neuro-biologist life JF would make this statement out of pure ignorance, to me this is pure deception.

http://theracecardproject.com/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/1-45689d01ca5f907d5c16739859e5c15b/2013/10/McCann-race-human-genome.pdf

https://rosenberglab.stanford.edu/papers/popstruct.pdf

2:00 RE: clusters, again

I can't continuously make this point over and over, however this is the second time that JF has referenced clustering of genetic samples which, in reality are preassigned. The confirmation bias inherent in this methodology is glaringly obvious. Whether the outcome is a differentiation between the subgroups or not is irrelevant, the subgroups are ambiguous and inconsistent. There is little to no scientific value in a grouping which is not distinct.

2:09 RE: REAFFIRM OUR CONCLUSION  OF WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!!

This is literally a lie. There are no two ways around it. Science does not reach this conclusion. This is not accepted science. He is not speaking on behalf of science. This is a lie, a deliberate and well articulated misrepresentation of fact. This disregards statement from teh Human Genome Project, then American Association of Anthropologists, the American Association of Physical anthropologists, and evolutionary biologists (of which JF claims to be one. I am now doubting that claim.) Science, apart from some small schools of theoretical sociology or some shit, categorically rejects the notion of race and its application to pretty much all schools of study. This is just a lie. JF is lying here. 

One statement from one biologist who, unlike JF, isn't a disgraced failed academic.
""There are not enough genetic differences between groups of people to say that there are sub-lineages (races) of humans"" - Alan R. Templeton, Ph.D., professor of biology in Arts &amp; Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. 
https://source.wustl.edu/2003/05/evolutionary-biologist-race-in-humans-a-social-not-biological-concept/

2:24 RE: Heritability 

Again JF is citing scientific terminology in order to mislead the audience on race.
""But clarification of the concept of heritability shows that this reasoning is fallacious. Heritability is an uninteresting measure that only misleads us about race."" http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001002779500678R

Even heritability is not consistent among socioeconomic classes. Yes, I'm saying that poor people are less likely to pass down IQ results than wealthy (""The models suggest that in impoverished families, 60% of the variance in IQ is accounted for by the shared environment, and the contribution of genes is close to zero"" - http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.0956-7976.2003.psci_1475.x). Heritability is not a given, it is not  consistent, it is not guaranteed, nor in the case of the poor, is it likely. This is not evidence of consistent racial categories, it is not evidence of anything.

2:35 RE: Race Realism is not racist.

From the inception of the concept of race ity has only ever been used to do one thing. It is used to create an other which we then justify dehumanizing and attacking. There has never been a peaceful, non-racist instance of racial categorization. There has never been a peacefully attained ethnostate (there has never been a pure ethnostate for that matter) there has never been a peaceful attempt to secure an ethnostate. There has never been a society which treated all of its populations the same. There has never been a use of race which was not to prescribe to an individual traits which are not inherent to that person. It has always been used to say ""Black people are dumb"" or ""Asian people are good at math"" the assignment of characteristics to an individual based on an arbitrary categorization is racist. It is nothing other than racist. Whether you call it ""white supremacy"" or ""white separatism"" it is still the assignment of characteristic to an individual based on the category of race. This statement is a deflection of responsibility for the logical conclusion of these statements which will be, and is intended to be, racial prejudice. There  is no other purpose for the arbitrary categorization of a population which is scientifically arranged in cline.
""During World War II, the Nazis under Adolf Hitler enjoined the expanded ideology of ""race"" and ""racial"" differences and took them to a logical end: the extermination of 11 million people of ""inferior races"" (e.g., Jews, Gypsies, Africans, homosexuals, and so forth) and other unspeakable brutalities of the Holocaust."" - The American Anthropological Association
http://www.virginia.edu/woodson/courses/aas102%20(spring%2001)/articles/aaa_race.html


3:13  RE: Recognized categories of races

Race isn't even considered useful in science. There is always a better way to categorize human variation, so the use of race is irrelevant. Not only is there always a better way, but there is no real reason to use race in the first place other than laziness. Perhaps if JF wasn't so lazy in his scholarship he'd not have failed so dramatically in academia that he had to leave the field. 
""I advocate for de-racializing biological variation simply because there is always a more precise and meaningful way to characterize and explain those myriad variations.""
""In summary, there is no good scientific reason beyond word length, convenience, and maintenance of the status quo (laziness in short), to continue to racialize human variation.""
http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/Goodman/

3:25 RE: Arbirarily high numbers of races.

This is true. There can be arbitrarily high numbers. But more than the 600 he suggests. It's an infinitely high number. Because humans exist on a gradient of variation, and thus there are infinite subcategories. Infinitely many. This is why race is not useful nor accepted ion science. 

4:07 RE: inherited characteristics esp. IQ

What? He thought he was going to slip IQ in there and I wouldn't hear that? Statements regarding the heritability of IQ are false. Reference to passing down IQ from parents to child are useless. This is not true. It's not even close to true.

""estimates of the ‘heritability of IQ’ are not merely unreliable but meaningless.""
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010027772900224

""the earlier view that some genes are able to independently cause or contribute to developmental outcomes is effectively indefensible."" 
https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/96534

""the similarity... can be quantitatively accounted for by highly correlated placement (...) with little or no genetical component.""
https://www.nature.com/articles/248084a0

""Published analyses of IQ data provide no support whatever for Jensen's thesis that inequalities in cognitive performance are due largely to genetic differences.""
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4815127

4:18 RE: Parenting

OK, I'll take parenting as having an impact. This is difference in developmental environment is known to have an impact on children. This is the only scientifically accepted claim he's made to this point in the video.

4:49 RE: moral Judgements

As stated above the only ever use of racialism is in order to justify making moral and qualitative evaluations of people based on the groupings. Specifically their logical conclusion has been noted to be the holocaust. I do not think that this is a gross exaggeration. It seems to me to ne inherent in the division of populations that there will be conflict among them. Racialism is nothing more than an exercise in tribalism and the redefining of people to justify tribal action. Whether JF intends to make those moral evaluations himself, I can't say. But groups like the Nazi party, the KKK, European American Front, White Lives Matter, Blood and Honour Social Club, Supreme White Alliance, Black Riders Liberation Party, New Black Panther Party, Camp LoneStar, United for a Sovereign America, American Defence League, Fortress of Faith, and Soldiers of Odin all use racialism to justify their agenda. There are also all registered Hate groups. To assert that this is not a racist notion is to reject is use by all of these groups and many, many more. This is not only irresponsible it's dangerous.

5:15 RE: Racialism Denial?

Denial of races is acceptance of the infinite variation of human genetics on a gradient known as cline. AKA science. you eediot.

5:30 Why are there sperm on the screen right now?

Conclusion; 

I cannot imagine a purpose for this video other than to push a particular narrative to the exclusion of scientific evidence to the contrary. The video is rife with misrepresentations, lies, and obfuscations. As indefensible as Racialism has been in the past, this video is a particularly poor example of the concept's application. Furthermore the presentation of this material in what the audience is expected to understand to be an educational video is, at least to me, disgusting. It does not surprise me that this video is found on a channel which has been known to post Nazi apologetic propaganda and ""Hitler was a good guy"" videos. I wish that I had sufficient an Audience available to me to justify the time it would take for me to  produce a response video, but I don't. Unfortunately economic realities have limited my ability in that regard, however if you do have an audience and are willing to refute these claims, please do not hesitate to contact me. I have no interests which I would grand priority over helping in any way that I can.

&gt;Recent studies conclude that men on average have higher intelligence than women by 3-5 IQ points

Complete bullshit. The few studies showing this are mostly by Richard Lynn and his ilk, which have been routinely criticized for being [methodologically unsound.](https://www.nature.com/articles/438031a) In one particularly memorable instance, the StdDev was so high in his first major meta-analysis that many undergraduates (he used college samples, which I will get to in a minute) would be mentally deficient. He is also notorious for excluding data on arbitrary grounds that does not fit his narrative, and is a notorious race-realist. As to why these authors used these small numbers of studies instead of the prevailing consensus of the psychology community that sex differences in intelligence were negligible to nonexistent, your guess is as good as mine.

In addition, studies that use college students as their samples are [not an accurate look at populations.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188691100002X) More men are high-school or college dropouts. More low-performance women power through and go to college. [This skews student samples in favor of the smaller and therefore smarter male population.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886911002893) The same applies to measures of the SATs (which Lynn has also used as a metric) where many more girls than boys take the test.

Finally, brain size increases with height, and is a common explanation for the correlation between height and intelligence, AND the difference between this supposed IQ gap between men and women. Except, [that too is not supported.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976341500250X) Women and men have similar correlations between brain size and IQ, and as the author of this thorough meta-analysis on brain volume notes with surprise and/ or glee, do not exhibit differences in intelligence due to brain size. More recent studies point to brain volume being associated with differences in certain abilities (i.e. verbal, spatial), [but not general intelligence.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222842081_Sex_differences_in_brain_volume_are_related_to_specific_skills_not_to_general_intelligence)

And as one final point, studies that show a small (actually small, not Richard Lynn ""3-5 IQ points"" small) even when they are conducted accurately often fall victim to [sample restriction](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289608000962) where low-performance men are less likely to be sampled, and even LESS likely to *return* for sampling, than low-performance women, again skewing the results. Closely related to the opportunity/college samples, but distinct enough that I should mention it.

**I'm not a race realist, I'm no fan of the alt right, and everytime one of these idiots popped up I wish I had more 'ammo' to debunk their fantastical crap**

So every race post you see from me from here on, will be for the purpose of learning as much as I can about genes to beat down the race realist narrative which is really gaining too much traction online.

So on to the post in question by *Angelo John Gage*

It seems this man is not only a race realist, but a misogynist who thinks that 'un-apolagetically masculine' is best represented with stills from the 300 movie.

He has outlined 10 questions for 'race deniers'  which he says are used to *corner and refute proponents of the idea that race doesn’t exist*

He also starts the post with:
*One of these delusional ideas is that race does not exist. Of course, this is a play on words – every species on Earth has a subspecies, and “race” is simply the word used to describe a subspecies of the human species.*

So yeah this will be a lot of fun, if you have some time see if you can 'answer' his 'questions' which really seem to be statements thinly disguised as questions when he has clearly already come to his own conclusions.


* 1   If race doesn’t exist, then why do certain groups of people only produce more of their own kind? For example: When two “whites” mate, they produce whites; when two “blacks” mate, they produce blacks. Never have we once witnessed two black people producing an Asian baby, nor two white people producing a black baby, or a black couple producing a white baby. The only time Asians or Blacks can produce a “white-looking” child is when the child has albinism, and that is merely a lack of skin pigmentation.

* 2   If DNA is a molecule, and it is composed of amino acids that create a set of instructions that builds an organism, then how is it possible for race to be a social construct? In other words, how can race be a social construct if it is constructed biologically? Something that is constructed biologically is a biological construct; our labels of such things are social constructs, but they do not negate the existence of them. Race is a biological reality.

* 3  If race doesn’t exist, and we are all genetically identical, then what is diversity? Why the need for affirmative action, racial quotas, and forced integration if we are just all people with different skin colors? Skin color is just an expression of one’s unique phenotype.

* 4    If race is just skin deep, as some will claim, then why are certain groups susceptible to a certain disease when compared to those of another group? Why do we find consistent general differences in bone density, reactions to medications, skull shape, facial structure, hair texture, brain sizes, IQ levels, eye color and hormonal levels etc., between clusters of human beings that share common genetic traits and a heritage with each other? Skin is tone is just one of the many differences between human beings and race is way deeper than that.

* 5    If race doesn’t exist, then why do some people identify as “bi-racial” or “mixed”? And when we see a “bi-racial” or “mixed” person, how can we, most of the time, accurately guess which races were mixed by simply looking at them? If race doesn’t exist, what exactly has been mixed? (Tiger woods for example)

* 6   If one argues that race is social construct because there is no exact template or specific one gene that absolutely identifies someone as part of a “race” (due to the many genetic variances and expressions of each individual person) then one could argue that human beings do not exist, since there is not one human being on this planet who is exactly the same as another, and that there is no standard from which to determine who or what is a human being.

* 7   If things are considered to be social constructs because society uses labels to identify them in reality, then one can argue that reality itself does not exist since there is no way to accurately measure subatomic particles. Such line of thinking would lead to the idea that we created reality in order to define what we cannot possibly measure or prove to be real with absolute fact. Does reality not exist because we cannot measure it absolutely? Just because we cannot measure something absolutely, doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist in reality.

* 8    If people were all created equally, then why are none of us 100% identical; not even twins? How can all the races be created equal when each human being on Earth is genetically different? Clearly, no people of the same race are even equal; but, they do are share more in common genetically than those who are not of the same race. This fact is why human populations can have fixed traits that all of its members share (how white people all have white skin, and blacks all have black skin). No white person has black skin and no black person has white skin. Thus two whites are more closely related to each other than a black and a white person would be.

* 9   If one believes in evolution, than they must believe that small advantageous mutations caused new organisms to arise that were genetically different from their progenitors; thus creating a new separate group that shared particular genetic traits that their parent and other unrelated groups did not. How can one deny the existence of race if evolution shows that genetic mutations and natural selection among the human species created different groups of people who were not identical to their progenitors? Clearly the immense diversity of all the species on Earth is not denied by biologists or geneticists, so why do people buy into the idea that humans are somehow special? It is absolutely disingenuous to acknowledge the existence of different breeds of dog while simultaneously denying the different breeds (races) of man.

* 10   If one understands how genetics work, then they almost must accept the fact that genes are biological traits that can be passed down and expressed in one’s offspring. If one believes that race is a social construct, does that mean that they also believe that one can inherit a social construct? In other words, can a social construct be passed down and express in one’s offspring? The obvious answer to this questions is NO.

""***A device is worn on the mid-line of the body, and the other two on the outside of each ankle. A triangular connection takes place. This is due to a phenomenon in physics called Quantum Entanglement. A gentle subtle energy field runs between all of the devices and intersects with the nervous system.***""

Frequency is defined as a measurable rate of electrical energy flow that is constant between any 2 points. A Calibrated Frequency Monitor has been developed that has been used to measure the vibrational frequencies of humans and food. (Developed by Tainio Technology and Easter Washington University)
Human Brain is 72-90Hz
Human Body is 62-78Hz
Disease in humans:
Cold and flu start at : 57-60Hz
Disease starts at: 58Hz
Candida overgrowth: 55Hz 
Receptive to Epstein Barr: 52Hz
Receptive to Cancer: 42Hz
Death begins at: 25Hz
Clinical research shows that essential oils have the highest frequency of any natural substance known to man, creating an environment in which disease , bacteria, virus, fungus, etc cannot live. Notice that Processed food has ZERO frequency!!
Bioelectric Frequency
Processed food: 0 Hz
Fresh Produce: 15 Hz
Dry Herbs: 12-22 Hz
Fresh Herbs: 20-27 Hz
Melrose Essential Oil 42 Hz
Peppermint EO 78 Hz

Yes, yes, conspiracy is on hanging fruit, I know. But holy shit is this guy on another plane.

Ignoring the bad linguistics regarding the etymology of various words, there is still plenty of shockingly bad science to tuck in to, featuring:

Glucose isn't real,

Antibiotics don't work, because bacteria don't cause disease, toxins do,

Rich people don't vaccinate their kids, therefore vaccines are bad,

And lots lots more.

Doing a R1 is difficult in this case, as it's difficult to find the evidence that would convince a conspiracy theorist. You could get them to run chemical analyses of the compound we claim is gluten and show how the outcome can only be explained by the structure of glucose. You could show famous examples of diseases caused by bacteria (Marshall drinking the beaker of h. pylori would be my choice, as it shows the efficacy of antibiotics treatments as well). You could look to the reams of papers published showing the efficacy of vaccines. The problem is that evidence isn't convincing to a conspiracy theorist, because the answer can always be more conspiracy (who said that it is this molecule that our bodies make, Marshall was a shill, etc).",,False,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,,,self,From /r/conspiracy: antibiotics don't real,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/6xzuc1/from_rconspiracy_antibiotics_dont_real/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,

&gt;Gay men are 60x more likely to have HIV than straight men.

Right off the bat we have a common strategy of bigots which is to reference statistics with no analysis except an implication that the data justifies bigotry. A further inspection will show this implication to be unjustified. [Nieblas et al. \(2015\)](http://sci-hub.cc/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jana.2015.04.007)
reviewed the complex social dynamics that lead to risky sexual behavior and/or STI rates in homosexual men. Among contributing factors includes harmful gender stereotypes of masculinity [\(Fields et al. 2015\)](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2013.301866), internalized homophobia [\(Arreola et al. 2013\)](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2011.648028) LGBT victimization in schools [\(Russell et al. 2011\)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1746-1561.2011.00583.x/abstract), general homophobia[ \(Huebner et al. 2013\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/articles/24274807/), and inequality/stigma in healthcare [\(Magnus et al. 2013\)](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/apc.2012.0423) and [\(McKirnan et al. 2012\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22505573). Futher healthcare inequality is further exacerbated by governmental neglect carried out by the likes of Ronald Reagan [\(Vanity Fair 2015\)](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/11/reagan-administration-response-to-aids-crisis).

It appears that a reasonably detailed literature review of underlying causes of LGBT risk behavior does not conclude that being gay is the primary cause, but rather internalized and societal discrimination against LGBT individuals.

&gt;10 to 15 percent of older homosexuals have more than 1000 sex partners

The cited paper is from 1987, which beyond being old data has a different social environment contributing to LGBT behavior. It's also looking at elder gay man and ignores the fact that despite the higher partner number older men were less likely to engage in more risky sexual behavior, especially anal sex. 

A more recent study on sexual partners from 2006-2015 across sexual orientations shows that while homosexuals do have more sexual partners on average (~2.4) it's not radically more than the number of sexual partners for ~~homosexual~~ heterosexual and bisexual men (1.5
) [\(Dittis et al. 2017\)](http://sti.bmj.com/content/93/Suppl_2/A220.1).

Furthermore forces like internalized homophobia also contribute to difficulties with intimacy, sexuality and general mental health [\(Society for the Psychological Study of Lesbian and Gay Issues, 1998\)](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=L4M5DQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=sexual+partners+gay+men&amp;ots=LjkIe_JkVh&amp;sig=80XX06IQ1Wy8nHo-Kgg3cTiHgIE#v=onepage&amp;q=sexual%20partners%20gay%20men&amp;f=false), which all play a role in healthy relationships.

&gt;40% to 60% of serial killers are homosexuals.

What this user fails to attempt is to understand the underlying causes for this apparent relationship. In a study on serial sex homicides, [Stone \(2001\)](http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/pedi.15.1.1.18646)
uncovered a relationship between internalized homophobia in homosexual serial killers and their murders.
&gt; the homosexual group were burdened for the
most part with intense self-hatred regarding their own homosexuality that
was then projected outward onto their male victims (who either were gay or
whom their attackers thought were gay)

This would imply that discrimination and stigmatization against gay people, not homosexuality itself is underlying this apparent relationship.

Furthermore this quip ignores other contributing factors related to serial killers such as mental illness, substance abuse, fatherless homes, sexual molestation, child abuse, and several others. 

To drop this bare statistic without any analysis is pure bigotry.

&gt;Gay men, 1% of the population, account for 83% of syphilis cases. 
Gay men are 15 times more likely to have Hepatitis B than everyone else.

Considering the high risk behavior for STIs is common (unprotected anal sex, drug/alcoholo use prior to sex, non-disclosure of infection status, and number of sexual partners) the analysis for HIV is just as valid for Hep B and syphillis.

Ironically enough it appears that discrimination against homosexual men, rather than being homosexual is a driver of the harms faced by homosexual men.

I also want to make clear that a majority of my criticisms are coming from Dr. Elisabeth Bik whose twitter thread on the paper can be found [here](https://twitter.com/MicrobiomDigest/status/887014504227192832)

R1: To start off the researchers attempt to study the human microbiome in blood and place the identified operational taxanomic units (OTUs) in a phylogenetic context with each other as well as humans. To do this they download reference sequence data from the human microbiome project that were sampled from human blood. Here's where the first problem begins:


**1.**The sequences they collect are almost entirely Streptococcus and Enterococcus (37/43). These bacteria are not typical of healthy blood. While a majority of the sequences are not associated with any publication that I could find, at least [one paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22769602) of a published Enterococcus faecium strain from the human microbiome project was studying the genome of a pathogenic bacteria related to hospital infection. If the samples this study is using all come from infected individuals then they are not getting a true snapshot of the microbiome in blood, if we can say one confidently exists. [Previous research](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/trf.13477/full) that conducted a 16S metagenomic survey of human blood found a radically different microbial composition with firmicutes (the phylum of Streptococcus and Enterococcus) only comprising ~6% of red blood cell microbe diversity and only ~10% of raw reads. Dr. Bik argues against the existence of a consistent blood microbiome, which could be the case though I didn't find work supporting this claim. Even granting it does exist their sampling clearly doesn't follow what the taxonomic diversity actually looks like.

**2.**When conducting taxonomic sampling the authors partake in classic cherry picking. 

&gt;For the analysis on blood tissue type, we
had to exclude 2 microbes which if taken into account, would have made the count
of common proteins very less, thereby making the analysis weak

If the decision to exclude two samples was based on the quality or reliability of the genome assembly there's no issue, but their sole justification is that they had too few shared proteins which would complicate or invalidate their analyses. Even basic reference genome analysis could show whether the assembly was low quality, thus leading to low protein count. They didn't do this analysis and instead fit their sampling to fit their methodology which is a dubious act given their attempting to create a phylogeny of the human blood microbiome.

**3.** Now on to the bioinformatic analysis: The authors claim to find common proteins from the FASTA sequence files. They provide no explanation of how they did this (whether through blast or comparison of amino acid sequences). One jaw-dropping feat they did was convert their FASTA files into tabular spreadsheets because 

&gt;Since
now the data is in table form it is easy to access, collate, manipulate, and to do analysis
stuff.

Nevermind that FASTA is the default sequence file format with multiple tools capable of using it as input. Through some unknown method they identify 22 'common proteins'  which presumably are just conserved proteins. 

From these proteins they made a phylogenetic tree of their samples (37/43 of which are from just two genera). Which leads us to 

**4.** When making their phylogenetic tree, the authors did not concatenate their protein sequences (good job on that on actually), but instead 'aggregated' the phylogenies. They're methodology for doing this was to simply average the sequence distance matrices of each tree into a single matrix, and that's important because generating a species tree from several gene trees is not a trivial task. Here's an example of [one tool](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/25/7/971/210707) designed to form species trees from gene trees and a [review paper](http://dna.ac/filogeografia/PDFs/coalesc/Degnan&amp;Rosenberg_09_GeneTrees_SppTrees.pdf) on the subject. **in their defense** the likelihood of major incongruence occurring in a sampling of closely related genera is very minor, but in that case a simple concatenation based method would be better than a naive consensus based one.

**5.** The resulting tree is very much what one would expect if they make a phylogeny of mostly Streptococcus and Enterococcus. Namely a tree with those two taxa sister to each other. The authors claim

&gt;The bacteria
Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus sanguinis show correlation which vindicates
the theoretical understanding that they both belongs to same class; (ii) Enterococcus
faecium and Enterocococcus faecalis both belong to a phylum known as Firmicutes,
and both show strong correlation; (iii) Some other bacteria (although few) show some
relationships for some of the proteins with Streptococcus sanguinis which indicates their
evolutionary closeness and similarity.

Let's break these down. (i) I have no idea how their analysis vindicates anything or how Enterococcus and Streptococcus both being in the class bacilli is somehow only a theoretical understanding. (ii) Those two Enterococci are very obviously in the same genera, I have no idea why they decided to emphasize they're the same phylum. (iii) again this is just a phylogenetic analysis literally doing it's job.

**6.** The end gets very hard to understand, but they basically identify conserved proteins and regions in sequence shared between bacteria and humans and are trying to claim some significance of this homology. Of course, homology is not surprising considering life evolved from a common ancestor. Especially when all the identified common genes are general housekeeping stuff. They also seem surprised that there is evolutionary divergence between blood microbes.

&gt;Deletion of proteins from the evolutionary new microbes might also be a cause behind
the observation of limited commonness between all the species in a single tissue

which makes me think they don't realize these species exist in a context outside of humans that would lead to divergence and occupation of a common environment.

With the technical and conceptual mistakes made by the authors it's a total shock that this paper was published, especially in a reasonable respected journal like MPE.

While I want to make it clear that I do think global warming is happening, the region in which the iceberg is broke off (the Larsen C) does not see the surface melting ice of regions of the Antarctic which are affected by global warming. This is much more probably a natural process, as this happens all the time and this iceberg just happens to be especially large (although it is not the largest-apparently in 1950s the US navy claimed to have observed as 35,000 sq km iceberg, although the lack of satellites at the time makes this hard to verify). I'm not sure why people keep talking about how this is global warming and bringing up the Paris Climate Accord when this isn't linked to global warming and that's easily verifiable by a quick google search (maybe people really do just like to think of the world as black and white, with no nuance). Anyway, this was just pissing me off at work and had to write something about it.

---

I've been reading up on the therodynamics behind the Five Element construct of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and it appears that these Elements, in the language of Western science, correspond to different regions of the plane that spans two axes: that of energy and that of entropy. According to *Five Spirits: Alchemical Acupuncture for Psychological and Spiritual Healing*, by Lorie Eve Dechar, The Five elements correspond to five approximately (or exactly?) 72 (one fifth of 360) degree sectors of this plane, with the origin at the most lifeless point in the plane. I'm having trouble figuring out how to align this wheel of five secants with the axis, though. What are the dividing angles?

For reference, below is how the plane is segregated when I use the eight child court cards of the Aliester Crowley Thoth Tarot deck as labels for eight octants. In this diagram, the energy axis is pointing up and the entropy axis is pointing to the left. (So that negentropy, which is the energetic analog of entropy, points to the right.) Also note that the angles are only equal if the units of energy and entropy are properly proportioned to each other.

|Legend/Key:
|-
|**phase**
|**emotion**
|**human sound**

-|-|Hot Smoothness|-|-
-|-|-|-|-
-|-|**lust**|-|-
-|-|**sustained low voice**|-|
-|**Smoothing Heat**|-|**Cooling Smoothness**|-
-|**mirth**|-|**awe**|-
-|**pulsed rough breath**|-|**pulsed low voice**|-
**Rough Heat**|-|-|-|**Smooth Cold**
**rage**|-|-|-|**care**
**sustained rough breath**|-|-|-|**sustained smooth breath**
-|**Heating Roughness**|-|**Roughing Cold**|-
-|**thrill**|-|**grief**|-
-|**pulsed high voice**|-|**pulsed smooth breath**|-
-|-|**Cold Roughness**|-|-
-|-|**fear**|-|-
-|-|**sustained high voice**|-|-

* Note the difference between the low and high voice; one cannot switch between them smoothely, and trying to do so results in a discrete jump in pitch; oscillating back and forth between them creates a yodel.

* Also note the difference between the smooth and rough breath; the smooth breath is created by a lung contraction with the throat relaxed, whereas with a rough breath, the throat contracts at a spot slightly higher than the vocal chords, creating a guttural growling sound.

Using the same Legend/Key, below are the five regions of the Traditional Chinese segmentation of the plane, labeled using the table in *The Web that has No Weaver*, by Ted J. Kaptchuk, and supplemented by *Five Spirits* where vocabulary differs.

|Wood
|-
|**anger**
|**shouting**

|Fire
|-
|**elation/joy**
|**laughing**

|Earth
|-
|**pensiveness/sympathy**
|**singing**

|Metal
|-
|**grief**
|**weeping**

|Water
|-
|**fear**
|**groaning**

Now to align these two wheels to each other. Where do they surely match up? Well, I see grief on both wheels, so I'll start there. Weeping is a pulsing smooth breath... yeah that looks right. So I think it's safe to say that every angle of the Roughing Cold octant falls within the Metal sector. Assuming each Traditional Chinese sector corresponds to an equally large 72 degree pentant, then this gives us only 72 - 45 = 27 degrees of uncertainty between the two wheels. Good enough to make another diagram:

-|-|-|Fire|-|-|-
-|-|-|-|-|-|-
-|-|-|**elation/joy**|-|-|-
-|-|-|**laughing**|-|-|-
-|-|-|-|-|-|-
-|-|-|**Hot Smoothness**|-|-|-
-|-|-|**lust**|-|-|-
**Wood**|-|-|**sustained low voice**|-|-|**Earth**
**anger**|-|**Smoothing Heat**|-|**Cooling Smoothness**|-|**pensiveness/sympathy**
**shouting**|-|**mirth**|-|**awe**|-|**singing**
-|-|**pulsed rough breath**|-|**pulsed low voice**|-|-
-|**Rough Heat**|-|-|-|**Smooth Cold**|-
-|**rage**|-|-|-|**care**|-
-|**sustained rough breath**|-|-|-|**sustained smooth breath**|-
-|-|**Heating Roughness**|-|**Roughing Cold**|-|-

-|**Water**|-|**Cold Roughness**|-|**Metal**|-

Several explanations for the horrifying situation are discussed in the article (link further down), including bad attitudes towards children with congenital disabilities, and lack of resources for the orphanages. Still, there was one claim that was nothing but bad science in every form:

&gt; One orphanage director blamed the situation on the psychological state of the children themselves. “The reason why they do not put on weight lies not in the malnutrition but in their psyche. There is no accessibility as there is no brain there. They have absolutely different processes.”

Rule 1: Claiming that people with congenital disabilities, be they mental or physical, lack a brain is both outrageous and obviously false. Some of the processes may work differently or don't work at all, but that is just the reason they are disabilities in the first place.    
If not having a brain were the case, the child would most certainly not be alive, at least in any conventional sense (brain-dead people can have their bodies kept alive, but that's another story). And the only thing there is to do about malnutrition is to improve nutrition, in both quality and quantity. And after that, it's mostly a deal of educating people and changing their attitudes, to make sure claims like the one discussed won't come up in the first place, as well as making sure people with disabilities are treated like they should, in accordance with their needs.

R1: 

&gt;Few dare speak the truth about people with Asperger’s Syndrome (AS) (now classified as part of ASD, or “autism spectrum disorder”). When the truth comes out, a militant mob is mobilized. Their goal is to pummel the truth-tellers into silence, which leaves their partners without the information and support they need.

40 points for comparing yourself to Galileo, suggesting that a modern-day Inquisition is hard at work on your case, and so on. 

&gt;What is this unspeakable truth those with AS try so hard to hide from the world? 

See above. Any sort of talk about ""unspeakable hidden truths"" is conspiracy talk.

&gt;They are incapable of empathy. And because of their lack of empathy, their spouses, partners and children suffer extreme emotional neglect, abuse and significant trauma. 

Actual science I can debunk! Of course, a slightly autistic mate is not best for all or even most, but their inability to feel empathy [is an urban legend that's been refuted in *Scientific American*.](https://spectrumnews.org/opinion/viewpoint/people-with-autism-can-read-emotions-feel-empathy/) 

&gt;People with AS have no idea they lack empathy. Their disorder not only prevents them from having empathy, but from knowing they don’t. This is the reason they become so angry at any claim that they are empathy-deficient.

See above. Not crackpottery, just wrong. 

&gt;Partners of those with AS are not believed about the difficulty in their lives. A US physician who has seen their trauma and tragedy has spoken out against colleagues’ neglect of their emotional and psychological well-being, even though there is a risk of damage to his own career and reputation:

40 points for claiming that the ""scientific establishment"" is engaged in a ""conspiracy"" to prevent your work from gaining its well-deserved fame, or suchlike. 

&gt;Partners of those with AS are not believed about the difficulty in their lives. A US physician who has seen their trauma and tragedy has spoken out against colleagues’ neglect of their emotional and psychological well-being, even though there is a risk of damage to his own career and reputation:

&gt;“Physicians and other professionals do not acknowledge the disorder’s existence, even though its existence is a necessary logical consequence of established medical knowledge. That disorder is known as Ongoing Traumatic Relationship Syndrome or the Cassandra Phenomenon. Even more astounding, the victims’ cries for help are being angrily refuted by another large group of individuals who do not have the disorder… Can you imagine if this were the case for a form of cancer or liver disease? Can you imagine a group of militant individuals (who’ve never had heart disease) arguing that heart patients don’t really suffer chest pain or shortness of breath?”

An anonymous doctor, and the link is to a site (theneurotypical.com) [that doesn't actually state its author.](http://theneurotypical.com/about_us.html) It's not a completely new phrase (I'm finding some results for it outside of theneurotypical and heartlessaspergers, but they're rare), but Ongoing Traumatic Relationship Syndrome is not a recognized diagnosis. 

10 points for each new term you invent and use without properly defining it; we've already covered all the conspiracy stuff.

It has now been rectified.

[Chinese the most dishonest, Japanese and British the least, study finds](http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/1879850/chinese-most-dishonest-japanese-and-british-least-study-finds)

A 2015 newspaper article stated that a study showed Chinese people to be the least honest and Japanese and British people to be the most honest. A closer examination of the data, however, shows that this presentation of the study is inaccurate. 

The study consisted of two parts. The first consisted of having participants flip a coin. If the coin landed on heads, the participant would receive a monetary reward. Countries that have more people land on heads are considered more dishonest. The second part consisted of asking participants to complete a difficult online quiz, with a monetary reward for those who got one hundred percent. If they get any mark other than one out of whatever total number of questions the quiz had, they are assumed to be cheating. 

In the first portion, the Japanese participants were considered the second most dishonest. In the second portion, the Japanese participants were considered the least dishonest. These two data points do not prove that Japanese people are more honest; instead, they indicate that the study may have several flaws that prevented it from accurately gauging honesty, as it is unlikely that someone who is dishonest for one activity would magically become honest for the next. 

In fact, only three countries (Russia, Argentina, and Brazil) are shown to possess the same amount of dishonesty according to both methodologies. 

While coin flips are mostly random, how well people understand the content on the music quiz can differ from country to country. Furthermore, in poorer countries, the people who have internet access and were able to access the study's online tests are more likely to be educated and rich people. As a result, the coin flip test is likely a better representation of honesty than the quiz. 

The newspaper article mentioned no caveats of the study, which is important to do for a study that links to sensitive political issues and could trigger hatred towards certain groups of people. The newspaper article also did not specify how the participants were chosen or whether the methods could have skewed the results. 

A more accurate headline might be ""Chinese, Japanese people less honest than British people."" Or maybe the post should have never carried the story entirely, considering its glaring flaws, the potential for bias, and the potential to generate racism against people of Turkish, Chinese, and Indian descent.",,False,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,,,self,"The second most dishonest country is the most honest, 2015 newspaper article states as it reports on a study",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/5sxnt3/the_second_most_dishonest_country_is_the_most/,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '1ZXOydxxhx6WZR91__ilGAMcwtYU6cpGcdXYS1P_Gio', 'resolutions': [{'height': 62, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/mx7iiyyA1E-_REpY_-D3MNXhXIr6E306VP1_JQs4tzo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=f870a1f3b3eba4adb79a705ffb55831e', 'width': 108}, {'height': 124, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/mx7iiyyA1E-_REpY_-D3MNXhXIr6E306VP1_JQs4tzo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=c8c66f854f59db99d695d116bfd632f5', 'width': 216}, {'height': 183, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/mx7iiyyA1E-_REpY_-D3MNXhXIr6E306VP1_JQs4tzo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=9512a288d640a5ce28636b2abea60ed6', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 356, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/mx7iiyyA1E-_REpY_-D3MNXhXIr6E306VP1_JQs4tzo.jpg?s=e040bfb47557426ebcf0310779a19643', 'width': 620}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,{},,{},,,,,,,,,,1486697799.0,,,,,,0.0,,,False,,,,,1485314936.0,,

Let me preface this by saying that the fat earth theory is blatantly ridiculous. 

However, just because your opponent doesn't know what he's talking about, doesn't mean that you do. 

full thread: https://np.reddit.com/r/flatearthsociety/comments/5cotsv/gravity_does_not_exist/d9yl0ur/

(Note that the flat earth model here is an earth that's uniformly accelerating at 9.8 m/s² forever)

&gt; Do the math. It takes about a year to get to light speed. That's a prediction your model makes. It is a hallmark of science that models make predictions. If the predictions are confirmed, the model can become an accepted theory. However, the fact that the earth moon system would, within a year, begin to approach the speed of light, with all the relativistic implications of that falsifies the model.


Nope, uniform acceleration is perfectly possible for as long as you want. While an observer in an inertial reference frame will watch you slowly approach the speed of light and never reach it, to a person uniformly accelerating, the acceleration remains, well, uniform. 

&gt; Then you just debunked the entire premise. Vf=Vo+at. figure you start from stationary. so Vf=at. 60 seconds in a minute60 minutes in an hour24 hours in a day*365.25 (for leap years) days in a year = 31,557,600 seconds in a year. 9.8 m/s2 * 31,557,600 seconds in a year gives me a final velocity of 309,264,480 m/s. Which is a problem since the speed of light is only 299,792,458...

Those formula's don't work in SR/GR because both a,t,Vf and Vo  are different depending on the reference frame, so you can't just blindly apply them. 

&gt; Just think about this for a second. say you are going 1 m/s under the speed of light. You then accelerate at 9.8 m/s. whaT happens?
edit. it is the famous you are 10 ft from a wall and every step takes you half the remaining distance to it. do you ever touch the wall. The answer is no.

In the reference frame where you're moving almost at the speed of light, you of course can't accelerate at 9.8 m/s². In the uniformly accelerating reference frame/ inertial reference frame where you set the speed of the uniformly accelerating object at 0 for some time t=t_0, then yes, you can perfectly accelerate at 9.8 m/s².

&gt; So we have been accelerating at a super quadratically increasing energy demand for 4.5 billion years?

No, the energy demands remain the same.

 I know we do race realism here a lot, but I don't want this shit normalized.

Anyway, here's my R1 copied from the comment I made:

IQ heritability is horrendously overestimated due to the typical models used in twin studies. A massive reduction was seen after including just one factor; common [maternal environment](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v388/n6641/abs/388468a0.html). More importantly the heritability of IQ seems to be extremely mediated by environmental factors like socio-economic status or home environment ([1](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/14/6/623.short),[2](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/08/30/0956797613488394.short),[3](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289615000987),[4](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-014-9428-0),[5](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127052#sec016)) Not only that but the ability to find genes or loci associated to IQ through GWAS has turned up nearly zilch, most likely because the genetics of IQ is highly polygenic which is bad news for race-realist arguments of IQ because the genetic difference between 'races' is so miniscule and the likelihood of all those small-effect being in tight linkage and segregating together is so small that there's virtually no chance that IQ has strong genetic segregation between racial populations.
Regardless though, the actual heritability of IQ doesn't matter because [heritability does not mean genetically determined](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/hgjc/hgjc_2012-03-09b.pdf) 

The analysis of STRUCTURE results from Pritchard et al. and other studies is also pretty flawed. First off, programs like STRUCTURE will spit out a given number of clusters regardless of how significant they really are. So if you go out looking to separate humans into 5 groups vaguely resembling race, you're probably going to find it. Furthermore the population structure derived doesn't necessarily reflect the traditional concept of race. It reflected geographic ancestry, which is a distinct concept that can sometimes be muddled by genetic heterogeneity. (For more see [1](http://www.jstor.org/stable/682042?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents),[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3737365/),[3](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v36/n11s/full/ng1435.html?iframe=true&amp;width=100%&amp;%20rel=),[4](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v424/n6947/full/424374a.html)[,5](http://philpapers.org/archive/PIGWAW.pdf)).

As for 'Low black admixture in whites' you're greatest explanation for that is that admixture tests only look at alleles that differ between populations and ignore ones that are similar (for the most part). Because of shared ancestry and the extreme genetic similarity (muh Lewontin's fallacy /s) you're missing the forest from the trees. white and black people share essentially all of their genome because we all originated from the same African population, the small geographic differences that occur since then are of little impact or importance.

These are the areas I feel the most comfortable speaking as a geneticist/genomicist/evolutionary biologist. Some of those sources are valid, some are not (e.g. never trust anything from Rushton, Jensen, etc). Nearly all of them have been misinterpreted to pitch a false narrative.",,False,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,,,self,Race Realism on Subreddit of the Day,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/5d28fi/race_realism_on_subreddit_of_the_day/,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,1438289450.0,,

Made me wonder if he knew he wrote this paper.

Strangely, I can't find any other references to this guy online aside from the PubMed entries. His co-author on the cancer papers, Pacini, is  apparently controversial but continues to publish (see comments [here](http://www.nature.com/news/italian-stem-cell-trial-based-on-flawed-data-1.13329)).

This article is bad. Like, so much bad.

&gt;Donald Trump’s election victory is only a shock if you have been looking at the world through simple equations. Classical physics is rooted Newton’s three laws, where an action has an equal reaction, objects at rest tend to stay there, and force equals mass times acceleration.

Well, Classical Mechanics didn't predict that Hillary Clinton would have won. In fact, Classical Mechanics doesn't predict outcomes of elections. They predict how macroscopic objects would behave in Inertial Reference Frames. 

&gt; Newton describes the observable world in ways that are logical. But long ago, scientists showed the underlying physical world can’t be explained with algebra. To understand the universe, classical physics had to incorporate quantum mechanics, which describes a micro-world of uncertainty and ambiguity that is harder to measure but defines our true reality. Likewise, as recent geopolitical shocks have proven, outdated methods are no longer capable or sufficient to explain global society’s complex and interconnected systems.

Implying Quantum Mechanics *isn't* logical? Also, Quantum Mechanics incorporates quite a bit of algebra. A lot of Calculus, but so does Classical Mechanics if you go to the nitty-gritty of it. Also, what's the point of saying ""classical physics had to incorporate quantum mechanics""? That makes absolutely no sense. Classical Physics and Quantum Mechanics are two different systems of looking at reality. Classical Physics didn't incorporate Quantum Mechanics. *Physics* incorporated Quantum Mechanics.

&gt; Quantum mechanics’ principles are actually quite clear: Units are difficult to quantify, and they’re in perpetual motion; invisible objects can occupy space; there are no causal certainties, only correlations and probabilities; gravity matters more than location; and meaning is derived relationally rather than from absolutes. Relatively is the rule. Indeed, the principles of quantum mechanics are, when explained in art, quite clear. Take this example:

WHAT. JUST WHAT. Do I really have to Rule 1 this paragraph? There is literally nothing in this paragraph that correctly describes Quantum Mechanics' Principles. Quantum Mechanics' Principles are, according to Paul Dirac:

* The Principle of superposition
* Dynamical variables and observables
* Representations
* The quantum conditions
* The equations of motion
* Elementary applications
* Perturbation theory
* Collision problems
* Systems containing several similar particles
* Theory of radiation
* Relativistic theory of the electron
* Quantum electrodynamics

Okay, so maybe one or two parts of Quartz' article kinda-sorta fits. But they pertain to Atoms and Electrons. Sure, Donald Trump is made of Atoms and Electrons. But he is clearly alive and is President. He's not both President and not President in some sort of Schrodinger's Election.

&gt; Today, in the wake of the Trump win, there is no more important question that we can ask about the emerging world order than this: Can we understand geopolitics if we don’t understand its physics?

TIL that geopolitics follows the laws of physics. [Spoiler: it doesn't]

&gt;  Recent quantum experiments imply that time itself is the result of the entanglement of particles that temporally share the same existence, even though they are different units.  

This sentence doesn't make sense. What ""units"" are you talking about? Seconds? Meters? Candela? Besides, how can time be ""the result of the entanglement of particles that temporally share the same existence"" when [time isn't quantized] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronon)?

&gt; Sound confusing? As theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson once put it, “The difference between classical and quantum physics is that quantum physics is weird.”

No. The sentence sounds confusing because you just pulled things out of your ass.

&gt; Geopolitical thinking, which is still governed by an antiquated, Newtonian logic  should be looked at through a quantum mechanics lens.

It wasn't, and never has. Also, you don't look at Newtonian Physics through a Quantum Lens. The two are mutually incompatible because they describe different systems. Because the [De Broglie relation] (http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistryglossary/a/debroglieeqdef.htm) is inversely proportional to mass, and since Trump's toupee is macroscopic, it has a vanishingly small wavelength. PEOPLE ARE NOT QUANTUM PARTICLES.

&gt; Recent headlines, like Brexit and Trump, have been dominated by stories that require us to trace intangible butterfly effects to fully understand. For example, one of the triggers of the Arab Spring that exploded in early 2011 was the spike in food prices in Egypt and Tunisia. The countries’ main source of wheat imports was Russia, where a drought six months earlier forced Moscow to ban exports for the first time ever. (America’s ethanol-subsidies and global-commodities market speculation also played key roles, not to mention the countries themselves crossing the tipping point of intolerable political and social stagnation.)

Not Bad Science, but I'd like to point out that this is how historians have viewed World Events for like, centuries now. Just saying.

&gt; Complexity makes a mockery of linear projections. It made a mockery of Hillary Clinton’s projected win. Forecasting the GDP growth of oil-dependent economies proved to be a big mistake as commodities prices suddenly collapsed in 2014. Similarly, valuing tech companies based on projected future earnings belies the reality of new rivals’ business models or disruptive technologies suddenly making them worthless. In a complex world, chaos is the new normal; we are all price takers.

Okay, so how was this predicted by Newtonian Physics? What wavefunction was used to predict that Hillary Clinton would lose?

&gt; Small and large-scale phenomena are deeply connected in complex systems. Just as electrons can suddenly experience “quantum leaps” in their energy state, tiny animal mutations can rapidly morph into global pandemics such as the H5N1 Bird Flu, normal stock market trading activity can be tipped into a massive and instantaneous downward spiral such as the 2010 “Flash Crash,” and terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda or hacker collectives such as Wikileaks can appear dormant until the moment they launch a major attack. ISIS affiliates can strike in Paris and form alliances with Boko Haram in Nigeria while being bombarded by NATO on its home turf.

Uhh... No. Those two aren't comparable at all. An atom getting promoted to a higher energy state is in reaction to an input of the right kind of energy. It doesn't change the atom at all. It's not a ""tiny animal mutation"" that ""rapidly morphs into a pandemic"". It's not even Apples to Oranges. It's an Apples to Potatoes comparison.

The rest of the article becomes a mess of philosophy and pandering to ""complexity theory"" that has nothing to do with physics.

The diameter of the Earth is roughly 8000 miles. The distance from the Earth to the Moon is roughly 240,000 miles. Given these numbers, the moon should be roughly 30 Earth diameters away, not one diameter as pictured here. I will concede that this distance may be possible if the Moon is closer or farther away from the camera, but given that their relative sizes appear correct, this would only be possible if the camera was very very far away and using a very telescopic lens. 

The proportion of the Sun and Earth is also strange. While the Sun is much larger than the Earth, it's much *much* larger than the comparison in this poster assuming the natural distances are ignored. If they were respected, then the Sun shouldn't appear much bigger here than it does in our sky.

I'm going to give the angle of the Moon's orbit a pass since there isn't much information given on the angle of the photograph relative to the orbit of the Earth. Can't really make out Earth's geography enough to find its poles or equator. 

Why can we see an illuminated sliver on the Moon and Earth when the only source of light nearby is directly opposite the photographer?

What does the golden spiral have to do with anything?

And I don't have anything to back this up, but I'm hoping a solar astronomer can comment on the fact that the Sun seems brightest around its edges.

&gt; sees as one way street

What?
&gt;  is reductionist

That means, science? Every science needs to first reduce system and explore simpler system. Usually you are able to explain quite decent chunk of variability. What is awesome, sometimes you can explain apparently complex behaviour with very simple model. This recently is a big thing in popgen, where they were able to explain interesting shifts in allele frequency as just a way how geographic dispersion on 2d plane works, instead of inherently complex thoughts and models about evolutionary advantages of such alleles.

Reductionism is a reason why natural science did so much progress, while social science. Hell, it is base for science and large part of math, it is basically a way how to do science. Parsimony principle. Occam's razor.

Have you ever done science I must ask? Have you ever tried to build non-reductionist model? You would quickly drown in complexity and inability to interpret it anyhow, because you would not be able to put your hand on anything. First, you must build a base and then you can build on that base of knowledge and simple models.

&gt; it flows from cultural practices, not blind reaction to environmental conditions

Straw man. Sure, as we see from other reductionist experiments, existence of rule, even if the result is negative, will quickly fix in society. However, one must ask, where did the cultural tradition came from?

&gt; lets look at history of this line of thinking

We praise various greek philosophers for their wrong conclusions, but attempt at explaining world around them. But because someone made bad conclusion 2000 years ago means that whole science is just pseudoscience?

&gt; application of theory of evolution to culture was terrible idea

WHAT? Who? How? Citation needed. So I am currently doing pseudoscience, when I am using methods originally build for phylogenetics to build tree from linguistical data? Most of modern cultural work is basically using this idea! Have you never heard about evolution of kinship systems? All the work that was done on this by Murdock? Big part of antropology consisted of collecting ethnographic data (i.e., freely accessible ethnographic atlas http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/worldcul/atlas.htm ) to discover relationship between various cultural practices! However, given there is certain evolutionary relationship between cultures, they had to deal with so called Galton's problem. Because of modern methods that deals with character evolution and various evolutionary models are suddenly starting to be applied to this data, this part of science is basically being resurrected and can probide some evidence supported by not only musing, but hard science. Look at this guy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Gray

&gt; changing seasons ... stimulating population ... which is ridiculous

Because changing seasons that enable food gathering only for relatively short amount time create no pressure for, I don't know, organization, distribution, storage? Or even thinking in cycles or forward planing? This is ridiculous!

&gt; racist ... only Europeans produced civilization

While not only Europeans produced something we call now civilization, you can't deny that Europeans had serious lead in scientific progress, had industrial revolution and conquered and colonized big part of world. Considering that this was not true in 10th century and a lot of parts of world were more advanced at the time or had various parts of necessary technology or cultural tradition (Chinese mined natural gas before it was cool, Arabs had very good tradition in science, before it started to be uncool). That lead to question: Why was that? Explaining that as simple racism is not only simplistic and reductionistic, it is wrong and pseudoscientific.

&gt; it was politically used to justify exploitation, thus it is wrong and pseudoscience

Eh?

Chemistry and physic, that allows gunpowder to expand and force bullet out of gun, is wrong and pseudoscientific because you can kill people with that and thats wrong?

&gt; I dispute Jared's argument

I watched this part 5 times. You didn't disputed them. Just just described them and claimed that they are wrong and racist.

Sure, they may be wrong and reductionist. But unless you say why it is wrong, describe where it fails to fit data, we won't get anywhere in science.

If you don't know about Sargon and the rest of ""rational"" YouTube, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc24YtUslCU)'s a good introduction to him.

#R1
##Misunderstanding science
At 0:40, he says that introducing people to environmental determinism with a warning is ""poisoning the well"" because people should be allowed to decide for themselves if it's correct, or something.

At 1:12 he criticizes Crash Course calling environmental determinism ""bad science"". He says ""she's suggesting science is subjective and people get to choose their own"", which is not an accurate portrayal of someone calling an outdated field wrong.

##Actually defending determinism
At 1:56 he comes out and says ""well isn't that a reasonable explanation?"" in response to the definition of determinism. This is not only totally wrong, but the antithesis of the video he's criticizing, which is an explanation of why determinism is a poor way to analyze the world.

At 14:51 he calls environmental determinism ""self-evident"", as if to discredit the entire academic field of human geography by saying ""well you're wrong because common sense"".

##Some bullshit about the Inuit
At 15:00 he says ""For example, Eskimos have never invented the concept of the god-king"" and supports this with the assertion that only peoples in sub-Arctic climates would need a sun god because there the sun rises and sets daily.

As a matter of fact, the Inuit did have a solar deity, Malina.
&gt;Malina is the Sun goddess of the Inuit people who live in Greenland, and Anningan is the Moon god. Malina and Anningan used to live together but, one day, they had a terrible argument and began to fight each other … Malina tries to stay away from her brother, which is why the Sun and Moon set at different times.

As a materials scientist, I always feel strangely left out of badscience discussions. There's plenty of people willing to comment publicly on their mistaken understanding of evolution or quantum mechanics, yet people are strangely reticent to make bold assertions on graphene nanoplatelets. So I couldn't pass this up.

&gt; Not all protection sprays work this way. This is specifically because it uses nanotechnology surfaces to create a very smooth surface, allowing water to flow off the shoe without breaking its surface tension.

Referring to something as a nanotechnology surface is perhaps a bit weird. The explanation of how the spray works is also incorrect, at least according to the manufacturer's claims (the manufacturer claims that they utilise the lotus effect, which is usually replicated by a combination of micro- or nano- particulates in a hydrophobic coating)

The use of 'nanotechnology surface' causes outrage, and brings this monster to life

&gt; No, it's not. Chemistry and molecular behavior are not the same as nanotechnology, and a layman using that term to sell someone on a product is ridiculous. **Nanotechnology involves machines or mechanisms that directly manipulate specific, individual molecules.** Because a shoe spray works on a molecular level (just like every other chemical compound ever) does not mean it has anything to do with nanotechnology whatsoever.

(emphasis added)

This is an entirely incorrect definition of nanotechnology. It sounds like an entirely sci-fi definition, hinting at nano-bots and replicators. Unfortunately the actual definition is much more mundane (technology that operates at the nano-scale). The posted definition would exclude pretty much all the nano-technology that currently exists, as well as dramatically limiting the scope of nanotechnology (what about nanomaterials that generate energy?)

I do have some sympathy to being annoyed at the co-opting of science terminology by commercial products (Looking at you, [Finish Quantum](http://www.mrsjanuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Sale-on-Finish-Quantum-20.jpeg)), but this is one of the few times where it's potentially correctly applied. 

&gt;Dude I hate doing the credentials pissing match thing, but I do know what I'm talking about.

&gt; The guy who inspired me to pursue physics as a career, Richard Feynman, is commonly credited with forming the first clear path for the field in question here. Here's the wiki page on that for easy reading.
&gt;&gt;""There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom"" was a lecture given by physicist Richard Feynman at an American Physical Society meeting at Caltech on December 29, 1959. Feynman considered the possibility of direct manipulation of individual atoms as a more powerful form of synthetic chemistry than those used at the time. The talk went unnoticed and it didn't inspire the conceptual beginnings of the field. In the 1990s it was rediscovered and publicised as a seminal event in the field, probably to boost the history of nanotechnology with Feynman's reputation.


Oh no, they were inspired by Richard Feynman, there's no way they could be incorrect. This is in response to being given a correct definition of nanotechnology (from a nanotechnology institute, no less). Funnily enough a 55 year old lecture by Feynman probably isn't the best source for what the current scope of nanotechnology is, any more than reading '*On the Origin of Species*' would give you an understanding of the detailed genetic studies that constitute the current work carried out in evolutionary biology.",,,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,,,self,Nanotechnology inspires a chain of badscience in malefashionadvice,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/53m8wc/nanotechnology_inspires_a_chain_of_badscience_in/,,,,self,"{'images': [{'id': 'neyxpKqxrT4wTWLOevW3BWJem67pA5rmIRZaSslyBaM', 'resolutions': [{'height': 86, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/HB9JLGGNs_NiiZ2RqZINhkYcrCfYA6TwT7WEVnabxYk.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=9f054855b9c2594bfef56a281de030b6', 'width': 108}, {'height': 172, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/HB9JLGGNs_NiiZ2RqZINhkYcrCfYA6TwT7WEVnabxYk.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=b32c4a28d2b82235a3378621d18b35b9', 'width': 216}, {'height': 256, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/HB9JLGGNs_NiiZ2RqZINhkYcrCfYA6TwT7WEVnabxYk.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=e09794506c58b74cd5a85c76712845cd', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 368, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/HB9JLGGNs_NiiZ2RqZINhkYcrCfYA6TwT7WEVnabxYk.jpg?s=f0ef941860d6c73865062e9d3d71e7a1', 'width': 460}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,{},,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,1328566598.0,,

First of all, water does not combust. If we, however, assume that they mean that the water is separated into hydrogen and oxygen and the hydrogen is burnt, then it's technically right but still dumb and does not result in a ""water powered"" car.

~~Le Chatelier's principle~~ **Hess's Law** states that the change in enthalpy (energy) for a chemical reaction remains the same regardless of the path taken between the products and reactants. In this case, the energy required to separate water (the reactant) into hydrogen and oxygen will be the same as the amount of energy released by burning the hydrogen to form water (the final product). If we assume that the system is designed to convert electrical energy from the battery to heat, and subsequently heat to torque in a standard combustion engine, then this guy has invented a rather shitty and inefficient Tesla.

Selected quotes from article:

&gt;The legislation passed by Congress two weeks ago will require most food packages to carry a text label, a symbol or an electronic code readable by smartphone that indicates whether the food contains genetically modified organisms, or GMOs…

&gt; Congressional passage came over the strong objections of Vermont’s congressional delegation. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy and Rep. Peter Welch argued that the measure falls short, especially compared with the tougher labeling requirements in their state.

R1: there does not exist compelling evidence or consensus that GMOs damage humans or the environment. Mandating GE labeling necessarily implies and is fueled as a movement by one of the other.

This law comes on the heels of more than [109 nobel prize laureates (all but 10 earned their prizes in physics, chemistry or medicine)]( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/us/stop-bashing-gmo-foods-more-than-100-nobel-laureates-say.html?_r=0) urging anti-GMO activists to divert their attention elsewhere. This also comes in the wake of the [400 some odd page report from the NAS]( https://nas-sites.org/ge-crops/) concluding that there does not exist compelling evidence of damage to either humans or the environment by GMOs. The lack of substantiated concern for human safety OR the environmental impact may make [such a labeling requirement unconstitutional]( http://www.forbes.com/sites/omribenshahar/2016/06/01/gmo-science-and-the-constitution-vermonts-labeling-law-violates-the-first-amendment/#1a84d840342f). The scientific consensus on GMOs is resounding. [88% of AAAS fellows](http://www.pewinternet.org/interactives/public-scientists-opinion-gap/) believe that GMOs are safe to eat. 87% of these same fellows believe in anthropogenic climate change. And 89% favor the use of animals in research. 

Forgive my making this even more political, but this law reeks to me of concern trolling. It reminds me of the law that required abortion clinics to have admitting privileges to an emergency department despite the overwhelming consensus of medical professionals concluding that such a concern was unfounded. I have made the case before that labeling GMOs is analogous to forcing vaccines bottles to adorn the label, “CONTAINS CHEMICALS.” And now more than ever, I want to ask you to consider that analogy, and write to your congressman if it makes sense to you.",,,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,,,self,Obama signs bill requiring labeling of GMO foods [xposted from /r/everythingscience],,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/4vbgcs/obama_signs_bill_requiring_labeling_of_gmo_foods/,,,,self,"{'images': [{'id': '2XsWhJEXbS88f27bmUhwnnp33SvpqKFa1hfZ8WjerbY', 'resolutions': [{'height': 74, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/RXklgqeypSx25n4zGzRYRyY1qCd1NulMC3F3CvLHYVk.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=e154d79f37d73ebf6944afe2f61ba1a6', 'width': 108}, {'height': 148, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/RXklgqeypSx25n4zGzRYRyY1qCd1NulMC3F3CvLHYVk.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=0f52e4bbe3ac2144aea1c910237682d2', 'width': 216}, {'height': 220, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/RXklgqeypSx25n4zGzRYRyY1qCd1NulMC3F3CvLHYVk.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=d4cf8b923342b988007bb16eaf55119d', 'width': 320}, {'height': 440, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/RXklgqeypSx25n4zGzRYRyY1qCd1NulMC3F3CvLHYVk.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=8811e9c9c16433a069ff7bf17be5e6d0', 'width': 640}, {'height': 661, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/RXklgqeypSx25n4zGzRYRyY1qCd1NulMC3F3CvLHYVk.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=5a56c80307f148af878cdaf101b42699', 'width': 960}, {'height': 743, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/RXklgqeypSx25n4zGzRYRyY1qCd1NulMC3F3CvLHYVk.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=f4fa069af77342bbc18ea8607a9036f6', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1022, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/RXklgqeypSx25n4zGzRYRyY1qCd1NulMC3F3CvLHYVk.jpg?s=82f6c72d3417236786969db6298db7fe', 'width': 1484}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,{},,{},,,,,,,,,,1469886606.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,1457242454.0,,

It starts off with the idea that evolution and faith can be reconciled (a common position, known as theistic evolution), but very quickly moves on to attacking evolution.

R1: There's a lot of bad theology present as well, but I'll focus purely on the scientific claims the article makes.

We start off with a distinction being drawn between microevolution and macroevolution. I somewhat like the analogy that this is like drawing a distinction between jogging around the park and running a marathon: there is a difference in how we might talk about them, but the underlying process in operation is identical. Certainly the scientific consensus is, and has been for some kind, that the distinction is entirely human in origin, and that macroevolution is simply the culmination of many microevolutionary steps.^1

The article also mentions an [intelligent design (ID) proponent](http://imgur.com/iL7ef)
&gt;He also added that [universal common descent] can be reconciled to Christianity, although there are scientific problems with it.

Unfortunately the article doesn't go into what these scientific problems are. As modern ID accepts speciation, but rejects movement between higher taxa this is likely informed on the belief of the existence of a limited number of created kinds, rather than any genetic studies.

I will skip the next few pages, which are almost entirely theological, and move on the section titled ['Scientific problems with evolution'](http://imgur.com/S6HAKVZ)

We have this quote:

&gt;The current understanding of evolution fails ""to solve the fundamental problems of new information and new form -- you need new information to build new forms of life."" Scientists today cannot explain the origin of the information-rich systems like DNA which are necessary for life, nor huge events in the fossil record like the Cambrian explosion, where vast numbers of species come into existence, seemingly from nowhere.

The 'new information' concept is one that has been dealt with at length in this sub. Essential, this is the myth that mutation can only destroy information, not create it, which has been [extensively debunked](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13673-evolution-myths-mutations-can-only-destroy-information/) 

The next sentence is also a common creationist argument, and places the burden of answering the question of abiogenesis on evolution by natural selection, which it does not cover. This is a bit like arguing that special relativity is incorrect, because it doesn't explain the Big Bang. 

The Cambrian explosion is a hughely interesting event, that creationists seem to have seized on lately as it looks something like creation of life *ex nihilo*. This follows a nice trend of creationists grabbing on to ideas just as they are phasing out of mainstream scientific thought. The existence of precambrian metazoa, the fact that there was little more evolutionary diversification, the paucity of fossil record and the evolution of phylae after the Cambrian explosion have all dampened the enthusiasm for it being an incredible event of diversification, and there exist a [vast number of hypotheses](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cambrian_explosion#/Possible_causes_of_the_.E2.80.9Cexplosion.E2.80.9D) for the cause of the event. It is certainly not the mystery it was 20 years ago, although there are still questions to be answered.

The article then goes on to attack one of the great strengths of evolution: the synthesis of natural selection with Mendelian genetics to produce 'neo-Darwinism'. The article uses this to suggest that a second synthesis, that of neo-Darwinism with Intelligent Design. I wouldn't [hold your breath](http://imgur.com/gallery/BEzmacM)

Lastly, we have this beautiful misunderstanding of what science actually is:

&gt;[Science is] observation, experiment, and measurement, so conducted as to rest on the starting-point of the all-encompassing programmatic datum of God's Word.""

I'm not even sure what programmatic datum means, but even religious scientists would probably disagree with such a definition.

The badscience in the comments on the article are left as an exercise for the reader.

He's totally full of bullshit, but what really bothers me is that he claims this ""mysterious"" ability to get to the ""gestalt"" (my words) of a topic or issue. When arguing about climate change, I challenged him to show me some data that scientists are actually overstating their subjective confidence levels. He pushed back, saying that he's seen ""thousands of data points"" and he can ""just tell"" that there's something fishy going on. In general, he claims he can perform a 'survey' of data, and through an unexplainable mental process, draw connections between ""seemingly unrelated pieces of data"" that allow him to draw conclusions that other people can't see. 

Again, it's all bullshit, but he claims it falls under the discipline of ""strategy"" (apparently related to military strategy), which I can't find anything about that's actually related to what he's saying. He claims there are individuals (including himself) who have a demonstrable ability to consistently draw correct conclusions based on limited data.

My question is: does any of this crap ring a bell for anyone? Is there anywhere I can read a more eloquent take on what he's talking about?

They identify Democrat or with Clinton, and that means they are emotionally invested - she's literally a psychological extension of them. Now they have to confront persistent information flow that indicates she's probably a crook. It's little different than being called a crook themselves.

&gt;Irrationality and lashing out is the typical human reaction.

If I could have one wish for reddit, it would be people would stop thinking that they are psychologists. I am not a psychologist either, but I at least don't try to pretend I am by describing what people are going through.

R1: In the linked comment, we first have the idea that a democrat would view Clinton as a physchological extension of themselves. Psychological extension isn't a term that's widely used academically,^1 although it does have a common lay definition: treating an object as an extension of self. [Here](https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-26/edition-8/psychology-stuff-and-things) is an article where Christian Jarrett talks about how psychological extension forms from the endowment effect. One thing to note from that is that Jarrett only talks about extension to possessions, not people. This is because the effect in healthy adults doesn't it extend towards other people. In fact, the inability to form boundaries and realise that others are not an extension of the self is a key feature of narcissism. 

Aside from this point they are broadly correct. The reason people respond with anger when being presented with information that contradicts a deeply held belief with anger is because the cognitive dissonance that results causes discomfort, and reacting strongly against a source of discomfort is a natural human reaction. It's simply not necessary or true for someone to have to view the person being attacked as an extension of themselves for this dissonance to happen.



^1 (the references I could find in literature for the term were either old, from non-psychological works or used the term to mean the extension of a psychological theory into a new area).

I'm sure it's just a typo or, more correctly, written by someone that doesn't know that ""m"" means ""meters"", whereas ""mi"" means miles"". 

Where's their editor? No one caught how ridiculous this is?

Here's the paragraph...(before they fix it, assuming they fix it):

""Every year, millions of people travel to Utah to take in the beautiful and peaceful scenery in Zion National Park. According to a new study, however, the geographic stunner was formed by a massive prehistoric landslide that was far from tranquil.

The study, published Thursday in the Geological Society of America, said the park’s flat valley floor owes its creation to the collapse of a wall of Navajo Sandstone that was almost 900 miles high. Weak layers in the underlying Kayenta Formation sent debris shooting across the canyon at speeds that likely reached 90 miles per second. It's believed that the event took place around 4,800 years ago.""

https://weather.com/science/nature/news/zion-national-park-utah-collapse-landslide-massive-ancient-prehistoric-lake

The tallest thing on earth is Mauna Kea @ 10,000 meters high, 6.2 miles. So this structure that the weather channel referenced was 145 times taller! No wonder it fell. :-)

If you follow the linked study, you'll find this that they were referencing this:

""CONCLUSIONS
The flat valley floor of modern Zion Canyon owes its origin to a 286 million m3 rock avalanche at 4.8 ka arising from the catastrophic collapse of a nearly 900-m-high wall of predominantly Navajo Sandstone. ""

900 m is just over ½ mile. Much more believable than 900 miles.

http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/26/6/article/i1052-5173-26-6-4.htm

Did you catch above where they said that when this landslide occurred, it ""sent debris shooting across the canyon at speeds that likely reached 90 miles per second""?

90 miles/sec is 324,000 mph (miles per hour)! Yeah, I don't think so. That's ridiculous. That's 5 times faster than the fastest meteorite ever measured to hit earth.

http://elitedaily.com/life/fastest-things-in-the-world/1476536/

Well, the original study says ""The ensuing rock avalanche travels predominantly southeast, crossing Zion Canyon in less than 20 s with maximum velocity of 90 m/s and energetic runup on the opposite valley wall.""

90 meters/second is actually just a bit more than 201 mph (miles per hour). Much more believable.

This from someone who (alarmingly) appears to be a physics professor.

&gt;""Traditional methods like keeping onions in pockets and applying a layer of Cow Dung on the outside walls of houses absorb the harmful gamma rays,"" Uttam said. ""Cow dung, in fact, can absorb all the three rays -- alpha, beta and gamma. Among these, alpha rays cannot penetrate the layers of cloths whereas beta falls after hitting the same but the Gamma rays penetrate the body tissue and is the most harmful,"" he added. If the outer walls of houses are coated with thick layers of cow dung, it will absorb the gamma rays and in turn people would be safe, said Uttam who has worked in the ministry of science and technology and MHRD.

And here I thought people carried onions around because it was the style at the times.

While it's true that cow dung absorbs alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, this is also true of literally all baryonic matter. The walls of your house already block all alpha and beta radiation (unless the beta particles, i.e. electrons are very high energy), and [will not be able to stop much gamma radiation unless your house is built like a bunker](http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/ugrad/205/manuals/matter.pdf). Adding a layer of cow dung won't help, unless you're going to add a really really thick layer all over your house, and I don't like to imagine what that would be like in the rainy season.

What fun!

So I was reading the drug information sheet that came with my Adderall, and I read that it generally should not be prescribed to folks with a history of addiction. I thought, given that people using drugs illegally are often thoguht to be self-medicating, isn't it possible that if they were medicated appropriately, we could help those people address their problems in a safe and controlled way? I googled it, and found lots of interesting answers, but that's not what this is about. This is about the bad stuff.

The business of addiction treatment -- I'll call it Big Recovery -- is just that, a business. And as a business, driven by the profit motive, there are effective rehabilitation centers, and there are also worthless quack factories that capitalize on misery by convincing lawmakers and parents of drug users that the only path to recovery is one that parallels the Christian redemption narrative. These sorts of businesses justify the cost of their services, which are often effectively worthless, by emphasizing the near impossibility of overcoming problems with drugs and alcohol while simaltaneously always blaming relapse on the user and not their ineffective methods and philosophy. 

Now, I don't know everything there is to know about *New Life House*, but the copy on their about page sure sounds familiar:

&gt;At New Life House, we claim the prosperity of the young men who complete their stay here rather than statistics. We don’t feel we can take responsibility for someone’s relapse, and it would be misleading to take responsibility for his sobriety. This is something that sets us apart from other sober living environments, and something we pride ourselves on. Our established community boasts our success more than percentages ever will.

Wow! I mean, we got to figure out some place to send little Jimmy to get him to stop smoking pot, but why go to a place that cares about ""statistics""? And anyway, if you just don't count the people that relapse and are kicked out of *New Life House*, these people are pretty impressive!

But this about a blog post by a guy named Derek Free, ""[Should Adderall be Prescribed to an Addict?](http://www.newlifehouse.com/adderall-prescribed-addict/)"". If you know [Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines), then you know where Derek is going with this.

The bullshit starts in the lede.

&gt;In America, Adderall is abused mostly by college students and young adults. An estimated 20-30% of all college students regularly abuse the drug

I've googled this stat, and can't find any authoritative source backing it up. I think it might have been cribbed from this 2010 [HuffPo article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-ronald-ricker-and-dr-venus-nicolino/adderall-the-most-abused_b_619549.html), because there is a separate sentence remarkably similar to one Derek used in his blog post. In any case, [this 2006-2007 study](http://archive.samhsa.gov/data/2k9/adderall/adderall.htm) of college students estimates 6.4% have used Adderall at least once in *the last year*, which presumably is much higher than the percentage dealing with problems of compulsive Adderall use. While stimulant and alcohol use have significant differences, it might be helpful to note that while 71% of people drank in the last year, only [6.8% had a clinically diagnosable problem with alcohol](http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics).

&gt;Adderall itself is one of the most recent prescription drugs to become available on the black market, and calling it merely an “upper” is an understatement. The drug is made of pure amphetamine.

Sometimes I still get surprised at what information Big Recovery will spew, because they know drugs don't have a lot of defenders (more on that later), but mercy, this is just lazy journalism on Derek's part. I mean, just type the word Adderall into google. Adderall was first released in 1996, nearly two decades before the publishing of his blog post. Some of the helpless addicts enrolled at *New Life* probably are younger than the drug he calls recent. (Never mind that the medical use of stimulants like Adderall, a specific formulation of various drugs that is unequivocally not ""pure amphetamine"", predates his yellow journalism by about a century.)

&gt;Because of the sociological advertising produced by Big Pharma, many people believe now that they can diagnose themselves with almost anything. Assessing their symptoms, drawing conclusions and ultimately telling a doctor what they believe they need has become pervasive behavior in our own culture. Despite this, even a correct diagnosis is irrelevant for a drug such as Adderall. Many people skip the idea of diet and exercise, meditation practices and other holistic remedies for the ‘quick fix’.

Man, I didn't go to college, so maybe I'm not hip to the self-diagnosis scourge, but mostly it seems like people believe that drugs -- all drugs, no matter how demonstrable their benefits -- are horrible. I'm counting on a couple of comments on this thing I'm writing from people who believe that Adderall is a Big Pharma scam meant to dull our children to serve capitalism, but that comes with the territory. But the propagation of drug paranoia -- *Tweaker Madness!* -- serves a purpose, and it's Big Recovery. Instead of taking drugs (I pay twenty dollars for the consultation and ten dollars for a month's worth of medication with insurance), you can head on down to a rehabilitation center. A very lazy google reveals the right to live under constant surveillance (or, more likely, the service of hiding an embarrassing relative in such a facility) typically costs between $10,000 and $20,000 a month. Well no wonder they're so interested in people who use Adderall (and remember, all use is abuse), who are predominantly white and at college! There ain't no money in treating crackheads! (Unless, of course, you've convinced the electorate that there is no cost too high when in comes to placing occasional drug users in what are basically low-security jails.)

Anyway, as it happens, Big Pharma doesn't really have much incentive these days to move Adderall. Since it is no longer protected by patent, drug companies have moved onto new and more lucrative treatments like Vyvanse and Strattera. Ironically, both of those drugs were both marketed as a way to address ""abuse potential,"" the likeliness that someone taking the drug as directed will become dependent. (And fun fact: the getting people to continue to take ADHD medication is actually a bigger problem for psychiatrists than abuse, but whatever.) The myth of helpless addicts and our potential to become subhuman fiends after just one toke, pill, or line (who need to embark on a quest for redemption at our fine facility, as glamorized in film) is something Big Pharma has continuously got rich off. That's why companies intentionally botched Adderall IR production (which they were under contract to continue producing) right after Adderall became significantly less lucrative.

&gt; **There is no consensus** among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, gay or lesbian orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social and cultural influences on sexual orientation, **no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors.** Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation.

So, who knows, really? Well, [/u/userbrn1 does](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/4fea2e/pearl_jam_cancels_420_raleigh_nc_concert_in/d28jsft).

The idea that sexual orientation has been proven to be determined at birth and unchangeable in any way is dear to many people because in their minds, it supplies the proof that homosexuality deserves moral approbation, and by believing it firmly enough you can win the halo you were born too late to earn in the Civil Rights Movement. When it is felt necessary to give this reasoning a scientific veneer, the most popular approach is to confidently assert that science has settled on a combination of genetic and hormonal factors, pointing to studies focusing on twins and birth order.

/u/userbrn1 chooses not to mention the birth order hypothesis, which is understandable. He must have known about it, since it's discussed in the studies he cites, but after all, there is no proven biological mechanism for this effect, and anyway the samples in those studies could have been better, and [Bogaert 2003](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12635923) found a weak correlation between birth order and same-sex attraction (but not same-sex behaviour), and then again [Bogaert 2010](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-008-9398-x#/page-1) and [Frisch &amp; Hviid 2006](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17039403) and [Francis 2008](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18937128) failed to find any significant birth order effect...but of course, he can still stake everything on the genetic influence. Does his impressive list of citations prove /u/ORP7 was ""factually wrong"" to withhold agreement that sexual orientation is not a choice?

What do these studies *actually* say, anyway? The first paper cited is a survey of 198 Italian men by researchers at the University of Padua titled [""Evidence for maternally inherited factors favouring male homosexuality and promoting female fecundity""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1691850/pdf/15539346.pdf). The authors do not seem to think their research is the silver bullet /u/userbrn1 believes it to be:

&gt; Finally, we emphasize that over 79% of the variance in male sexual orientation in our sample remains unaccounted for by the factors of an excess of maternal homosexual kin and number of older brothers. This is consistent with theoretical and empirical studies, which show that individual experiences are a powerful determinant of human sexual behaviour and self-identity (Churchill 1967; Enquist *et al.* 2002; for other species, see D’Udine &amp; Alleva 1983; Hogan &amp; Bolhius 1994). Indeed, it is still possible that the higher incidence of homosexuality in the maternal line results from culturally, rather than genetically, inherited traits. In many societies, such as in northern Italy, mothers spend a lot of time with children of both sexes, especially during the early years, which are critical for the development of sexual identity and orientation (Bailey &amp; Zucker 1995; Smith *et al.* 1998). This suggests that the mother and the mother’s family could be the preferential source of some of a child’s behaviour and attitudes (Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman 1981; Cavalli-Sforza *et al.* 1982), including traits relevant to the child’s future sexual preferences and behaviour. One may also speculate about co-evolution between genes and culture (Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman 1981; Boyd &amp; Richerson 1985; Laland *et al.* 1995). For instance, a genetic mutation with the characteristics described above may not be advantageous when fecundity is high and limited only by the availability of resources, as in most traditional societies, but may spread more readily if fecundity is low and resources plentiful, as found in industrialized societies, such as Italy.

That's OK though, since [""A linkage between DNA markers on the X chromosome and male sexual orientation""](http://postcog.ucd.ie/files/2881563.pdf) said ""the same thing,"" didn't it? Well, no, actually that study's authors explicitly noted that their results were hard to reconcile with the model proposed by this one:

&gt; The existence of X-linked genetic factors associated with male homosexuality has been suggested previously from DNA-linkage analysis of homosexual brothers (**Hamer *et al.* 1993**; Hamer &amp; Copeland 1995; for dissenting views, see Risch et al. 1993; Rice *et al.* 1999). The model, however, faces another difficulty. Based on our data, the X-linked allele should substantially enhance female fecundity, while being, at most, slightly detrimental to overall male fecundity (note that, in table 2, the fecundity of maternal uncles of homosexuals is not depressed, despite the fact that five of these individuals were childless homosexuals or bisexuals). The model would, thus, predict that the allele is very common (Rice 1998), whereas homosexuality is uncommon (Kinsey *et al.* 1948; Whitam *et al.* 1993; Hamer &amp; Copeland 1995; Barbaglio &amp; Colombo 2001).

What does Hamer *et al.* 1993 have to say about the decisiveness of its findings, anyway?

&gt; At present, we can say nothing about the fraction of all instances of male homosexuality that are related or unrelated to the Xq28 candidate locus because of the selection for genetically loaded families that is imposed by linkage methods. We also have no information about the role, or lack thereof, of the Xq28 region in multiplex families containing multiple gay men or lesbians (or both) (29), nor about the presence or absence of the homosexuality-associated allele in brothers or other male relatives who identify as heterosexual. Given the overall complexity of human sexuality, it is not surprising that a single genetic locus does not account for all of the observed variability. Sib-pairs that are discordant at Xq28 should provide a useful resource for identifying additional genes or environmental, experiential, or cultural factors (or some combination of these) that influence the development of male sexual orientation.

So far, our hero has chosen two studies, one of which is critical of the other, and neither claims to explain the sexual orientation of all or most gay men to the exclusion of other factors.

What about the three studies he cites involving brain structure? [LeVay 1991](http://postcog.ucd.ie/files/sciencearticle.pdf) disclaims discovery of a biological *cause* of homosexuality:

&gt; The discovery that a nucleus differs in size between heterosexual and homosexual men illustrates that sexual orientation in humans is amenable to study at the biological level, and this discovery opens the door to studies of neurotransmitters or receptors that might be involved in regulating this aspect of personality. Further interpretation of the results of this study must be considered speculative. In particular, the results do not allow one to decide if the size of INAH 3 in an individual is the cause or consequence of that individual's sexual orientation, or if the size of INAH 3 and sexual orientation co-vary under the influence of some third, unidentified variable.

Another study saying [it proves nothing](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/06/13/0801566105.full.pdf).

&gt; The present study does not allow narrowing of potential explanations, which are probably multifactorial, including interplay between pre- and postnatal testosterone and estrogen, the androgen and estrogen receptors, and the testosterone-degrading enzyme aromatase.

[Allen &amp; Gorski 1993](http://www.pnas.org/content/89/15/7199.full.pdf) suggests a possible avenue for future research.

&gt; It is unknown at what period in life sex- and sexual orientation-related differences in the AC develop. ... However, knowledge of the time course of the establishment of structural sex differences in the human brain and the study of individuals exposed to atypical hormonal environments may be useful in identifying causal factors of homosexuality.

At this point, /u/userbrn1 sees fit to cite a twin study, [Whitam *et al.* 1993](http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/1961to1999/1993-homosexual-orientation-in-twins.html). For readers who may not be familiar with the concept, there are two kinds of twins, monozygotic (or identical) twins who share all of their DNA and dizygotic (or fraternal) twins whose DNA is no more similar than any other pair of siblings. If the more genetic material twins share, the more likely they are to share a sexual orientation, that strongly points to a genetic influence on sexual orientation.

One of the first efforts to prove homosexuality is not a choice was [Kallmann 1952](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1716443/pdf/ajhg00421-0084.pdf), which allegedly found that 10% of gay fraternal twins had a twin who was also gay, but in the case of gay identical twins, the other twin was *always* gay, or at least bisexual. Subsequent research has largely failed to replicate this dramatic result, but studies like this one in the 1980s and 1990s did find some statistically significant results, and if you ignore the 29.4% of gay men in this study whose identical twin was straight, even ""scientific evidence clear as day."" The authors, however, are more circumspect. They suggest several possible explanations for their data other than a ""gay gene,"" including the influence of one's social environment as a causal factor of sexual orientation, and conclude:

&gt; It is clear that the question of nature vs. nurture remains only partially answered by the present study. If Kallmann’s and Schlegel’s near 100% high rates of concordance for MZ twins had been confirmed, the issue would be far more clear-cut. We are left then with the conclusion that biological factors are strongly operating in the determination of sexual orientation with the precise nature of these factors yet to be understood.

But then, the sample in Whitam *et al.* 1993 was not ideal, since the subjects were recruited through an advertisement. When [Bailey *et al.* 2000](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/JMichael-Bailey/Publications/Bailey%20et%20al.%20twins,2000.pdf) randomly sampled a twin registry, monozygotic concordance fell to only 20%, failing to reach statistical significance:

&gt; This suggests that concordances from prior studies were inflated because of concordance-dependent ascertainment bias (Kendler &amp; Eaves, 1989). In those studies, twins deciding whether to participate in a study clearly related to homosexuality probably considered the sexual orientation of their co-twins before agreeing to participate. In contrast, both the more general focus of our study (i.e., on sexuality in general) and its anonymous response format made such considerations less likely.

[Långström *et al.* 2010](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5320571_Genetic_and_Environmental_Effects_on_Same-sex_Sexual_Behavior_A_Population_Study_of_Twins_in_Sweden) was even less impressive: out of 71 twin pairs where one twin was gay, in only 7 was the co-twin also gay.

Finally, the pièce de résistance, ""a very VERY thorough research project by the American Psychological Association declaring that gay conversion therapy is entirely ineffective."" What the APA actually says about sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE) is this:

&gt; There are no studies of adequate scientific rigor to conclude whether or not recent SOCE do or do not work to change a person’s sexual orientation.

We are also told the APA said: ""It also leads to significantly higher rates of suicides for people enrolled in such programs."" What they actually said was:

&gt; Although sound data on the safety of SOCE are extremely limited, some individuals reported being harmed by SOCE. Distress and depression were exacerbated. Belief in the hope of sexual orientation change followed by the failure of the treatment was identified as a significant cause of distress and negative self-image (Beckstead &amp; Morrow, 2004; Shidlo &amp; Schroeder, 2002).",,,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,,,self,"Everyone knows sexual orientation is fixed by fate, just look at these seven sources that don't say so.",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/4flev1/everyone_knows_sexual_orientation_is_fixed_by/,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,1367879174.0,,

* If the Earth spins at 1000 mph, how can you fly in a plane?

^Note: I am paraphrasing.

######Explanation

I won't explain all of these, because some are too broad (""evolution isn't real""), and some I don't know how to explain (the Antarctica one).

&gt;The Earth spins at 1000 mph, so how can you fly in a plane?

Motion is relative. The atmosphere, as well as our planes, spin with the Earth. If you get in a car and drive down the highway, then hold a ball to your side and drop it, it doesn't smash through your back window. It falls down by your side because it is moving forward at the same speed as your car. Planes in the air are also moving at the same speed as the Earth (plus or minus their actual relative velocities).

&gt;If the sun was as far away as they say it is, then the light would come in parallel

As far as I know, light does come in nearly parallel. I don't know where he got this from.

&gt;The sun, moon, and stars are all part of a dome around the Earth.

Ummm... no. People have left the Earth and landed on the moon.

&gt;If the Earth was spinning, then the stars would be moving!

The stars *do* move. If you don't look carefully, you won't notice, but if you go outside and watch them against some landmark, you can see them move over the course of the night.

&gt;There are no pictures of the Earth from space.

&gt; I think I have a lot of experience on this because I've had my period on a [sad?] diet, on a raw vegan diet, on a vegan diet

You aren't a menstruation expert just because you eat food. An expert on menstruation would be a gynecologist.

&gt; As soon as I came onto [a raw vegan diet], like within the first month, I lost my period.

I hope she went to a doctor. Amenorrhea can be serious and may involve failure of the ovaries or pituitary. It's probably malnourishment from eating only fruit, though.

&gt; I was so excited to get rid of it.

If you unexpectedly lose your period at a young age without getting pregnant, don't celebrate. See a gynecologist.

&gt; Heavy period, pain, discomfort, depression associated with … eating animal products, and I'm eating junk food.

No, eating meat doesn't cause menstrual pain or depression.

&gt; High fat vegan food, and my period came back.

Congratulations, your amenorrhea was only caused by malnutrition, and you solved it by eating from multiple food groups again!

&gt; [Something about changing birth control possibly causing the menstrual changes]

&gt; And I went back onto 100% raw vegan, and it came back lightly.

If you recently switched hormonal birth control medication, fluctuating uterine bleeding is to be expected. Don't pin it on diet.

&gt; So initially it was heavy from the high fat, and then it went light.

Yeah, because you aren't eating enough.

&gt; So I was only having period for like three days! And that's how it was for years and years and years!

Sounds like you simply finished puberty. Three-day periods are pretty normal.

&gt; So going back to why I lost my period in the first place…

I'm actually totally confused about the order of events in this story so far.

&gt; Taking a contraceptive pill for seven years … so my hormonal levels were quite crazy

Did you not take them as instructed?

&gt; When I took out the dairy and the junk food, my body finally had the energy, the vitality, to start cleaning house, to start balancing out my hormones.

Amenorrhea is in no way the ""balancing of hormones"". In fact, it can be caused by unbalanced sex hormones from defective hypothalamus or pituitary glands.

&gt; And a lot of people are like, ""oh but that's unhealthy"", ""no no no"", ""you need your period"", ""that's terrible"". Well is it?

Yes.

&gt; Well, a lot of people don't know.

Gynecologists are 100% sure of what menstruation is.

&gt; All I can go on are my instincts and my feeling at the time.

Or the advice of your OB/GYN…

&gt; At the time, I think it needed to happen for my body to balance out.

What does that even mean?

&gt; One thing that is really really important if you do lose your period: are you still ovulating?

No.

&gt; Instinctively, I felt like I was still ovulating because I felt so good.

You get two options:

* Ovulate and get a period

* Don't ovulate and be liberated from menstruation

You can't be fertile without getting rid of unfertilized eggs and unused endometrium lining. Where are all these unfertilized eggs going? Are they just building up in the uterus like anti-contraception legislators seem to think?

&gt; If it's so unhealthy to go through [surprise amenorrhea], then why did I feel so amazing?

It's not necessarily unhealthy, as many women on hormonal birth control do lose their periods, but veganism isn't hormonal birth control.

&gt; So is it healthy long-term to not have a period?

Amenorrhea is a symptom and neither healthy nor unhealthy. If it's a side effect of hormonal birth control, then yes. If it's from malnourishment or endocrine disruption, then definitely not.

&gt; There's a lot of different opinions on this.

No there aren't.

&gt; I still believe that largely, menstruation is toxicity leaving the body.

No.

&gt; A lot of people are having heavy heavy periods … because they have a toxic body or have a toxic diet.

They would be dead.

&gt; If you have a high-fat diet, then your menstruation is going to be … more painful

If he wins (which I doubt but who knows with this place) then I will be opting out membership of the union. I don't want it to appear as though someone who is apparently scientifically illiterate is representing me as a student. 

This story happened back last summer when the NHS decided to stop offering homeopathic medicine and [I wrote an article](http://theknowledgeplymouth.co.uk/homeopathy-is-pseudo-scientific-nonsense/) about it saying how it was about time and how I believe students have a responsibility to communicate the evidence we know about pseudo-scientific nonsense. 

[This guy wrote a response article a week later](http://theknowledgeplymouth.co.uk/homeopathy-is-beyond-the-understanding-of-science/) and the whole thing is terribly bad. [I wrote a kind responsey thing on my own blog](https://unwelfarestate.wordpress.com/2015/08/20/how-do-we-develop-scientific-knowledge/) but it was mostly a writing exercise and probably extremely boring unless you feel like brushing up on the most basic philosophy of science / research methods. 

The badscience perp begins thusly:

&gt;I have been called many things in my time; but never have I been accused of believing in something that has no scientific evidence. Unless you count that I’m a Christian, but that’s an entirely different matter altogether, and one I’ll completely ignore for now.

It only took a sentence for this one to start contradicting themselves but even I can't stand militant nu-atheist types so I'll leave that alone- I don't believe being a Christian means we can assume anything about one's intellectual ability. 

&gt;I am referring to the recent article written by Opinion writer Tom Feynman, that attempts to debunk Homeopathy. I fail to see how believing in something that works for you, that helps you become better (physically or mentally), is a bad thing. Homeopathy works for many people. Many of my friends use it as an initial treatment, and it works.

Firstly, I didn't try to debunk homeopathy. Secondly, homeopathy just doesn't work for many people and references to anecdotal evidence are bad science. 

&gt;The previous article stated that many studies have looked into Homeopathy, and they have all said that it’s no better that a placebo. Could it be at all possible that the people funding these studies have links to Pharmaceutical Companies? If you said no, then you’re kidding yourself. It’s entirely possible, thereby entirely possible the results could have been fixed. Please don’t misunderstand me, I’m not stating that as fact, just pointing out the reasonable, logical possibility, no matter how small a possibility it might be.

From my own response article:

&gt;&gt;Concerning the latter claim I would like to make absolutely clear that I am aware of the massive problems arising from conflicts of interest within pharmacology. Taking an example which is close to my heart, that I have been trying to raise awareness of in my personal and academic life, is the corruption of psychopharmacology by big pharma. This topic is something I would like to write about in more depth but suffice to say, there is mounting evidence to support the idea that antidepressants don’t work (See [“The Emperor’s New Drugs: Exploding The Antidepressant Myth” by Dr Irving Kirsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Drugs) for an easy to read argument without too much jargon, I will include references to peer-reviewed journals in the full article to be written in future). Obviously, this is a touchy subject for many with anecdotal evidence, just like those with evidence supporting the efficacy of homeopathic medicines, but we must keep in mind that we are all susceptible to biases that inhibit our ability to remain objective and impartial.

Scientific illiterati continues:

&gt;What wasn’t mentioned were the case studies that have shown Homeopathy works.

&gt;The son of a friend of mine was suffering from Stage 4 liver cancer. As far as I’m aware, he hadn’t had any chemo or radiotherapy for a couple of weeks, as it wasn’t doing anything to shrink the tumor. His mother, my friend, started him on Homeopathy, and he has been in remission ever since.

&gt;I haven’t had any ‘real’ medication for depression since having a Homeopathic treatment.  Before that, I was on 20mg a day (it doesn’t sound a lot, but it’s the average dose).

I wonder what other conspiracies this guy is into after reading that story. Does he really not believe that the media wouldn't pick up such a story and make it massive? That big pharma wouldn't be pouring money into investigating and investing in homeopathic remedies if it was true? 

Also, 20mg of what? And ""it doesn't sound like a lot"" from someone advocating homeopathy it sounds like a heck of a lot!

&gt;Whether or not it’s no better than a placebo is a moot point. If it works, then it works. The reasons behind it might be beyond science’s current ability to understand. I doubted it before I had it, my friend (who I mentioned earlier) suggested it to me, and I tried it; it worked for me. It may work for you. Don’t get me wrong, it’s probably not going to magically heal a broken bone, but it may aid the healing process.

&gt;All I ask is that you don’t knock it until you try it. If we believed everything negative we read all the time, in my life-time several asteroids should have hit earth, the Mayan Calendar should have heralded the end of the world, the Millennium Bug should have destroyed everything electronic, and Sepp Blater could have been FIFA President until 2576. I’d go mad if I believed every little bit of negativity in the world.

*bangs head against the wall* please please no, I just managed to quit drinking again. 

&gt;If you read something positive about a subject, don’t dismiss it just because it’s easier for you to believe the negativity that is projected about it especially if the understanding of the subject is limited. A positive is a positive. It may not be your experience, but it is still experience. The amount of times I’ve been proven wrong about something by just trying it one more time…

I wonder if he would apply that logic to illicit drugs? There is a hell of a lot of negativity about such things and yet [I have also written about](https://unwelfarestate.wordpress.com/2015/07/05/31/) [how UK drug policy doesn't follow from the evidence](https://unwelfarestate.wordpress.com/2015/07/08/call-for-regulation-rather-than-criminalisation/) it is supposed to be based on. 

&gt;The theory behind why Homeopathy works is sound: there’s a chemical imbalance within our bodies, and solving that imbalance solves the issue. It may take two, three, four, or maybe even 20 visits to get things completely right, as there may be underlying causes to each level of imbalance. The bit science cannot explain, I think, is how it works. That is the bit that is beyond the understanding of science.

That theory is the same questionable theory used to support the current way we treat things like depression which I am sceptical about after reading aforementioned work by Kirsch and other things like Peter Conrad's work on medicalisation and James Davies' anthropological work on psychiatry. 

&gt;If it works for someone, then it works. It may not work for everyone, every time, but that’s the same with modern medicine. It worked for me, though, and people I know.

&gt;Give it a go, I did.

It's true that trying to find universals in human culture is no trivial task (unless you aim for trivial conclusions like ""Every society has language and sexual reproduction!"") and there's a huge amount of cultural variation within humankind. That does not, however, lead to the conclusion that modern mathematical tools like calculus were in practical use ~4500 years ago. If calculus were in fact in use back then, it was certainly forgotten by the time of the ancient Greeks, or Zeno's paradoxes wouldn't have been at all noteworthy except as pedagogical devices for introducing students to the idea of infinitesimal calculus. They *certainly* wouldn't have been using the [method of exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion) if they had fully-developed calculus to work with.

Let's get to the Pyramids themselves. For starters, consider the fact that they're made out of layers of rectangular blocks, and their layout generally involves a square base. Calculus, for example a volume integral, is most useful when the shape you're considering is curved. It's pretty fucking superfluous when you're working with rectangles and triangles. Even for volume, you don't have to use calculus to get the volume of a pyramid. Euclid, the great Greek geometer, in fact arrived at the correct formula for the volume of a cone or pyramid (one third of the area of the base, multiplied by the vertical height) using the method of exhaustion. There are other ways to calculate the volume of a pyramid; for example you can [slice up a cube along its diagonals to form six identical pyramids](http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/QQ/database/QQ.02.06/becky1.html); from there it is possible to generalize to pyramids of other height/base ratios.

So what do they even need calculus for in order to build the Pyramids? It's not at all clear. It's not as though the Egyptians were inexperienced in either geometry or pyramid-building--quite the opposite. Their construction techniques had developed significantly in the century or so between the construction of the earliest extant pyramid, the stepped [Pyramid of Djoser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Djoser) and the Great Pyramid of Giza, an indication that practical experience in geometry and engineering comes in handy for such an undertaking.

**Update:** OP has provided additional sources which actually reinforce the wrongness of his point. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_calculus#Ancient

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Mathematical_Papyrus

The third source actually shows explicitly that the Egyptians knew how to calculate not only the volume of a pyramid, but the *frustum* of a pyramid--essentially a pyramid with the top cut off. There are a variety of ways this could be derived, but no evidence that they used calculus to work it out. All of the sources agree that there was no calculus being used in ancient Egypt, although like many societies they developed some mathematical ideas that would eventually form part of the basis of calculus, as well as approximation techniques like the method of exhaustion.",,,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,,,self,In which we learn that calculus was used to build the Pyramids,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/47nw9y/in_which_we_learn_that_calculus_was_used_to_build/,,,,self,"{'images': [{'id': 'ZZAb6AsPN7g3Z5JslpykWxTFBEj8k9j8g4NOkywqiwE', 'resolutions': [{'height': 185, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/ouIDOxnrLxPislylj-qxPhK_DRf471ECE_zNBChPOWk.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=3a1ffae56c43a6615911673ba6fc79c0', 'width': 108}], 'source': {'height': 257, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/ouIDOxnrLxPislylj-qxPhK_DRf471ECE_zNBChPOWk.jpg?s=7d814ee1bb9731449262a654b7ec633e', 'width': 150}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,{},,{},,,,,,,,,,1456516595.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,1351809770.0,,

Can't make this stuff up

&gt; Assuming relativity, from one perspective the arrow is actually travelling backwards (but the world is also travelling backwards but faster.) So, if the tree slowed down to conserve momentum in that reference frame then the tree would actually appear to speed up from your reference frame which is silly.

&gt; I think that what would actually happen is some kind of time dilation or spaghettification effect.

Regarding his science:

We'll get back to invoking relativity later, but to start things off - time dilation is a phenomenon that is experienced by all objects in relation to other objects, and is negligible at all but the highest of velocities which are not relevant here. And even if they were, there would be no 'time dilation effect' as there is no such thing - unless he means the change in the flow of time for the arrow in relation to other objects after experiencing a change in velocity, but that would be extremely redundant.

Spaghettification is a phenomenon caused by an extreme non-homogeneous gravitational field, and has absolutely nothing to do with momentum, relativity, or time dilation.

As for relativity, he's right that it wouldn't make sense. The problem is that conservation of momentum isn't applicable, and nothing is because the scenario is impossible and absurd. The final reason why this is bad science, is [simply because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzlK0OGpIRs&amp;t=13)...

Most of the arguments are fine, except that he apparently argues that the moon's ability to reflect sunlight still does not let us set stuff on fire because the moon's surface is not on fire.

It is easy to see intuitively that this is wrong because mirrors used in solar ovens do not always get as hot as the oven itself. However, if you didn't know that, I did some math for you. I will redirect you to [this pdf](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/0471791598.app1/asset/app1.pdf;jsessionid=441C39C0588A214E4F258FB3584DF82D.f03t04?v=1&amp;t=ikgx273i&amp;s=ec48e67128e22bbf1919ffcacac7e31b79af2e5a&amp;systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+27th+February+from+09%3A00-14%3A00+GMT+%2F+04%3A00-09%3A00+EST+%2F+17%3A00-22%3A00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience.) as a source for much of the math so this post doesn't look *too* silly.

-------------------------------

Consider [this setup](http://ronja.twibright.com/drawings/focal_distance.png). Something similar can be done with a mirror, but this is easier to do math with. The power absorbed by an object seeing an incident wave front is dB\*dA\*dO, where dA is the emitter area, dB is the receiver area, and dO is the (reciprocal) solid angle seen between the two. The typical 1/r^2 dependence is buried in that dO term. Because we are talking about [black bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation), we really care about [intensity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics\)) (defined the common way, optics can have a different definition that we will not be using) where I = Power / Area. In our case, Area = dB so the intensity our object sees is dA\*dO.

From the PDF I linked, it is easy to see that the maximum intensity we can give our object is dO = 2pi steradians (covering the entire half-sphere). This would effectively return our object to the surface of the source, eliminating all 1/r^2 contributions. This is the limit of what lenses can do.

But what if our lens absorbs? This appears to be key to Monroe's argument. His argument appears to be that an absorbing lens should be the same temperature or close to the same temperature as the source. This is construct a thought-experiment for. We know the equilibrium temperature of a black body lens is just input power / area. But notice that a perfect lens makes distance irrelevant. The size of the source and the object depend only on the ratio of focal length to distance, so I can adjust the focal length to match my desired distances, but the size of the lens depends linearly with distance independent of focal length. This is a free parameter in the system, so I can make it as big as I want. Thus, the intensity seen by the lens (power absorbed/area) can be made arbitrarily small and thus the lens arbitrarily cold. In fact, the way I do this is by placing my lens as close to the object I am trying to heat as possible. The moon is much closer to us than the sun, so we can do this no problem.

But what about the lens absorbing too much intensity and reducing its output? Also easy to incorporate. The intensity seen by our object simply becomes I = k\*dA\*dO, for some k &lt; 1. The moon's k is actually a very low 0.12. However, using our good friend the Stefan-Boltzmann law, this makes the apparent temperature of the source k^(1/4)T_s, or about 0.74\*the sun's surface temperature - still hot enough to burn most things.

-------------------------------

In short, the reflection argument for using moonlight COULD work. It doesn't because it turns out the moon is a bad mirror (it makes the dO term in dA\*dO larger without focusing to a point, so a downstream lens has less dO and less dA to work with). But we could build a mirror where the moon is that let us do this. Whether or not Buzz Aldrin burned up on the moon is irrelevant.

I am a big fan of What-ifs in general, but Monroe does oversimplify sometimes. This simplification made an explanation incorrect.

A plan to relieve rush hour traffic in Los Angeles with a new alternate route through asteroid Tsiolkovsky-Tchaikovsky-Bowie has been received with cautious optimism by traffic engineers, volcanologists, and space travel enthusiasts.

Dubbed the ""Asteridge"" or ""Asbridge"", the proposal calls for first shipping compact and economy cars (only) from Long Beach, California to Guayaquil, Ecuador; then from Guayaquil, via special cog railway, to the summit of Chimborazo, the point on Earth farthest from the Earth's center and, being also only one and a half degress from the equator, a favorable ""slingshot"" spot for launching eastward into low earth orbit. Nuclear rockets and solar wind sails would be used to complete the outward journey to the asteroid belt. 

Uber and Lyft Freight has placed a bid to handle the return haul using an interplanetary train assembled from its supply of surplus oxygen bottles, army transport trucks, and F-35 fighter jets.

Chin Hu Brin, a billionaire coal broker, tango instuctor, and astrophysicist has pledged $250M if the State of California and the Federal Government each agree to match this amount to cover the cost of an initial feasibility study which will be refereed by Richard Branson, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and cast members from The Big Bang Theory. Lauren Muffet, head of Citizens Against Crony Capitalist Billionaires, challenged the Hu Brin plan, however, noting that ""there are more than enough legitimate billionaires nowadays to fund such a venture privately.""

Supporters also called attention to the decreasing differential downside risk such a project could bring to overlapping (""piggyback""(1)) and mission-critical-resource target of opportunity (""bootstrap""(2)) projects. Tsiolkovsky-Tchaikovsky-Bowie, for example, is believed to be rich in platinum, a catalyst critical to both petroleum cracking and auto emissions control. 

Space tourism revenues and weightless sex therapy fees would boost the project's prospects for long-term profitability.

Because of microchimerism (semen/fetus' genome affecting her own genome permanently) she has been turned into a non-white that still looks like a white, which is deadly in regards to preserving the purity of our race.

&gt;When a man miscegenates he just injects white seed into a more primitive/lesser/foreign creature creating a mongrel, which is disgusting. But it is no loss to the white race, it simply creates a hazard (half non-white that is more capable of miscegenating than a full, but not as much as a mudshark).

&gt;Very important distinction to be made. Male miscegenation is just gross/degenerate/breeds nons/spreads disease, but female miscegenation is death. The fact that men miscegenate more is because men are more promiscious and less selective with partners, but even so it doesn't harm our race nearly as much.

R1. It's unclear what his point is, but it looks like he's trying to equivocate inductive reasoning and racism. Inductive reasoning does not involve taking a small sample size and generalizing from that sample, the characteristics of a whole population.

Their idea appears to be using renewable energy sources to mine bitcoin, with the waste energy from the mining process either stored in non-heat form or rejected out into space.

R1: Lots of things wrong with the ideas in this post:

* They talk about how not all of the energy from the panel would be converted to heat at the miner because of transmission losses. But transmission losses typically show up as... heat.
* They also seem to think that there's a significant amount of energy that goes into a miner that isn't lost as heat. This is almost definitely false; there may be some LEDs (but the light will be absorbed by the server room walls and converted to heat), the fans will spin and produce sound (which will convert into heat), and some other sources, but I would guess that 99.9% of all the power input of any modern computer becomes heat.
* The magnitudes just don't work out. Earth's net thermal input is [240 W/m^2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_energy_budget#Incoming_radiant_energy_.28shortwave.29), meaning a total of [120 PW output](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=240+W%2Fm%5E2+*+surface+area+of+the+earth) . Global energy consumption in 2012 was [20 PWh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_energy_consumption#World_electricity_consumption_.282012.29). So if you could somehow take the entire planet's electricity output and convert it into a 100% efficient heat dump for an entire year... you'd offset about 10 minutes of solar radiation.

OP has more silly ideas [in the comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3udg0l/using_bitcoin_mining_to_cool_a_warming_planet/) on [both of their posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3ude3g/using_bitcoin_mining_to_cool_a_warming_planet/), along with people (myself and others) trying to explain why their idea is silly and can't possibly work.

&gt; In challenging the repudiations, I learned that I am actually on to something, and I will continue to pursue it. I do NOT assume that because an idea is downvoted, it is invalid.

So first of all, is this anything to be excited about? Could it make any significant or worthwhile impact on carbon emissions?

There are around 30,000 gyms in the US. If every single gym had 20 machines generating electricity, powered 24 hours a day by superhumans making 500W usable power (1-200W is more reallistic for the average person), that works out at:

600,000 machines total X 500W = 300,000,000W, or 300 megawatts of supply.

The hoover dam has an installed capacity of 2,080 megawatts, or about 7 times as much power alone. Wind power in the US produces about 200x as much power in total. So it would have little or no impact on the large scale energy industry. 

&gt;but it is environmentally friendly...at least more so than not doing these things

That's very debatable - the cost of modifying/manufacturing gym machines to generate power and wiring them up so the power they produce can be used has to be recouped during their lifetime for it to be true. The money used might be better spent on installing solar panels and other measures. 

The machines would make around 4c worth of electricity per hour with a 500w rider. 

If the machines cost a conservative $3000 to modify, install and set up, it would take 75,000 hours of use to pay them off, or 8.5 years of continuous 24/7/365 use. 75,000 hours seems like a lot of time for a piece of equipment to have to last.

And that's a very, very optimistic estimate - if the users made a more realistic 150w and the machines used for 12 hours a day, it would take around 40 years of use to pay off the initial $3000 investment.

Chances are it's a net loss of energy, or in the very best case it's likely that energy could be saved more cheaply elsewhere. 

Additionally, if people were doing this for the sake of generating electricity, rather than incidentally while getting fit, the cost of extra food production to replace the calories they burned would also have to be taken into account.

Bonus bad science from the comments:

&gt;A 0.3% improvement in efficiency is considered significant by a mechanical engineers point of view. So no, you don't need to break the laws of thermodynamics as a 96% efficiency rating is still viewed as worthwhile for improvement
...
&gt; A 3% increase in efficiency of gas turbine design results in millions of dollars in savings each year for each power station.

Why this is bad science:

Just because a 0.3% increase in energy efficiency is significant in an established, large scale project doesn't mean it is significant anywhere else. 

-------------

&gt;Who knows what may be invented in the near future because engineer ""X"" had a well-paying job at company ""ABC"" that manufactured energy harnessing bicycles.
...
Wilson Greatbatch accidentally used the wrong resistor when trying to create a contraption to record human heart beats that ended up mimicking the rhythm of the human heart, thus creating the first pacemaker. Let inventors do their thing. You never know what else might come about as someone is trying to create a ""self-perpetuating"" stairmaster.

Why this is bad science:

Someone making an unrelated discovery in an unrelated field doesn't mean that there is room for significant improvement in the mechanics of established power generation methods, or not without breaking the laws of thermodynamics. Several people in that thread hinted or suggested that potentially we could see technological advancements that would result in people generating significantly more power out than what they put in. This is contrary to the laws of physics.

&gt;The ones in Texas back in May were worse - due to the geography and sheer amount of rain, we saw flash floods raise up 20 to 40 feet in some areas with little to no warning.   


&gt;[This shows how fast the Blanco River in Wimberly, TX rose during the flash flood event - +35 feet in 3 hours](http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ewx/?n=memorial_weekend_floods_2015)


&gt;There was an article that tried to put it in perspective.  The amount of rain that had fallen on Texas would have covered the state of New York in about 14 feet of water. 

This might sound plausible if you think that New York State is the size of Connecticut. However, in reality, NY is 18% of the size of Texas, which means that if you cover NY in a certain depth of water, you could cover Texas in 18% of that depth of water. 18% of 14 feet is about 2.5 feet, or ~30 inches, and that would have to be the average for the *entire state of Texas*.

Now, it's true that Texas received quite a lot of rain this May, [breaking monthly rainfall records in a number of cities](http://www.weather.com/forecast/regional/news/plains-rain-flood-threat-wettest-may-ranking):

&gt;Texas has picked up a statewide average of 8.81 inches in May, crushing the previous record wet month of June 2004 during which a statewide average of 6.66 inches of rain fell, according to the Office of the State Climatologist at Texas A&amp;M University.

However, if you read the article, most of those records are in the 10-20 inches/month category. The [rainfall map from the article](http://dsx.weather.com//util/image/w/may2015-Plains-rain-totals.jpg?v=at&amp;w=980&amp;h=551&amp;api=7db9fe61-7414-47b5-9871-e17d87b8b6a0) shows that only a highly localized region of North Texas along the OK border was hitting in the ~30 inches range. *If* the entire state had received this level of rainfall, then it would be true that such a quantity of water, dropped at once on NY State, would cover it to 14 feet. But, of course, it didn't. In fact, most locations in Texas have *never* received 30 inches of rain in a month.

This October also saw [terrifying amounts of rain in Texas](http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2015/11/04/state-climatologist-calls-october-rains-historic/) as the remnants of Hurricane Patricia dumped on the state, but it still didn't top May's monthly total.",,,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,,,self,"""The amount of rain that had fallen on Texas [in May 2015] would have covered the state of New York in about 14 feet of water.""",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/3sb6kw/the_amount_of_rain_that_had_fallen_on_texas_in/,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,1351809770.0,,

You're not going to see 100 degrees A^(T)/100% RH in the corn belt of Iowa and Wisconsin, where the highest dew points have been recorded in the U.S. Or in Ark-La-Tex, which has the highest average dew points in the country. Or even in areas around the Persian Gulf/Red Sea (like Kuwait or Djibouti), where it's so humid in the summer, eyeglasses and windows fog up from the *inside*.

I blame the concept of relative humidity and how people misunderstand it.

What is relative humidity? Given an air parcel at a specific temperature, relative humidity measures the pressure of the water vapor within that parcel (known as the ""partial pressure"") relative to the vapor pressure of water at that temperature. 

If you have a parcel of air at 70 degrees, 100% RH means that the partial pressure of the water in an air parcel is 100% of the water vapor pressure at 70 degrees. (That is, the pressure of the water in the parcel is equal to the potential pressure of water when it turns into a gas.) When the temperature increases in an air parcel, the pressure at which water vaporizes (turns into a gas) in that parcel increases faster than the partial pressure of the water vapor in that parcel, under the Ideal Gas Law. 

This means that warmer air, more or less, has more ""potential"" to be saturated than colder air. RH is a good approximation of how ""humid"" the air is, but it's about as accurate to the ""true"" humidity as special relativity is in relation to general relativity ([watch this](https://youtu.be/IM630Z8lho8?t=51) if you don't know what I'm talking about). It also means that the idea of warmer air holding more moisture than cooler air is a metaphor at best and a misconception at worst. Dew point is a better metric, and wet bulb globe temperature is an even better metric still.

Anyway, my point is, when people say it's 100 degrees with 100% RH out, they're mixing up scenarios. RH can be 100% when it's raining, or snowing, but not when it's sunny. 

Examples:

* On July 13, 1995, during the infamous 1995 heat wave, Chicago O'Hare recorded an air temperature of 103 and a dew point of 75, resulting in at heat index of 117. Sounds extreme, right? But the RH was 41%.

* On June 29, 2012, the day of the derecho that swept through the Mid-Atlantic states, Reagan National in DC recorded an air temperature of 104 and a dew point of 69. The heat index was 111. The RH, however, was 32%.

* In Miami, on July 13, 2015 (20 years to the day from the peak of the 1995 heat wave), the A^(T)/DP split at 7am and 4pm were 79/74 and 91/73, respectively. The RH at those times were 84% and 55%.

These figures all make sense, because RH is a ratio between the pressure of water in an air parcel, and the vapor pressure at the air parcel's temperature. When the air temperature goes up, the partial pressure of water goes up, but the vapor pressure goes up faster, leading to a decreasing ratio and consequently decreasing RH.

East of the Rockies, the general RH range in summer, at least in the afternoon at the peak of the heat, is 50-65% between 80 and 90 degrees, 40-60% between 90 and 100, and 30-45% at 100 or higher. Even the 165 degree heat index in Iran this past summer (115 A^(T)/90 DP) resulted in an RH of 47.3%.

The moral of the story is, when someone talks about a temperature of 100 degrees and an RH of 100%, beat the crap out of them.",,,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,,,self,"It's not ""100 degrees with 100% humidity"", you dingus.

0:56  **Most psychiatrists would like to see me stop speaking, because I am against taking psychotic drugs, because they damage the human body**
I think he means drugs that treat psychosis, or just mental illness in general. Regardless, drugs like Chlorpromazine(Thorazine) and Haloperidol(Haldol) are drugs that we've done the testing on, and know most of their side effects and how to use them. Hell, there's even the entire field of [psychopharmacology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopharmacology) that looks exactly at the effects of psychiatric drugs on moods, thinking, and behavior. So he's only technically correct when he states that drugs harm the human body, ignoring the positive effects they have on those with mental health issues.

[Here is a study showing the efficacy of Chlorpromazine is around 60%.](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00428308)

1:47 **Why do we call it modern medicine? I don't know why we do that**

Maybe because it's based on proven results using the scientific method to use more potent and accurate medicine?

3:04 **Not a single pharmacology professor answered my question,""What is the philosophy behind it[the first-pass effect]?**

The first pass effect describes what happens as a drug enter the body. The liver metabolizes the drug, greatly reducing the amount that is left for the body to use. Now, if he philosophy in the literal sense of the word, then the question makes no sense, because the body does not have an ideology that it follows to determine how to react to drugs. My guess is that he meant ""*Why* does it happen that way.""

[Garlic may lower total cholesterol by 11-23 mg/dL if taken for more than 2 months.](http://nutritionreviews.oxfordjournals.org/content/71/5/282)

5:40 **If you think cholesterol is bad, garlic will lower it. If you think it is good, it will increase it.**

Such a comment would suggest that garlic literally acts like a placebo when it comes to cholesterol, making it no more useful than an actual sugar pill. But the study relating to cholesterol I cited above showed that garlic had a marginal increase on HDL cholesterol, so it's hard to argue that garlic will change someone's cholesterol how they want it to.

6:18 **Old ladies(85 and older) who are quite healthy are living in French nursing homes with cholesterol levels from 500 to 900 mg/dL**

NO. This is just plain wrong. I can't find any evidence that such ladies even exist. But forget that, those numbers are just too high. There are multiple types of cholesterol, LDL(low density lipoprotein, the bad cholesterol), HDL(high-density lipoprotein, the good cholestrol) and triglycerides(just another form of fat in the blood). Should your total cholesterol, that is, the sum of all your cholesterol, be higher than 240 mg/dL, this is considered a very high level of cholesterol. Even if it was all HDL, it would still be too high to be considered healthy.

9:55 **Bill Gates owns 75% of pharmaceutical companies and 100% of vaccine companies.**

This isn't even bad science, its reached the level of being not even wrong. The U.S government stopped Gates (through Microsoft) from acquiring Intel back in 1999 to prevent a monopoly in the PC market. Why would they not have acted to stop him from owning this vast amount of a market? You could argue that someone like one of the Koch brothers might be able to bribe some government official from preventing some monopoly(I have no idea if they have one), but I haven't heard of any evidence of Gates lobbying Congress to let him have a monopoly. Also, I like how he took a shot at vaccines, suggesting Gates is running them for a profit. [I briefly at the cost aspect of vaccines in one of my other posts on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/32cjwa/oh_no_teh_vaccines_r_bad_4_us/). Long story short, the cost of a vaccine makes it not that profitable, compared to surgery or treatment in the later stages of a vaccine-preventable disease.

13:07 **The body will accept medicine when taken in a natural form far better than if given in a pill.**

I'll admit ignorance on this issue, but I'd like to quote u/TheSciNerd, because he makes the point far better than I can: 
[""The first attempts at mass production of penicillin were done with large fermentation cultures of the fungus, and then the penicillin was purified out. This article was written more than 10 years after the first large scale productions for the Army. Skimming through the data, you'll notice that the peak penicillin production of a fungal culture was 2,000 units/mL at 8 hours. A normal dose of I.V. penicillin for an adult is anywhere from 2,000,000 to 24,000,000 units per day, depending on the sensitivity of the bacteria being treated. A normal course of antibiotics is 10-14 days. Do that math. So, now you know why, at least for penicillin, how the fungus itself is worthless to medicine, but mass producing one of its chemicals in a laboratory has made a global impact on human health.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinbeg/comments/1y6f6x/beg_you_know_that_weird_thing_that_you_are_too/cfivihy?context=1#cfist77)

13:28 **All modern drugs can do is cause adverse side-effects.**

You can't be serious. Most drugs used in hospitals and other places are used despite their side-effects. Why? BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THEY CAN HELP CURE A SICK PERSON WHO HAS A DISEASE.

13:36 **Death from drug side-effects is the number 1 killer in the world**

[The WHO has a list of the causes of world mortatility. Death by side-effects isn't even on the top ten list.](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/)

13:54 **4 jumbo jets worth of people die every week from drug use.**

[Ignoring how vaguely he uses drug(illicit drugs? prescription drugs?), the CDC has the American version of the aforementioned WHO list. Again, death by drugs(overdose or side-effects) doesn't make the top causes of death](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm)

15:32 **Psychiatrists have become drug-dispensing machines**

This is an interesting point. I don't know of any statistics related to how many prescriptions are given out by psychiatrists to patients. But it seems to me that the real issue here, at least in America, is that most people don't want to do therapy or whatever exercise a psychiatrist may recommend. We ask for drugs because we want a simple way to deal with the problems we have. Our time is valuable, and as we become more specialized and focused on work or money, we may feel we have no time to do therapy. This is a symptom of culture, and shouldn't reflect on the efficacy of drugs given to people.

17:07 **It is very difficult to fight for a truth in this world.**

In general, if scientists want you to stop what you are doing, it's likely because scientific consensus isn't supporting your position/action. But even scientists are human, and it's possible that the scientific establishment can act in an irrational manner, lashing out to maintain the status quo. 

21:24 **The truth is always suppressed for business.**

This isn't entirely false, cigarette companies did lie about the effects of smoking on humans. But in the context of this video, it's clear what he means: Big Pharma hides the truth about ""natural cures"" to make a profit. This is borderline conspiratorial thinking. It's the same logic people use to argue that a cure for cancer is being suppressed.

22:10 **Coconut oil is useful in curing Alzheimers**

[Snopes did a takedown of this myth.](http://www.snopes.com/medical/disease/coconutoil.asp)

22:17 **Coconut oil is useful for dealing with heart diseases.**

I can't find any evidence of consensus that this is true. I found some articles suggesting that the consumption of coconut oil is helpful for heart disease, but I'm not entirely sure. If you guys know, let me know and I'll edit the post. I'm highly sceptical of this claim. The [FDA](https://web.archive.org/web/20140201190357/http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm282425.htm), the [WHO](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43222/1/9241546727.pdf), the [U.S Health and Human Services Department](http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2010/DietaryGuidelines2010.pdf), and several other institutions advise against consuming large amounts of coconut oil because it has a lot of unsaturated fat content.

28: 55 **We can check 500 parameters of the body, and with a 5% chance of a false positive, the chance of a false positive is 2,500%**

r/badmathematics. Did he just multiply 5 by 500? I don't exactly know what a correct calculation would mean, but I think I'm right in assuring you that at the very least, any calculation would require you to use .05, not 5 in your calculation.

29:30 **This lady doctor resigned at the age of 52 because her student gave her a humorous answer to the question,""Who is a patient?""**

I highly doubt this anecdote is true, and even if it is, I doubt she resigned because of it.

29:50 **She took the MCAT again and came out 4 years later and said,""Everything we teach is wrong.""**

EVERYTHING? So you're telling me that we've built a vast amount of false scientific knowledge, but no scientist has ever challenged it and took it down. Oh, I forgot, there is a conspiracy involving all pharmaceutical companies, nearly all governments, all medical schools and institutes, and all medical researchers to suppress ""the truth"".

31:25 **Wheat is bad for you, because it has gltuen, and gluten actually perpetuates diabetes.**

This idea that gluten and wheat are bad for you pervades our culture. There seems to be the notion that gluten is bad for you, and that you should eat less carbohydrates. The [Whole Grains Council website](http://wholegrainscouncil.org/newsroom/myths-busted) explains that:

&gt;eliminating wheat will not cure diabetes or abnormal glucose tolerance. In fact, evidence continually shows that a high intake of whole grains (including whole wheat) reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes as much as 21-30%. Overeating any type of food can cause weight gain and blood glucose abnormalities, whether or not wheat is a part of your diet. The best outcomes come from following nutrition recommendations from physicians and dietitians. 

&gt;Researchers conducting a [2013 meta-analysis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24158434) of 16 studies exploring the association between whole grain intake and type 2 diabetes concluded that “a high whole grain intake, but not refined grains, is associated with reduced type 2 diabetes risk.”

For the next 10 minutes, he started talking about things that aren't bad science, so I won't cover them in this post, but the things he says make me want to face palm. Have you ever heard someone talk about how the living cell's functions and actions are proof that god runs everything that didn't annoy you?

[That's because urine therapy has no known benefit in curing disease.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032614/) In fact, consumption of urine can possibly introduce multiple strains of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains.

49:51 **An astrophysicist by the name of Robert Lanza has found evidence of the soul.**

First of all, Lanza is a medical doctor, not an astrophysicist. Second, I looked around and found that he wrote an article in [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/biocentrism/201112/does-the-soul-exist-evidence-says-yes). This article could probably warrant a bad science post in and of itself. Lanza claims that because we find lots of things that challenge our views in quantum mechanics, the soul exists. FYI, this is the same dude that created the terms ""biocentricism"", which claims that biology is the driving science of the universe. Without starting a war between physics, chemistry, and biology and their related fields, I think it's safe to say that physics would be the driving science of the universe, from the standpoint that physics can explain what happens as sub-atomic and atomic atoms interact, chemistry can describe what happens as those atoms combine, and biology can explain what happens as different molecules come together to get stuff done.

50:25 **Lanza created the notion of multiple universes., or a multiverse.**

I highly doubt that. I can't find a timeline as to when the notion of the multiverse as meaning multiple universes(the term was actually coined by philosopher Williams James, who used it as an alternative to universe to suggest an [absence of order](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=multiverse)), but I doubt Lanza coined the phrase to mean what it does today.

50:40 **Nobody has described the electron as well as the Upanishads did.**

The [Upanishads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads) are a series of Indian philosophical texts. I highly doubt that some ancient texts could describe what the electron is, when the Greeks, who created the notion of the atom, believed that the atom was the smallest unit in the universe. I believe the term *atomos*, form which atom is derived, means indivisible.


That's it. I'm done. Thank God.

What really struck me about this video is how necessary a place like r/badscience really is. This dude could fire of a false claim every 5 seconds if he wanted to, it wouldn't even be that difficult. But it took me hours to go through and look for evidence and context. It really puts things into perspective when we can make idiotic claims one right after the other, but any good claims require painstaking research and time to be correct.

And it's damanging to me, personally, as the ""activists"" delay and/or prevent research into causes and treatments.

**EDT** just to note - glossary added bottom.

One study is particularly maligned: the ""[PACE trial](http://www.pacetrial.org/)"".

As I said on the thread I will link to below:

&gt;This sort of misinformation damages patients directly (by making them reluctant to get treatment) and indirectly (by making researchers less wiling to investigate possible psychological treatments). It has, in extreme cases, [even led to death threats](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/aug/21/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-myalgic-encephalomyelitis) against researchers - some of whom have stopped their work.

The marvellous (and upvoted) response to this is a conspiracy theory which sounds a bit like a Scientology-esque aversion to psychiatry:

&gt; You sound like a shill for the BPS school. The only people I ever see referencing that Guardian story are people that don't believe ME is a real disease and wish to do damage to patients by associating them all with a few aggressive outliers. 

Yeah. Only shills for psychiatry post links to a story by reputable journalists about the harassment of researchers, despite (according to the story):

&gt; None of the scientists contacted by the Observer believed chronic fatigue syndrome was purely psychological. All thought external causes were involved. 

The cause of CFS is unknown. There are no known effective treatments which work consistently for everyone and which have long-term benefits. It's a pretty horrible situation to be in. Sufferers should be welcoming any research, and embracing anything which might relieve suffering. Are they?

Nope.

[Here is a typical thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/3gbu1n/phoenixrising_is_ridiculous_rant/ctyetl9?context=3). Note the downvotes I got and the upvotes the other posters got.

Let's examine the claims, for those who are unfamiliar with the science here. I am going to jump between users and posts to keep this all organised. Sorry if that causes any confusion.

Since CFS has no known physical cause, one school of thought is that it may be have psychological roots, or a physical cause but pshcyological factors which perpetuate it. Some therapists reported success using Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with patients. Others reported success with Graded Exercise Therapy.

What's the thing to do here? Some sort of trial seems to be in order. The first good-sized trial was the PACE study. From their [post-study FAQ](http://www.pacetrial.org/faq/faq2.html), they selected CBT because:

&gt; CBT and GET had been shown in previous small studies to be moderately effective treatments for patients with CFS. However some patient organisations had expressed concern about their safety and efficacy, and had reported that patients preferred pacing or specialist medical care. We thought it was essential to know whether the treatments were safe and which treatments were more effective.

The poster on /r/CFS opposes this finding because:
&gt; The British ME Association recently released a report on CBT and GET and concluded that both interventions in their current form should not be used as a primary intervention for this disease

[The report](http://www.meassociation.org.uk/2015/05/23959/) is surely a good scientific study, right? Right?

&gt; Our survey was launched online in May 2012 and ran until August 2012. It was open to anyone with M.E., chronic fatigue syndrome or post-viral fatigue syndrome.

Oh dear. Inherant selection bias in the sample. I'd imagine the survey got passed around every CFS anti-CBT ""activist"" forum, for a start.

&gt; The survey was split into three parts – one each for CBT, GET and Pacing – asked 228 questions in total and was completed by 1428 respondents (though not every question was completed by every respondent). 

So. Completely unsupervised, unexplained responses, then, made in a subjective manner by people who knew about the study in a non-random fashion. The results of this ""report"" are, effectively, almost valueless scientifically, but do tell us that there is a lot of concern in the community - whether or not it is founded is another question.

But yeah, apparently it overrides PACE, because PACE had such poor quality. From the PACE site:
&gt; The [PACE] trial was subject to independent scrutiny by both a Trial Steering Committee and a Data Monitoring and Ethics committee throughout, and was conducted to the highest standards. A patient charity, Action for ME, helped to design, implement and oversee the study throughout its existence.

There's a bunch more there about their methods. This is lacking from the charity's report. So obviously the charity's report wins, because it has the results we want to see. Right? 

But back to the PACE study proper. The [Therapist's Manual](http://www.pacetrial.org/docs/cbt-therapist-manual.pdf) describes the hypothesis being tested:

&gt; The aim of treatment is to change certain behaviours and cognitive factors, which are assumed to be partially responsible for perpetuating the symptoms and disability associated with CFS/ME

Note: *partially responsible* for *perpetuating* the symptoms. Seems clear, right?

Nope. Our users are not reading the same way. It's *not* a theory being tested, outlined in the preliminary documentation, it's a conclusion - outlined in the preliminary documentation. And it's claiming not ""partial"" but *complete* responsibility for the symptoms.

&gt; It's not bad information. It's pasted directly out of the 2011 PACE trial paper which I linked to [note - he clearly hadn't read my post, because I had *already quoted the exact same bit of text*]. It's their theory and the basis of their experiment. I don't give a shit if they like to doublespeak and say the opposite on their website.

Marvellous. stuff.

So why, exactly, do these conspiracists think that PACE got it so wrong with CBT?

I will quote what they say as a parent quote, and what the PACE website FAQ says one level underneath it.

&gt;&gt;There is ample evidence that CFS is not due to cognitive/behavioral responses nor is it due to deconditioning and this evidence existed during the time of this trial...

&gt;&gt; CBT and GET are promoted in the belief that patients are suffering from a psychological disorder where they falsely believe to suffer from a physical illness. 


&gt; Does the effectiveness of CBT indicate that CFS is a psychological condition? No... Pigeon-holing CFS as either physical or psychological is not helpful as many if not all illnesses have elements of both. CBT is used widely to manage many medical conditions such as arthritis, heart disease and chronic pain.

So.. they *agree* with PACE that CBT doesn't indicate a psychological cause. They disagree *because they agree*. Clear?

Next up:

&gt;&gt; It was only single blinded, non placebo controlled with no objective outcome measures and the investigators did some underhanded shit at the end by changing the definition of ""recovered"", saying that you could be recovered if you ended with a worse score than when you entered. The investigators refuse to answer if this change was made after the results were unblinded to them. 

&gt; The statistician who analysed the main results did not know which outcome data referred to which treatment, so this is unlikely. 

So one claim is untrue, and as for the others.. how *could* one use a placebo for CBT or GET? How *could* one double-blind that? ""You're going to either be getting physical exercise, therapy, or a non-active replacement (but you won't know the difference), but you're not allowed to know which you're getting, k?"" And how *can* you measure how tired somebody feels without asking them how tired they feel? Heart rate and other physical symptoms are not indicators with CFS; one feels tired but the body is functioning normaly in any way we can measure.

The report from the charity has the same problem, obviously: but they don't tell us how they tried to control for that, whereas PACE do.

&gt;&gt; The investigators of this trial and their colleagues are very much on record with their beliefs about this disease.

&gt; Pigeon-holing CFS as either physical or psychological is not helpful as many if not all illnesses have elements of both

Yes. Yes, they are.

&gt;&gt; If you take the whole of evidence available into account the results are inconclusive and the evidence in favor of CBT/GET is of low to moderate quality, as pointed out in the recent AHRQ paper.

&gt; CBT and GET had been shown in previous small studies to be moderately effective treatments for patients with CFS... We concluded that CBT and GET were more effective than APT and SMC and that the size of the effect was moderate

So.. the user agrees with PACE on this one.

&gt;&gt;  the PACE trial itself demonstrated that CBT and GET are ineffective treatments. 

&gt; More evidence was available to support the effectiveness of CBT and GET than for other treatments. However that evidence was limited to small trials, and the recommendation remained controversial. PACE is a large scale clinical trial (with 641 participants), which has provided definitive evidence of effectiveness and safety.

Nope.

&gt;&gt; They are not using [CBT] in the way it's used for cancer. The way they are using it is like saying that CBT can cure cancer...

&gt; This level of improvement is what we would expect in the treatment of other chronic disabling conditions [using CBT]... CBT is used widely to manage many medical conditions such as arthritis, heart disease and chronic pain...

No. Yeah. They are using CBT and seeing the same results as with CBT being used with other physical conditions. *Some of which they list as examples*.

There's more. There's so much more, but this post is already lengthy and I have CFS, so I have limited energy to spend on this. The thing that gets me about this is the *blatant* misrepresentation of the study and the data: users being upvoted for *explicitly stating* that they will *ignore* what the study's website says *because that contradicts what* **they believe** *the study says.*

These people are holding back the research, and scaring away researchers from investigating the chronic condition which makes me suffer all day every day. And they are doing it *by making shit up*.

These idiot are *literally* making me ill.

Thanks for listening. I will leave you with one last gem from one of the conspiritards:

&gt; You can't take the evidence from one group and just assume it's accurate.

How very true.


Glossary
--

CFS - Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (aka ME, Post Viral Fatigue). Not just fatigue. [A list of symptoms is here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_fatigue_syndrome#Symptoms), and I personally have managed to collect the whole set, including the ""other common symptoms"". Hurrah! It's like pokemon only in real life.

ME - Myalgic encephalomyelitis (another name for CFS, or possibly a condition which is now caught under the term ""CFS"").  ""Characterised by a range of neurological symptoms and signs, muscle pain with intense physical or mental exhaustion, relapses, and specific cognitive disabilities"" (from [MEResearch.org.uk](http://www.meresearch.org.uk/what-is-me/?gclid=COfStvjFpccCFWnLtAodIAUKPg))

CBT - Cognitative Behavioural Therapy. A psychologial treatment which addresses negative thoughts which result in damaging behaviour. In the case of CFS, this addresses such things as being afraid to do any physical exertion because it leads to discomfort. That degrades fitness and makes the fatigue worse.

GET - Graded Exercise Therapy. An unfit body cannot exercise a great amount. It has to get fit gradually. In addition, one sign of CFS is feeling fatigued and out of breath even when ones heart rate is normal. The body is not struggling but is flagging up that it is. Starting with exercise which doesn't cause this and then gradually increasing is the idea. One hypothesis is that the immune system is in overdrive and sees unusual exertion as a warning sign, so it ramps itself ip more: worsening the fatigue. The idea is to stay within the boundaries of that flagging by increasing gradually so that the immune system doesn't trigger and the body slowly gets fitter.

There are a couple of other acronyms but they only appear once and are pretty obvious (from the context) to refer to other treatments which were found to be less effective than CBT or GET alone, so I shall not bother to expand them as they are more or less irrelevant to the central point.",,,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,,,self,How sufferers of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome illness try to prevent research and discoveries about their own condition,,,,http://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/3gpdxd/how_sufferers_of_chronic_fatigue_syndrome_illness/,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,{},,,,,,,,,,1439451617.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,

[Here's the post in question](http://np.reddit.com/r/ReasonableFaith/comments/348kn3/evolutionary_argument_against_naturalism_eaan/):

&gt;A lion approaches a man to eat him. The man believes the lion is cuddley and the best way to pet him is to run away. The man has been selected in evolutionary terms because he survived using false beliefs.

&gt;So long as the neurology produces the correct behaviors, eating the right food, running from threat, finding water, what the subject believes is of no consequence as far as evolution is concerned. Beliefs then are very similar to the smoke coming out of a train, so long as the train moves forward, it doesn't matter what pattern the smoke takes, so long as the train parts function.


&gt;**Technical**


&gt;Let the hypothesis ""There is no God, or anything like God"" be N, let the hypothesis ""Evolution is true"" be E, and let R be ""our cognitive mechanisms, such as belief, are reliable, that is, they are right more than 50 percent of the time."" Given this, consider the following:


&gt;1.If naturalism and evolution are true, and R is not an adaptive state for an organism to be in, then for any one of our beliefs, the probability it is right is roughly .5


&gt;2.If for any of our beliefs, the probability it is right is roughly .5, then P(R|N&amp;amp;E) is much less than 1.


&gt;3.N and E are true, and R isn't an adaptive state for an organism to be in.


&gt;4.So P(R|N&amp;amp;E) is much less than 1.


&gt;**Argument Form**




&gt;If materialistic evolution is true, then it is behavior, rather than beliefs that are selected for.


&gt;If it is behavior, rather than beliefs that are selected for, then there is nothing to make our beliefs reliable.


&gt;If nothing is making our beliefs reliable, they are unreliable.


&gt;If our beliefs are unreliable, then we should not believe in materialistic evolution.

There are a bunch of reasons why this is bad science, but here's just a couple:

The argument seems to rest on the assumption that behaviours and beliefs are independent. This, of course, is clearly not true; beliefs inform behaviours. And correct beliefs are far more likely to produce evolutionarily advantageous behaviour than incorrect beliefs are; hence beliefs are selected for, albeit indirectly, in a similar way that genes are selected for indirectly.

Why is a ""reliable belief"" defined as a ""belief that has a greater than 50% chance to be true"". Most beliefs are not a binary choice between two mutually exclusive options, and even if they were there is no reason to think that the two options are equally likely.",,,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,,,self,Evolution is incompatible with Naturalism,,,,http://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/3eubpg/evolution_is_incompatible_with_naturalism/,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,1374294663.0,,

A study is posted in /r/science showing that &gt;50 times use of cannabis in adolescence is associated with a greater relative risk of unemployment, as well as a greater relative risk of receiving social welfare assistance even at lower levels (including 1-10 times used)., once confounding factors have been accounted for.

The study itself looks solid enough, although it is outside of my area of expertise, but the comments in the reddit thread even in just two hours show a completely unsurprising bais against the article.

One comment says:

&gt;So what we learned is that people who like to smoke lots of pot are more likely to end up unemployed, just like people who like to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol.
Are we surprised by this result? Did we expect anything else from people who overindulge in non-productive vices?
The old reddit chestnut applies here again: this shows correlation, not causation.

This isn't too bad, but equating an adolescent use &gt;50 times with 'lots of pot' is a bit disingenuous. No mention is made of the quantity consumed or the frequency of use. Across the teenage age range with could mean a less than monthly use. It certainly also doesn't address the raised relative risk of social welfare with 1&lt;10 uses either.

Another comment:

&gt;The tragic flaw in most of these studies is that smoking is self-reported. People, especially teens, who admit to strangers that they use drugs illegally are certainly less intelligent than their peers who have the good sense to lie.

Self-reporting is one of the only methods to assess use of illicit substances. It's less of a tragic flaw and more of a limitation in how information can be obtained. The second assertion is also completely unwarranted. Lying about use of illicit substances isn't associated with intelligence, particularly when the 'stranger' involved is in fact a medical professional.

The follow up comment:

&gt;This is what I also thought. Only stupid people (or somebody who does not care about adverse consequences) admit to taking drugs when asked by a military doctor upon recruitment. No good can come of that. An objective measure like a drug test would be more valid.

Despite that fact that this conscription rather than recruitment, thereby removing the incentive to lie, drug tests can only show recent use, and certainly not use over the period of a number of years. Unless you are doing consistent monitoring, drug tests have no place in a longitudinal study.

Another comment:

&gt; Out of my four closest friends (all born 91) three is [sic] currently on social benefits. I can however say with 90% certainty that them smoking cannabis has almost nothing to do with that.

They admit that this is an anecdote, but it is stupid to even think of assigning certainty to a relationship that you haven't statistically investigated. It also doesn't affect the conclusion of this work in the slightest.

And lastly, the conspiracy theorist:

&gt;Swedish studies on cannabis have a history of being very manipulative in how the results are interpreted afterwards. Also, Swedish studies tend to be funded by anti-cannabis groups, who order a study that give them another weapon to attack cannabis use.

Fortunately, scientists have to give their funding sources. In this case;

&gt;This study was supported by grants provided by the Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (Forte2014-0691) and by the Stockholm County Council (ALF project 20130025). 

The work was sponsored by two governmental bodies, not anti-cannabis groups. If they have an objection in how the data was interpreted, then they should probably actually pull out the bit they object to, seeing as it's all in the paper.",,,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,,,self,Study shows negative impact of cannabis?

There's been a debate in the Bitcoin community lately over something called the block size cap; the details are irrelevant^(1). What matters is [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3dszzu/55_btc_bounty_for_proof_of_block_size_debate/), where SinnyCal (I'm omitting /u/ tags here to not ping them) posts a paper claiming 'proof' (their words, not mine; we'll get back to that later) of manipulation, in an attempt at claiming [this bounty](https://twitter.com/BitcoinErrorLog/status/608623448974307328)^2 worth 5 BTC (around $1400 at the time of writing). You can see their paper [here](http://andrehaynes.me/static/AA_Reddit.pdf).

Unfortunately, their methodology is absolute garbage, and their entire enterprise was doomed from the start. The reason for this is obvious: they have no training data! There are basically no confirmed sockpuppet accounts on /r/bitcoin, and even if there were there would be so few of them that extrapolating from them would be useless. And yet they claim to have 'proof' with 'up to 85% accuracy'. How did they manage to classify something with basically no training data? As far as I can tell, they:

(*EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION*: I'm just listing their steps here, not necessarily saying that any of them were wrong.)

* Split each user's comment section in two, randomly.
* Performed feature extraction, the details of which aren't terribly relevant.
* Performed training on a test set of comment halves, using one label for when the halves come from the same user and another for when they come from different users.
* Adjusted the training parameters ~~until their performance using that model on the evaluation set matched what they wanted~~ based on their desired precision/recall. (To clarify, this is standard procedure, because higher precision generally results in less recall and vice-versa.)
* Declared that every pair of comments that the model predicted ~~were~~ had some probability of being from the same user despite not being from the same username ~~were in fact~~ were candidates for being from the same person and therefore that the two accounts ~~belong to~~ might belong to the same person.

I'm sure an actual ML expert could come in here and use words like 'supervised learning' and 'mutual entropy' and 'the' to explain better than I could, but the flaw in this seems obvious even to my relatively untrained eyes: if you have no idea what the true label for the vast majority of your data is, you can't perform classification training on it! Plus, they have 1616 users, meaning (1616\*2)^(2)/2 ~ 5,000,000 unique comment pairs. Even if they had a model with a 0.01% false positive rate for 'significant' positive and there were no sockpuppets whatsoever, that'd still result in *500* significant sockpuppet comment pairs.

Given all of this, their claim in the title of their post of 'proof', their '85% accuracy' figure (I have no clue where they got that number from) are completely unfounded. They edited in a disclaimer at the bottom of their post saying 'I am not accussing anyone of being a sockpuppet', but the vast majority of people are either going to just read the title or skim the body itself. If you're writing a report on something you did, it's absolutely your duty to try to make sure that people don't go off the deep end with their interpretation.

^1 The gist is that as it is the bitcoin network cannot even theoretically process more than 7 transactions/second due to protocol restrictions. Which is obviously completely inadequate for any kind of real financial transaction system. Everybody agrees that this needs to be fixed: the question is how? Some people argue that the size of a 'block' of transactions should be increased (currently at 1MB); since blocks occur every 10 minutes or so, doubling the block size doubles the transaction rate. Others believe this would make it too hard to run a Bitcoin transaction processor node and favor alternatives that would only use the Bitcoin network as a sort of settlement.

^2 I think the bounty is inherently bad science. They clarified elsewhere that they'd pay out for a disproof of manipulation, but it's really not clear to me how you can prove that there *isn't* a sockpuppet campaign, much like how I can't prove I'm not a secret Illuminati shill.",,,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,,,self,"How not to do machine learning, an /r/bitcoin case study.",,,,http://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/3e14j8/how_not_to_do_machine_learning_an_rbitcoin_case/,,,,self,"{'images': [{'id': 'PqhS4nIWyvAFTOfMVfPbMpt_ZbEla85NPW_kcmK_5D0', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/qnznYdZ7I-iVNsMKNqlJW-tebzAbPGlX0juF8bwduVE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=ce294bb8c89633237046feb65950ccd9', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/qnznYdZ7I-iVNsMKNqlJW-tebzAbPGlX0juF8bwduVE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=057f5ddd8f6c15aac240b4fadb021bdf', 'width': 216}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/qnznYdZ7I-iVNsMKNqlJW-tebzAbPGlX0juF8bwduVE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=e6b3ee64057c54e3ef872cd376f253d1', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 400, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/qnznYdZ7I-iVNsMKNqlJW-tebzAbPGlX0juF8bwduVE.jpg?s=edeaa368e24453d96ec237b2833dcae9', 'width': 400}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,{},,{},,,,Please see rebuttals,,,,,,1437498041.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,1388093515.0,,

&gt;Japan surrendered because we dropped two H-Bombs on them...

They were not hydrogen bombs. Nuclear weapons, yes, but Little Boy's primary explosion was achieved though using conventional explosives to fire a hollow cylindrical projectile of sub-critical mass Uranium 235 at a set of target U-235 rings to reach a critical mass and initiate a chain reaction. Fat Man employed a more complex implosive design that utilized different types of high-velocity and low-velocity conventional explosives contained in a Uranium-238 tamper, initiating a spherical shock wave that triggers a burst of neutrons from an initiator composed of Beryllium and Polonium-210 into the (mostly) Plutonium-239 pit to initiate a chain reaction that is then amplified by the inward implosion of the Uranium tamper. No fusion of hydrogen in either.

&gt;&gt;They're atomic bombs, so no

Well, in both cases the explosive energy is released through the fission or fusion of atomic nuclei. So hydrogen bombs are also 'atom bombs', though not all 'atom bombs' are hydrogen bombs. Unless there's a semantic distinction I'm not aware of.

&gt;&gt;&gt;They're hydrogen bombs due to the fusion reaction of hydrogen isotopes.

But they weren't hydrogen bombs. They were fission bombs. Some nuclear weapons did employ a fusion reaction of hydrogen isotopes to trigger a fission reaction to improve the weapon's efficiency, in turn boosting the yield from the fissile material that was wasted in earlier designs. Generally, 'h-bomb' refers to staged thermonuclear weapons that used a primary fission reaction to trigger a secondary fusion reaction, increasing the overall yield. Which Little Boy and Fat Man were not, as they had not been invented yet.

Well...that depends. Displacing oxygen with chemical weapons? Yeah, that's probably going to hurt. If you ""die horrifically"" probably depends on your definition of horrifying, some of you might have a good imagination.

But replacing your oxygen with an inert gas like helium or nitrogen? Well, you'll die, yes. Probably even quite quickly. But the thing about inert gas asphyxiation is that it can happen so quickly that you have no idea that something's wrong. You're breathing in a few times, don't get any new oxygen, your brain asks ""Hey, oxygen"", you breathe in deeper but again, no new oxygen..and...you fall unconscious. If this carries on you die. You might not even consciously realise ""Shit, I'm missing oxygen"". You just die. Nothing horrific, nothing spectacular, your brain just goes ""Whoops"" and that's that. You just died because your oxygen was displaced. Without a cough. Better luck next time.

In case you've never heard of him, Haramein is a new age guru who peddles his particular brand by pretending to do physics. Just read the first two sentences of the /r/conspiracy thread:

""All of this is revealed after new research by Nassim Haramein and the resonance project who has solved quantum gravity.
It explains the occult, it explains spirituality - it is essentially a 'middle path' for science/spirituality - and it's all got mathematical evidence. /r/holofractal[1] for more.""

I've debated these people before, but of course, it's worthless.

Haramein makes multiple mistakes, but his real trick of course is that you can rarely boil down his language into a hard claim. You need to grab ahold of one of the Haramein fanboys and interrogate a particular claim with laser precision, asking repeatedly as necessary, until you can get a concrete statement that can be evaluated against physical theory.

If and when you do finally get to a point that can be refuted (see his various followers in that thread and others), explaining why it is wrong is pointless, since his fanboys don't really understand what the words they're saying mean.

In the past I have dug through his papers and explained why what he calls a ""metric"" isn't a metric, that there are no such thing as ""plancks"", etc. I posed questions to his followers in the plainest language possible that they're unable to answer, they just drop it or move onto more gibberish.

The crux of this video revolves around the problem of squaring and cubing numbers less than 1.  The calculation they're talking about involves the square of the surface area of a droplet and the cube of its volume, all of which will inexplicably start getting smaller when it passes an arbitrarily defined unit into the (1,0] range.

So...  why not use smaller units?  _All_ of your calculations will be wrong if you use cubic kilometers but none of the data has actually been changed.  On the other hand, if you switch to cubic nanometers the square/cube problem will disappear until you get under a cubic nanometer.

Background: Nigel Short is an English chess grandmaster, currently ranked #79 in the world (#3 at his peak).  Like many chess grandmasters, some of his views are dubious at best.  Recently, he claimed that women are inherently worse at chess than men, and thus this thread.

The protagonist of our story, romancity, is invested in the idea that this is true.  It is proved, he thinks, by the fact that only one of the world's top 100 chess players is a woman.  

Others suggest that there could be other reasons for that.  Someone puts forward the view that there are so many more men than women in club or competition level chess that it is entirely unsurprising that, at the far end of the bell curve, there are more men than women. Our hero disagrees.

We start off well:

&gt; I am fond of hard data.

Well, not that well.  He doesn't actually provide any of the hard data that he is so fond of.  He does however assert, without working, that:

&gt; hint, p=0

What is this the p-value for? Who knows!  Finding out is like pulling teeth, but eventually we are told that:

&gt; Ho: Prop (men) = Prop (women), Ha: P =/= P, x = 99, n = 100, conclusion p = 0, reject Ho

Now, it's a while since I have studied stats, but this doesn't exactly demonstrate what he thinks it demonstrates.  All it shows is that it is very unlikely that a sample of 100 players having only 1 woman in would occur by chance if there were equal numbers of male and female players, and if the sample were chosen randomly.  Numbers are not some magic formula for making assertions true, as much as this guy would love it to be the case.

I then [proceeded to link to a study](http://np.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/3372kz/men_vs_women_in_chess/cqin4om) which had concluded that the number of women in elite chess was as to be expected given the massive disparity between the number of men and women at any level in chess.  Apparently this concept has been too hard for our brave hero to grasp:

&gt; Well, girls/women drop out because they don't like chess and are not as good in it.

Not only is this missing the point entirely that the gender ratio *is the same through all levels of chess*, it yet again provides no evidence for the proposition that the reason that women drop out of chess is because they are not good at it.  Yay for ""hard data""!

&gt; I see it all the time. Chess clubs with eager boys and girls. Then girls drop out. Some may be sexism, but mainly girls lose interest.

This can definitely not be explained by:

* Confirmation bias

* An unrepresentative sample (if I were a young girl at a chess club this guy was working in, I'd drop out too!)

Additionally, he knows the reason that girls drop out of his club because he has surveyed them, using experimentally rigorous methods, and has shown us his numbers and workings.  Wait, no, he hasn't done that.

Even if that were true, losing interest != being bad at something.

A prime example of an unverifiable anecdote being used to trump an actual study.

After I point out some of the problems with this, we get this gem:

&gt; and so the 100-1 ratio at the top is all sexism, boy is that good science!

Except...

1. The fuel-to-payload ratio you need to achieve a given change in velocity is [exponential in that change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation). Since Earth's escape velocity is about 4.7 times that of the moon, you'd need 110 times the fuel-to-payload ratio to leave the Earth as you would to leave the Moon with the same exhaust velocity. Hence those fuck-off giant engines on spacecraft and the tiny engines in the lander. (This isn't the whole story because of staging, but it's morally correct.)

Vaccines are not someone ""sticking a disease in your arm."" A vaccine contains something similar to the virus you are trying to protect against so that your body recognizes it as a threat and generates antibodies.

Well, considering there was a recent outbreak of measles throughout the United States (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/02/us/measles-facts.html?_r=0) it looks like contracting preventable diseases IS typical whenever idiots don't get vaccinated.

One of which is the Blaylock Wellness Report, which features Dr. Russell Blaylock. For a short summary, here's the bio from Rationalwiki:

*a prominent member of the mercury militia, having frequently written and given speeches on the dangers of vaccines and dental woo about mercury amalgam fillings. He also attacks other classic alternative medicine bogeymen like aspartame and water fluoridation. He peddles a mixture of vitamin supplements and other assorted nature woo he calls the ""Brain Repair Formula.""
Newsmax allows him to spread his blatherskite with their ""Dr. Blaylock Wellness Report"" segment, where, in addition to promoting his woo, he rails against the spectre of health care rationing and claims the Soviets were responsible for creating widespread drug usage and other health epidemics in America.*

Anyway, he recently sent out a ""report"" which claims that the drug companies are pushing for vaccinations. Normally, I leave these reports alone for my father to inundate his mind with, but with the recent rise of measles in California, which was vaccine-preventable, I had had enough. So, I thought I'd break down the various claims he makes.

**The big pharmaceutical companies have launched a new, clever strategy to guarantee sales of their growing list of vaccines.** 

He doesn't provide any proof of this, and instead compares people to cattle, following the ""herd instinct"" to get vaccinated, because apparently, they're afraid and not merely listening to scientific consensus. 

**The reason vaccines can be so profitable is that they are relatively cheap to make and pharmaceutical companies can get the government, the media, and various healthcare professionals to do their selling for them.** 

[The WHO](http://www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/financing/analyses/en/briefcase_vacproduction.pdf) actually studied the economics of vaccine creation, and had this to say.

""*Vaccine production involves high investment costs for research and development, and for production facilities. It also requires significant know-how.*""

However, it is true that the price of traditional vaccines have gone down.

""*Vaccine production costs per unit can be reduced significantly through gains in productivity (the “learning curve”) and through economies of scale. Because of the high fixed cost element, the cost of production per dose decreases with increasing batch size. The traditional six vaccines of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), measles, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, oral polio and BCG, are mature products. Because the fixed costs of production of these vaccines have been covered long ago, and because their production costs have been lowered due to the learning curve and economies of scale, their prices are relatively low.*""

However, our genius of a doctor made the point earlier that companies have a growing list of vaccines. But its not that cheap to make new vaccines.

""*High fixed costs and steep learning curve make new vaccines relatively more expensive, as the investments in R&amp;D and production facilities need to be paid off and optimum production techniques need to be perfected to bring down variable production costs.*""

In addition, consider the logic that we're being asked to accept. Even if you pay over $100 for a vaccine, how would that be more beneficial to the drug companies than having you get the disease it was meant to prevent, and having you pay more down the road?
[This website](http://antiantivax.flurf.net/costs/) compares the costs of vaccination vs. getting the disease with no protection.

**Adults will have to make up any vaccinations they've missed in their lives and begin getting regular shots each year.*8

Again, no sources cited. Where does he get this stuff?

**We are told some 36,000 people die from the flu------a wild distortion. In truth, no more than 1,000 people die nationwide from flu infections.**

*If I had a nickel for every time he makes a claim without citing a source...*

The CDC has the statistics for the number of people killed by influenza killed in [2013] (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf)(latest I could find) which state that the number of influenza deaths were estimated to be 3,679. However, that's a conservative estimate. The high end of influenza-associated deaths is around 49,000. [Here](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/us_flu-related_deaths.htm) is the CDC page that explains why the CDC has a harder time getting a precise value.

**Experts predicted that the wrong strain would spread, making the vaccine worthless, but the medical establishment still promoted it.**

No sources. Also, there is a reason its still used. [The CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/vaccineeffect.htm) explains that while you may still get the flu, the vaccine can make it milder, and that it still provided some protection against the flu strain. [The CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm) has a page explaining who should and shouldn't get the vaccine.

**An extensive study of 260,000 children under the age of 2 found that the flu vaccine had a 0% effectiveness.**

This appears to be true, here is the cited [study.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16437500)

The next part of the report lists several studies that show that the flu vaccine isn't helpful for the elderly. This is one of the rare moments where he has several valid citations to peer-reviewed journals. Here are the sources:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16876293
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17897608
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16437500

**These studies demonstrate that you are being lied to**

No, these studies demonstrate that there isn't as large a benefit for giving the elderly the flu vaccine as previously thought. You still haven't provided information to show that drug companies are trying to make lots of profit on vaccines, or that they are forcing them on us.

**There are literally dozens of carefully conducted studies from major research groups that link excessive immune stimulation with abnormal development of infants and small children's brains.**

Oh? Then why is it when I look for the cited studies, I can't find them? A search in the OMICS International shows no reference to these journals. For example, looking up the Journal of Physical Surgery, one of the citations for the claim, shows nothing. I even tried a Google search for the exact citation and I couldn't find anything. The Cellular and Molecular Biology of Autism Spectrum Disorder is some book that I don't want to buy, but doesn't appear to be a peer-reviewed journal. Likewise the ""Med Veritas"" citation leads back to the Autism Spectrum Disorder journal, and some website that says that the works of numerous scientists show that vaccines are dangerous, but that the governments of the world don't listen to the concerns. Needless to say, the evidence for the claim is scant, if not negligible.

**The pharmaceutical industry propaganda mill tries to cover up this research by implying that all vaccine opposition stems from a single article by Dr. Andrew Wakefield.**

Except if it hadn't been for [Wakefield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield), no one would be saying that no scientific consensus exists on vaccines. Wakefield's paper was shown to be false, and his articles were retracted by the journals that published them. It was also shown that he had a conflict of interest. He was working for one company to show that another company's vaccine caused autism, but the result was a dry forrest in summer for vaccine denialists. 

**Dr.Brian Hooker demonstrated that the autism rate in black children before the age of 36 months was 173% higher than those not vaccinated that early.**

Full disclosure, I don't know what the word context means. And neither does Dr. Blaylock, it seems. The article he cites was indeed published in a peer-reviewed journal, but the same journal retracted the paper, explaining,""there were undeclared competing interests on the part of the author which compromised the peer review process. Furthermore, post-publication peer review raised concerns about the validity of the methods and statistical analysis.""

http://www.translationalneurodegeneration.com/content/3/1/22

**Pregnant women shouldn't get the flu vaccine, because it can increase brain-injury in infants.**

[The very paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25634608) he cited says as their conclusion,""It is suggested that the unequivocal way to resolve the debate regarding the pandemic nature of autism is to perform an experiment: monitor the prevalence of autism after normalizing immune function in a Western population using readily available approaches that address the well-known factors underlying the immune dysfunction in that population."" I don't know what part of that he thinks supports his claim.

**Stimulating an immune reaction in a pregnant women will raise the level of immune cytokines in the baby's brain, increasing the risk of autism and schizophrenia.**

This appears to be true. Of the 6 journals he cites, I found 2 that support the claim.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19738918
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3641168/

**Using vaccines on a pregnant women show the same response as her immune system reacting to the real infection.**

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2728807/
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3964746/

Neither of the two sources appear to specifically show that vaccines cause the same response, and the 1st article says that more research is needed. Also, the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm) found that giving the vaccine to pregnant mothers reduced the chances by 92% of infants being hospitalized by the flu.

**Vaccines contain a number of brain-toxic materials, such as aluminum, MSG, mercury, and viral fragments, which are dangerous for kids.**

Searching for the citation brings up posts about chemtrails and the Illuminati.

**Old people aren't warned that getting these vaccines increases the risk of complications like Guillian-Barre Syndrome.**

Source?

**If vaccines are 99% effective, why would people oppose some people refusing to take the vaccine?**

Not everyone can take the vaccine. Having as many people vaccinated as possible lowers the chance that unvaccinated people come into contact with each other and spread the disease.

**Scientists claimed that 85% of people needed to be vaccinated for herd immunity to work, now its risen to 100%.**

Again, source? Also, the percentage appears to have stayed around [85%-90%.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity#Free_riding) for most diseases.

**0 kids have died in the last 10 years from measles, but 108 kids died from MMR vaccine complications.**

Most likely, that's because the vaccination rate was higher back then. Measles used to thought of as vanquished for a reason. Also, what's the source on the 108 kids?

**Doctors push for vaccinations because they are mislead and indoctrinated. Also, most literature they read is published by vaccine creators.**

If you're going to push for a large conspiracy to taint academia and indoctrinate the medical community, at least you could provide some sources. In addition, can Dr. Blaylock himself claim that he doesn't have a conflict of interest? He makes money off of people subscribing to the report he sends out, and the more people think doctors in the field don't know anything, he makes more money as they subscribe and get others to subscribe to his report. 

**From what proponents claim, you would think that we haven't made advances in treating and preventing many of the complication of vaccine preventable diseases.**

There are cures nowadays for such diseases, but vaccines are a cost effective preventative care tool. Also, proponents are only advocating for vaccination requirements in public settings, especially schools. But why should I care if my child happens to be unvaccinated due to my unscientific belief and ends up endangering others kids, making their parents pay for expensive treatments.

**Vitamin d3 helps the immune system, but vaccine propenents don't push for supplementation.**

That's due to the cost. A vaccine is generally a one-time thing, but supplements have a recurring cost. For example, Walgreens lists the price of a bottle of 100 vitamin D3 pill supplements(1000 I.U) at [$6.99](http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/vitamin-d/ID=361633-tier3). So, if I take one pill a day, It would cost me $25.51 each year. If you take this for say, 10 years, you would pay $255.51. And this assumes that you don't take any other supplements. Yet the original purpose was to prevent infection. If I was taking D3 to prevent measles or mumps, I would be paying [$168.47](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine-management/price-list/) for the shot. So it's in my interest to take the vaccine, rather than supplements. I'm not saying that if you have a deficiency, you shouldn't take supplements, but to substitute supplements for vaccines would cost more.

**Adults with a vitamin d3 concentration in their blood of below 25 ng/mL should take 100000 IU a day for 2 weeks, then 5000 IU a day thereafter.**

I can't find a good source on this, but the number seems far above the amount that's safe for anyone. 

That's really all there is to report, it just goes on talk about vitamin C, green tea, NAC, Plant Flavonoids, Aged Garlic extract, mixed Carotenoids, Magnesium, and Beta 1,3/1,4-glucan.Yet the most obvious takeaway should be this: Vaccines are not as dangerous as denialists make them out to be, and there is no conspiracy to force us get vaccines. It's not as profitable for companies to get us using vaccines as it is for us to have to be hospitalized. Vaccines are very useful, and I'm saddened that people try to cash in on other people's fears that science could allay. Note that I can't post the actual report due to the Fair Use Act only allowing more or less for selected quotes. That's all from me.

My original post: 

&gt; One of the darkest moment in the recent history of India is awarding Padma Shri to Mr. Mukesh Batra, CEO of Dr. Batra's. He was given this award for Medicine!!! That's right, a person practicing quackery gets a civilian award for Medicine.

&gt;Homeopathy is antithetical to medicine. Giving an award in the name of Medicine to a person who is clearly exploiting the gullible to make some money is pretty sad. It is even more frustrating that the government actually recognizes these alternate medicines and actually promotes them. Even the Health Minister thinks Homeopathy is a legitimate way to treat people and our PM wants the quacks ""to promote success stories of homeopathy."" 

The following in quotes are the offending statements alternated with my replies(edited so that it conforms to R1).

&gt; Being a person of medical field , I strongly disagree with your view on what constitutes medicine and what doesn't . Allopathy fetches money, the very thing corporates and govts are interested in , hence so heavily promoted. That being said , **I believe the human body works in mysterious ways** and unless you tap at the root cause , whether its allopathy / homeopathy / Ayurvedic / unani , it's always a symptomatic treatment . A lot of medicines we are prescribed are quite unnecessary.

9 others share this opinion. 

First of all, the term *allopathy* [was created and popularized by homeoquacks to distinguish themselves from evidence based medicine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopathic_medicine). This distinction is so pervasive in India that Medicine is divided into Allopathy and others.. where allopathy is full of side effects and the alternate is devoid of any side effects. 

By perpetuating the rhetoric of ""our body works in mysterious ways"" so many folks are giving into the incessant propaganda of these quacks.  

&gt; My brother though being a doctor himself prefers homeopathy. He feels it has fewer side effects.

FUCK me sideways. 

Another person chimes in

&gt; A few years back I was bed ridden with high fevers and symptoms of vertigo.. Almost all doctors thought it was a kidney problem, it took two doses of a homeopathic medicine to me back on my feet. A cure which three doctors couldn't figure out. It was simple indigestion. 

Yes, doctors can misdiagnose but maaaybe the person getting better is down to coincidence and not the effectiveness of the homeo ""drugs"". 

&gt; Don't rule out an entire branch of medicine **just because it isn't profitable on a corporate scale**... There are positives and negatives to everything.

&gt; treating an ailment doesnt amount to taking **chemical preparations**(preparations; **fully approved and legalized by corporate backed govt agencies**). having studied the allopathic method of medicine, it doesnt automatically exclude me from appreciating other forms that bring in relief to a patient, it doesnt automatically lead me to rally against other kinds of medicine. 

Hemopathy isn't made up of chemicals guys(to be fair, it is as close as one can get to limiting our intake of chemicals). She also probably doesn't realize that Homeopathy is a private-publi enterprise [thanks to AYUSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Ayurveda,_Yoga_and_Naturopathy,_Unani,_Siddha_and_Homoeopathy)

&gt; you see, for a person of science, isnt it unpardonable to close one's mind to ideas ? so the hubble hasnt yet found any signs of sustainable life, does it automatically mean no such life exists...?
you would be surprised at what kind of 'scientific experiments' that are conducted to test efficacy of drugs, sometimes it makes me wonder whether they are the new world Mengeles' were not they protected by people's ignorance and greedy laboratories

Hubble isn't in the orbit to look for extra terrestrial life. Oh snap! Godwin's law invoked. 

Yet another believer comes along with anecdotes. 

&gt; When I was a small kid when I I used to have severe cough, I used to have cough syrups and medicines lined up in my home on a shelf. None of those worked, but homeopathy helped. I dunno how it worked till date but it worked. Its still a mystery. When I started taking the medicine I didnot believe that it would help me coz I have tried several stuff before already. somehow it works for some ailments.

Here's the kicker, the educational qualifications of the folks who professed their allegiance to Homeopathy: 

1. Medical student
2. Ph.D in Anthropology and purveyor of anecdotes. 
3. 5 x Masters in EE
4. Masters in EE and researcher in a private Neuroscience lab and yet relies heavily on anecdotal evidence.   
5. Masters in CS and IT professional



**R1** - Homeopathy doesn't work. There is no evidence of its proclaimed efficacy.

The ""humid cold"" thing sounds dubious to me. This is because air can hold more water vapour at higher temperatures, which means that differences in humidity become more apparent when it's *warm*, not when it's cool or cold. I don't think ""humid cold"" is objectively worse, it's based on personal experience and your ability to acclimatize. Also, higher humidity levels in the winter mean your skin doesn't crack and your lips don't bleed.

When it comes to the other point. I blame the media for popularizing *relative* humidity, which changes relative to the temperature. I think dewpoint is a better metric of the amount of water vapour in the air. Take an example. On the day that the derecho hit DC in 2012 (June 29), the high temperature at Reagan National was 104 degrees with a *relative* humidity of 32%, and a dewpoint of 69 degrees. The heat index, as calculated by the NWS heat index calculator, was 112 degrees, which is pretty much death. Fast forward to July of last year, when the ""reverse polar vortex"" brought a glorious, Seattle-like summer to the midwest and east coast. At 12:52 pm on the 18th, it was 84 degrees and again a *relative* humidity of 32% Reagan National, but this time the dew point was only 51 degrees. The heat index? 82. The same *relative* humidity levels, with an 18 degree drop in dew point, and, more importantly, a *30* degree drop in heat index values.

To end with, you're not going to get ""90 degrees with 80% humidity"" unless you're in Djibouti, or on the coast of a Persian Gulf country, or something. Hell, even on July 22, 2011, which will go down in history as one of the most tropical days ever in DC, it was 102 with a DP of 78, with a heat index of 121, and the RH was *still* 47%. The worst I can think of is Dubai, where once it was 102 with a DP of 84, heat index 133 (not a typo), and an RH of 57%. In these conditions, [windows and car windshields mist up](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/4205374/Expats-in-Dubai-Shop-to-stop-dropping-as-Dubai-summer-hits-its-height.html), and Indian slaves build soccer stadiums for the World Cup.",,,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,,,default,"""Humid cold feels worse than dry cold.""

I hope that you are doing good.

I am writing to you because I’d like to ask your advice regarding my Ph.D. 

I am writing a Ph.D. in Quantum Physics &amp; HRM, where I, **based on the principles of Quantum Physics, am measuring the energetic structure of the human being, this in order to make objective and quantitative predictions about that persons skills, competences, and qualities, which can be used both in a Recruitment &amp; Selection context as well as within Talent Management, Development &amp; Spotting.**

**The idea in short**


According to Einstein the whole universe consists of energy. According to Quantum Physics there are 4 forces, which govern this energy; one of these being Electromagnetism. The famous Cambridge Professor, Stephen Hawking, writes that electromagnetism is the foundation for all of human chemistry and biology.
Based on this information I got the idea that it should be possible to measure the electromagnetic field of a human being in order to make objective, quantitative predictions about that persons skills, competences, and qualities.
I have investigated this domain; wrote my M.Sc. thesis at Copenhagen Business School about the theoretical foundation of this and concluded that it is possible to make these measurements.

**Practical application**


The actual measurements which we conduct are based on ElectroPhotonic Imaging (EPI), developed by Prof. Dr. Korotkov, which measures the energetic structure of a human being based on measuring the particles (protons, photons, electrons, etc.) which the person emits. This method has a 95% accuracy, and normal people have a 90% continuity in their energetic structure over time. In other words, this is a very precise and accurate way of obtaining knowledge about a person. 

Based on the EPI measurement we obtain different kinds of significant information about a person; for example that persons stress level as well as energy level. (I am sure that you are familiar with the expression that a person has ""a high level of energy"", nowadays we can actually measure that objectively.)
This information, about the stress and energy, is for example being applied within the Olympic teams as it has been discovered that athletes with a low level of stress and a high level of energy are ready to compete, and much more likely to obtain medals. Most likely this information can be transferred directly into for example Recruitment &amp; Selection or Talent Management, and thus give one more tool for choosing the best candidate; it can also be used to choose the best candidate to promote, etc. 

Even more important than the stress and energy level, is the fact that the ElectroPhotonic Imaging device is able to measure different electromagnetic frequency domains of the person. Each of these domains is connected with certain skills, qualities, and competences. Thus it becomes possible, objectively, to estimate for example how much ambition, will power, or drive (in theory we can measure ANY quality we wish; empathy, charisma, continuity, determination, emotional intelligence, etc.) a person has, and furthermore even to compare this objectively between two or more people in order to choose the person best fit for a job.
It can of course also be used to develop a person’s skills. At the present moment I am conducting different scientific studies with for example Mensa, an Aikido Dojo, people who practice Mindfulness, etc., about how to develop a persons qualities.

Of course there are many other practical applications of this tool.

**Future steps**


The entire theoretical foundation as well as the technical means is already taken care of. The next step will be to measure people in a specific professional context and then to superimpose their energetic structure with their KPI, or other evaluation methods, in order to make statistical predictions about the performance of different energetic structures (aka. people).

In this way enormous savings can be obtained within any kind of R&amp;S and Talent Management; both based on the resources needed to make the evaluations as well as due to the improved accuracy of the evaluations. 

I am sure that you can imagine that the practical applications of this tool are vast and diverse. It can be used to choose the right/best person for a specific job. To determine if people can work together in teams. How much energy a person will put into his/her job. How a specific person is best managed. That nobody breaks down from stress, or burns out. Etc. 

In case you know a visionary leader whom you think might be interested in me integrating this project in his/her company in order to improve HR and performance I’ll be very grateful if you’d help me get in touch with that person.

Unfortunately, there are quite a few people out there who deny climate change, mainly out of ignorance, arrogance, and vested interests. This article by the Christopher Booker of the Daily Telegraph talks about ""the biggest science scandal ever"".

According to Booker, temperature data has been processed and readings increased ""to show warming up to 1 degree C or more higher than was indicated by the data that was actually recorded."" He also states that the evidence suggests global cooling. However, the reason the data was adjusted was to accommodate for changing weather stations, changes in time of measurement in the day, and the use of new equipment. All these changes require analysis to fix holes in the data.
 
Booker goes on to talk about various minor points, which include polar bears as poster children for climate change, and about temperatures being higher in the 40s than today. The reason for that is during the 40s, we started polluting the environment by injecting large amounts of aerosols. Greenhouse gases in the air, like CO2, were contributing to global warming, but aerosols were lowering the temperature. However, we were still producing large amounts of CO2 from factories and with the burning of fossil fuels. This, according to Dr. James Hansen, led to the cooling from the 40s to the 70s.

Climate change is a serious issue and is settled science, and has withstood multiple attempts to dismiss it as a fraud or hoax. Vested interests are standing in the way of ensuring the Earth lasts for the future to make an extra dollar, and we have to act to ensure that our children don't blame us for not acting and killing them.

The whole thing is badscience from start to finish, but as a layman myself and for Rule 1 purposes, I will grab the low-hanging fruit:

&gt; If a message is written on the special film and attached to an item of audio equipment, the perceived sound can readily be changed from beneficial to adverse by merely changing the written message. To improve the perceived sound, the message should be written in Capital Letters.  

&gt; First the actual Brand name of the object.

&gt; followed by the positive &gt; **O.K.**

...

&gt; To change the perceived sound to adverse, all that is necessary is to change the message from a positive to a negative sense by changing the affirmative **O.K.** to a negative **NO.**

The concept of ""beneficial"" and ""adverse"" sounds is not defined, nor is the mechanism by which any such change would be effected explained, beyond some vague handwaving about quantum mechanics and the double-slit experiment.  Also, writing things on a piece of Saran Wrap and putting it on top of your speakers is unlikely to have a measurable effect on the acoustics of that speaker, even if you write in capital letters.

Dailybuzzlive is another of the crappy satire sites that have tried to ride the wave of The Onion's success (for the record, the only good ones are Christwire and Clickhole). Naturally, there are legions of people taking its articles seriously, a la [Literally Unbelievable](http://literallyunbelievable.org/). I'm sure I'm not the only one who's seen it crop up on newsfeeds and elsewhere. The claim basically goes as follows:

&gt;According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the *Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect*.

Just a *few* problems with this. [Jupiter and Pluto are on opposite sides of the Sun right now](http://www.solarsystemscope.com/) Pluto is located near the Sun right now (from our point of view), and Jupiter is high in the night sky. 

If this actually happened, and happened regularly (Jupiter and Pluto are roughly aligned every decade or so), our whole atmosphere would long since have floated off into space.  Besides that, neither Jupiter nor Pluto exerts enough of a gravitational force on the Earth for a human being to feel it, much less to make us weightless.

The gravitational acceleration that we feel due to Pluto at its current distance of 5 billion km is [~4 x 10^-14 m/s^(2)](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28gravitational+constant%29+%28pluto+mass%29+%2F+%285*10%5E12+meters%29%5E2), which is so small that it's actually impossible for us to detect. For comparison, normal Earth surface gravity is 9.8 m/s^(2), which is about a quadrillion times stronger. Jupiter is much stronger than Pluto but our gravitational acceleration due to it is still millions of times too weak for a human to feel, at about [2x10^(-7) m/s^(2)](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28gravitational+constant%29*%28jupiter+mass%29+%2F+%28787*10%5E9+meters%29%5E2).

Furthermore, the idea that there's anything gravitationally special about a conjunction is totally wrong. While the gravitational accelerations are additive, it doesn't make any significant difference whether they're exactly in line with each other or a few degrees apart. 

Probably worth mentioning that [**Sir Patrick Moore has been dead for two years**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Moore). This whole idea comes from a [1976 April Fools joke he made](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jovian%E2%80%93Plutonian_gravitational_effect) to spoof a [1974 pop-pseudoscience book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Jupiter-Effect-John-Gribbin/dp/0006344194), which has to make it one of the more long-lived April Fools jokes ever. The Dailybuzzlive article switched the date from 4/1 to 1/4 (or vice versa if you're European), which is at least a little bit clever. Even in 1976, though, Jupiter and Pluto were nowhere near each other. [**Hoaxes.org has a great writeup of the history of this hoax**](http://hoaxes.org/af_database/permalink/planetary_alignment_decreases_gravity/). A couple of the more amusing/alarming excerpts:

&gt;During an interview on BBC Radio 2, on the morning of April 1, 1976... Moore told listeners that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they did so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.

&gt;A Dutch woman from Utrecht said that she and her husband had floated around the room together. Another caller claimed she had been seated around a table with eleven friends and that all of them, including the table, had begun to ascend.

&gt;But not everyone was happy. One angry caller complained he had risen from the ground so rapidly that he hit his head on the ceiling, and he wanted compensation.

Regarding the book *The Jupiter Effect*:

&gt;The Jupiter Effect received extensive coverage in the media. Interest in it was heightened by the fact that its release coincided with the release of the movie Earthquake starring Charlton Heston, which depicted what might happen ""when the big one finally hits L.A."" Also, Gribbin and Plagemann weren't just random crackpots, but were actually bona fide scientists. Plagemann, 32, was an astronomer who had consulted for NASA, and Gribbin, 28, was an assistant editor at the science journal Nature.

&gt;Senator Frank E. Moss of Utah, chairman of the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, became so worried by what he read in the book that he asked NASA to check into the theory. NASA astronomers responded that while they couldn't definitively rule out that the events predicted by Gribbin and Plagemann wouldn't happen, they felt it all had a very low probability of coming true.

Pseudoscience has existed as long as science has. It hits just about every field of science. The most obvious is creationism, which people fight for to get taught in classrooms, especially in the US. However, while such actions weaken the education system, there are more deadly pseudosciences. Ones that hit the medical field are quite a nuisance, and tend to be damaging to people's health. We're all familiar with the ""natural cure"" idea, or other such nonsense. A more obscure bit of pseudoscience is the Gerson Therapy.

Briefly, the idea is that cancer and other diseases are caused by buildups of toxins and poisons in the body. The ""cure"" for this is to: 
-drink 13 glasses of juice made from organic fruits and vegetables
-eat vegetarian meals of organic fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
-take several supplements, like Potassium, Lugol's Solution, CoQ10, etc.
-take coffee enemas
-prepare food without salt, spices, oils, or aluminum cookware

Now, here is why it's bad science. 1st, no laboratory or animal studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Most published information has come from retrospective studies. In fact, the National Cancer Institute(NCI) reviewed the published cases in 1947 and 1959, and concluded the following:

""In 1983-1984, a retrospective study of 38 patients treated with the Gerson therapy was done. Medical records were not available to the authors of the study; information came from patient interviews. These case reviews did not provide information that supports the usefulness of the Gerson therapy for treating cancer.
In 1990, a study of a diet regimen similar to the Gerson therapy was done in Austria. The patients received standard treatment along with the special diet. The authors of the study reported that the diet appeared to help patients live longer than usual and have fewer side effects. The authors said it needed further study.
In 1995, the Gerson Research Organization did a retrospective study of their melanoma patients who were treated with the Gerson therapy. The study reported that patients who had stage III or stage IV melanoma lived longer than usual for patients with these stages of melanoma. There have been no clinical trials that support the findings of this retrospective study.
A case review of 6 patients with metastatic cancer who used the Gerson therapy reported that the regimen helped patients in some ways, both physically and psychologically. Based on these results, the reviewers recommended that clinical trials of the Gerson therapy be conducted.""

Not so good, is it?

Quackwatch has a good review as well, and adds:
""Between 1980 and 1986 at least 13 patients treated with Gerson therapy were admitted to San Diego area hospitals with Campylobacter fetus sepsis attributable to the liver injections [18]. None of the patients was cancer-free, and one died of his malignancy within a week. Five were comatose due to low serum sodium levels, presumably as a result of the ""no sodium"" Gerson dietary regimen. As a result, Gerson personnel modified their techniques for handling raw liver products and biologicals. However, the Gerson approach still has considerable potential for harm. Deaths also have been attributed to the coffee enemas administered at the Tijuana clinic.

Charlotte Gerson claims that treatment at the clinic has produced high cure rates for many cancers. In 1986, however, investigators learned that patients were not monitored after they left the facility [19]. Although clinic personnel later said they would follow their patients systematically, there is no published evidence that they have done so. Three naturpaths who visited the Gerson Clinic in 1983 were able to track 18 patients over a 5-year period (or until death) through annual letters or phone calls. At the 5-year mark, only one was still alive (but not cancer-free); the rest had succumbed to their cancer [20].""

The American Cancer Institute had this to say:
""There have been no well-controlled studies published in the available medical literature that show the Gerson therapy is effective in treating cancer.

In a review of the medical literature, researchers from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center identified 7 human studies of Gerson therapy that have been published or presented at medical conferences. None of them were randomized controlled studies. One study was a look-back study (retrospective review) conducted by the Gerson Research Organization in 1995. They reported that when patients with melanoma, colorectal cancer, and ovarian cancer were treated with surgery and Gerson therapy, survival rates were higher than would normally be expected, but they did not provide statistics to support the results. Other studies have been small, had inconclusive results, or have been plagued by other problems (such as a large percentage of patients not completing the study), making it impossible to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of treatment.

Some parts of the Gerson regimen, such as eating large amounts of fruits and vegetables and limiting fat intake, can be part of a healthy diet if not taken to extremes. Researchers are continuing to study the potential anti-cancer properties of different substances in fruits and vegetables, but their individual and collective effects are not well understood at this time. Because of this, the best evidence suggests eating a balanced diet that includes 2 and ½ cups or more a day of vegetables and fruit, choosing whole grains over processed and refined foods, and limiting red meats and animal fats as well as alcohol. Choosing foods from a variety of fruits, vegetables, and other plant sources such as nuts, seeds, whole grain cereals, and beans is likely to be healthier than consuming large amounts of one particular type of food. Based on currently available evidence, diet is likely to play a greater role in preventing cancer than in treating it.

There is very little scientific evidence to support the use of other components of the Gerson regimen, such as consuming only fresh, raw juices prepared in a certain way, eliminating salt from the diet, and “detoxifying” the liver through coffee enemas and injected liver extracts. These methods have very little scientific evidence to support their use against cancer.""

The Gerson therapy has no evidence to support it, and is meaningless to cure cancer, that much is clear. Yet every lie has a grain of truth to it. Eating the right types of foods is important to give our bodies the strength it needs, along with good habits like exercising regularly and not smoking. I've always thought that people blame doctors for not solving their problems from lifestyle choices, but that's for another time.

That said, what the Gerson therapy offers is hope. Having cancer or another disease is terrifying, especially in late stages if undetected. Having to face death scares people, and people like Charlotte Gerson( Max Gerson's daughter) prey on such people. The kind of morality to promote this false cure makes me sick. To those with cancer or those who know someone who struggles with it, I say this. DO NOT fall for such miracle cures. It's difficult for anyone to not reach out desperately when faced with such a situation, but do not compromise your health further. You are not alone in facing this problem, and we will give all we can to help to live out the best possible life.

If I'm not supposed to post links to a thread I'm in then I apologize. I actually mean to post this as a proxy for a few discussions I've had on Reddit in the past.

For some reason Redditors seem to have it in their heads that the speed of light is just one of those things that can and will be broken with a little good old fashioned ingenuity and technology. I don't really know why. The speed of light is not analogous to the speed of sound, which famously took a while to beat. It is a very fundamental thing. Light will have a velocity of c in any reference frame. No matter how fast you travel light will seem in your reference frame to have the same velocity. It cannot be exceeded. To do so would violate the basics of causality.

This is basic science here. Like, high school stuff. Everyone knows this. So I have to ask, why is this idea that the speed of light can be beaten so popular? Do people not realize that Star Trek is fiction? ""Warping spacetime"" to somehow go faster than light doesn't make sense and it doesn't get around the fact that FTL travel breaks causality.

This is actually a well thought-out article that is presented in a coherent and mostly sensible way. This is good, because it makes it much easier to point out all the big errors when you can actually understand what he's saying!

The article is written by a guy with a PhD in solar dynamics (who worked on data from SOHO). He is trying to demonstrate that the finite speed of light does not prove that the universe is ancient. Let's go through his points.

1. The assumption of a constant speed of light

This isn't really an assumption. The speed of light is tied up with the strength of electric and magnetic fields, and this would cause chemical and atomic structure to change over time. This would produce different spectral lines depending on how long ago the light was emitted - we don't see this, so it would have to be a very small effect, and not a change by a factor of millions over thousands of years. It also causes major issues for keeping stars stable. However, he admits that a variable speed of light isn't very likely.

2. Gravitational time dilation could make time on Earth slower, especially if we live in an earth-centred finite universe (i.e. we're at the bottom of the potential well)

From galaxy surveys, the universe is pretty uniform in density, so the potential is pretty flat (except near the edges) and won't cause significant gravitational time dilation. If the time dilation was strong enough to convert billions of years into thousands, we would also see enormous blue-shifts, and we don't see that.

3. The assumption of synchronicity

He doesn't really invoke a mechanism here, he just says ""maybe things aren't synchronised?"". But the lack of synchronization in relativity comes from gravitational fields and from velocities, and everything we observe is slow enough that it isn't a big factor. Things being unsynchronized and having time dilation are linked together, and you'd again expect huge red/blue shifts for this to work.

4. The assumption of naturalism

Basically, this is giving up on being a scientist and saying ""maybe God just made it that way?"". This is basically a ""God of the gaps"", where we shove God into an ignorance-shaped hole. In this case, it is particularly silly because we can observe galaxies billions of light-years away and hence billions of years in the past. If there are any miraculous events that cause these galaxies to actually only be thousands of years old, then we should be seeing these effects occurring right now, and so we can observe them. Of course, you can get into God making illusions, but then you can just make up whatever you want.

5. The horizon problem

This is an issue, but it does seem to be explainable with inflation. The thing here is that whatever happened occurred when the universe was still opaque, so we can't ever see it directly.

6. In his conclusions he randomly brings up a couple of other things - the short life-times of blue stars, and of spiral arms.

Well, obviously the blue stars formed recently. Spiral arms are either short-lived, or are constantly ""recharged"" by interactions with satellites etc.",,,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,,,self,Answersingenesis on the speed of light,,,,http://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/2o6bdb/answersingenesis_on_the_speed_of_light/,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,1287524837.0,,

I am going to do that so that you don't have to. 

    1.  Joining Both Palms together to Greet

&gt;  However, scientifically speaking, joining both hands ensures joining the tips of all the fingers together; which are denoted to the pressure points of eyes, ears, and mind. Pressing them together is said to activate the pressure points which helps us remember that person for a long time. **And, no germs since we don’t make any physical contact!**

Gee, I wonder why physicians recommend washing hands. Your hands can and will carry germs that are harmful to you and not just others.  

http://www.cdc.gov/features/handwashing/

Also, pressure points are BS and not scientific in anyway. 

    2. Why do Indian Women wear Toe Ring

&gt; Normally toe rings are worn on the second toe. A particular nerve from the second toe connects the uterus and passes to heart. Wearing toe ring on this finger strengthens the uterus. It will keep it healthy by regulating the blood flow to it and menstrual cycle will be regularized. **As Silver is a good conductor, it also absorbs polar energies from the earth and passes it to the body.**

WTF is polar energy? I wish the author provided us the name of that ""particular"" nerve. Wearing a toe ring doesn't help regulate menstrual cycle. 

    5. Why do Temples have Bells     

&gt; These bells are made in such a way that when they produce a sound it creates a unity in the Left and Right parts of our brains. The moment we ring the bell, it produces a sharp and enduring sound which lasts for minimum of 7 seconds in echo mode. The duration of echo is good enough to activate all the seven healing centres in our body. This results in emptying our brain from all negative thoughts.

The concept of healing centers is pure psuedo-science. 

    15. Why Married Women apply Sindoor or Vermillion


&gt; This is so because Sindoor is prepared by mixing turmeric-lime and the metal mercury. Due to its intrinsic properties, mercury, besides controlling blood pressure also activates sexual drive. This also explains why Sindoor is prohibited for the widows. For best results, Sindoor should be applied right upto the pituitary gland where all our feelings are centered. Mercury is also known for removing stress and strain.

This is infuriating of all. First of all this is sexist for trying to imply that widows shouldn't do anything to increase their sex drive. Mercury is used in Ayurveda where it is thought to increase sex drive and it is not factual in any way. 

    16. Why do we worship Peepal Tree

&gt; Our ancestors knew that ‘Peepal’ is one of the very few trees (or probably the only tree) which produces oxygen even at night. So in order to save this tree because of its unique property they related it to God/religion.

Peepal tree does NOT release oxygen during the night. 

The rest all are even more ridiculous and I don't want to lose my sanity. The only plausible point is the [point of fasting](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2253665/), but the explanation is equally bullshit.

I'll start with asking why Veganism is the Future felt the need to explain what a slaughterhouse is by resaying it in reverse with 'of' placed in the middle. To make it sound more violent? Slaughterhouse alone is violent enough. If it were trying explain what a slaughterhouse is to someone who never heard of a slaughterhouse before, it did nothing for their education. But anywho that's completely offtopic... after she shared this, and we shall refer to her as V for ease, my friend, who is to be named Z, responded with 'Violence'.

Now, meat is animal muscle and fat and is protein-dense, so yeah, it's *harder* to digest than some other foods. But with better chewing, your body takes care of it pretty well via extra acid secretion from the stomach's parietal cells and more active enzyme secretion from the pancreas. It's not impossible in any way. I'll let Z continue with his responses. In fact, I'll just do that for the whole thing really, use him to explain things:



&gt;I really think people exaggerate. The GMOs thing I agree with. The rest nit really. Meat is hard to digest but it's not indigestible. Either way, we wouldn't have climbed to the top of the food chain without eating meat.


V says ""That is an opinion not fact."" referring to Z's last sentence. Erm... no... that is definitely a fact. Since when was any herbivore at the top of a food chain? Being at the top of the food chain literally means being the thing that eats the stuff below you. You can't be the top without eating meat *by definition.* 
This actually get's Z upset so he responds thusly:



&gt; If you want facts here you go: meat is entirely digestible in our stomachs due to pepsin and hydrochloric acid with a pH of 2. This leaves a chyme substance that enters the intestine where it is further broken down by enzymes. Bile processes the fats, lactase beaks down the sugars, and chymotrypsin the proteins. It then goes to the small intestine where it bacteria further breaks it down. And this is in a matter of hours. There are many starches in plants and grains that our enzymes cannot break down but our bacteria does. Now here is an opinion: not being vegan is violence.



Rather than end here....it continues. V says:



&gt;yes thank you for correcting me. Meat is very hard to digest. As a matter of fact it takes about double the time to digest meat than it is to digest vegetables taking about 4 to 4 1/2 hours to be absorbed in the intestines versus 2 to 2 1/2 for grains and vegetables, although not all parts of the meat is digested some is left behind and gets stuck on your intestinal walls.. ...But not EVERYTHING digested in the meat is good for you actually it can harm you more each time you eat it. The bacteria in our stomach comes from eating meat. Our bodies only form bacteria when it eats what its not suppose to. Basically setting your self up for early death. Starches is a matter that cannot be broken down that easily as well. starches is a carbohydrate that barely has water making hard to break down.

&gt;never said not being vegan meant violence. eat whatever you want whenever but just because you don't agree with it does not mean it is exaggerated or is not true. many lives have been shortened because of wrong dietary consumption..Processed foods also being a culprit. We cant really escape this life style in America.




Wow....just....wow. I happily joined in at this point with:




&gt;""The bacteria in our stomach comes from eating meat."" Well thank gods for meat then, those bacteria keep us alive.




I got this response from V: ""Lol rudy.. no -__- just no""



Every person has bacteria in their stomache that helps the digestive process. Without them we'd die. This is a medical fact. I'm sure there is more to it than that, and bad meat can give you bad bacteria, but all bacteria in our stomachs coming from meat? No -__- just no.




It tapered off after that with V's last post on the subject essentially saying that the post was Vegans of the Future's belief and not her's, she only shared it because... well she never explains that. But she does point out that all she cares about is health.



To end this parade, [it's not actually science at all but I thought it was funny enough to include] V's last comment was essentially that she's very religious [christian] and believes the Bible promotes her vegan lifestyle, claiming that 'God is not pro meat'. Z is also religious and argued that point as well, but I'll only talk about my own response which was to point out the story of Cain and Abel, wherein God essentially shuns some fine vegan cuisine for a fresh barbecued lamb. Not science at all I know, but I thought it was quite funny.

&gt; I came across a lady selling organic mangoes and she says these are *biodynamic* and so I asked her what it means. She said they sing Sanskrit chants to the trees and now the mangoes are infused with the power of these chants.

Anyway, here is the [link to wiki on Biodynamic agriculture.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodynamic_agriculture) 

This seems to have a weird mix of organic farming, homeopathy and a dash of mysticism. 

[This document](http://puyallup.wsu.edu/~linda%20chalker-scott/horticultural%20myths_files/myths/biodynamic%20agriculture.pdf) provides a brief insight and criticism on the topic.   

From the document: 

&gt;The directions for preparing the eight biodynamic compounds are complicated and can be found on a
number of websites and in popular literature. Briefly,
two of the compounds are prepared by packing cow
manure (preparation 500) or silica (preparation 501) in
to cow horns, then buried for a number of months
before the contents are swirled in warm water and th
en applied to the field. **Cow horns are utilized as
antennae for receiving and focusing cosmic forces**, whic
h are transferred to the materials inside. The
other six compounds (preparations 502-507) are extracts of
various plants either packed into the skulls or
organs of animals (i.e. deer bladders, cow peritonea a
nd intestines) or into peat or manure, where they are
aged before being diluted and applied to compost.
The chemical elements contained in these preparations
were said to be carriers of “terrestrial and cosmic
forces” and would impart these forces to crops and thus
to the humans that consume them. 

Sigh. 

R.1 There is no scientific evidence that suggest cow horns act as antennae for cosmic forces. There is also no evidence to suggest that religious chants help improve harvests and the taste.

Violin is so pretty, I play guitar, but damn if pink floyd made a solo with one, id probably be a violinist today lol. I am a nerd too. An idiot with hope in tiny particle physics. 
I want to build an absolute recycled and clean energy reactor, so we can get off our asses and Explore the universe like intelligent life should lol. This is honestly because of a dream i had a long time ago. So i am still so far below what i need to be as far as... Ummm being competent in physics lol.

So i know an actual structured program would be a huge help, but im actually studying physics strictly for locating the smallest magnetic and splittable parts and moments, i believe the field is created/ prevented during hadronic sub particle moments. I guess i believe in enough precious science that at least it brought me this far. Lol (summing with this analogy: quarks gluons and neutrinos are to a hadron what protons neutrons and electrons are to an atom, and hadrons are the factor in all observable forces in said atoms) 

If gluons and quarks make the hadron, a piece of a particle a whole class smaller than those that make the sum of parts of an atom, aka P, N, e-, then the sum of quark and gluon class quantam particles are the heart and blood for the potential forces in any given atom. Naturally That includes strong/ weak forces, an ion, covalent and ionic attractions and bonds, magnetism, and the specific individual properties observed by anyone who wishes to test this. 

Since hadrons are sometimes built with constant polar magnetism, its observed by examining a typical permanent iron magnet, the range and intensity of magnetism can be quantified, or canceled, depending entirely on other hadrons in harmonic or enharmonic magnetic moment. The variance force is observable with a 3 phase brushless electromagnetic motor. Energy is found in all negatively charged hadrons and observed in the presence of their electronic contribution when examined while performing work in any electrical system)/potential ability to contribute future work.

Basically, i dreamed (legitimately, im a highschool grad 4 years out, so i honestly wouldnt have studied physics at all without that dream) of how we can make fuel that can burn in a closed system, perform work, and remain fuel for future work.

Its only known today as inert Helium4. Think in the parts at work within He4 though, not the whole. It will be crucial for future energy, obviously under different circumstances than the He4 is found in today, just wasting its important long life and future job, pointlessely lifting a stupid Balloon.

Geez this was long Lol. I hope i made at least a little sense.... We will build a nuclear generator one day, that emits zero radiation and puts the uranium cores in the dust, like a topfuel dragster vs a prius, where the prius burns 10^75 more fuel just to get there.

This is sorta low-hanging fruit, but it has appeal to certain types of people, so I figured it was worth posting here.

&gt; I'm stick and tired of people telling me the body can't detox without 'fruit and vegetables'. So I guess that's why water fasting doesn't work? :P

The first big issue with this is the lack of definition of ""detox,"" and the assumption that the term is [anything but alternative medicine bunk](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/detox_overview.html). 

&gt; The body has many systems for detoxing and even makes it's own anti-oxidants which are many many fold more efficient that any from food. One thing the body does need though, for detoxing, is quality protein. The liver is the main detoxifier of the body and requires protein to do so. A good example is Campbell's rat studies, the high-protein rats got PRE-cancerous lesions, but the low-protein rats ALL DIED!

&gt; The body's biggest anti-oxidant is glutathione.

Well yeah, the liver expresses high levels of [CYP enzymes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450). The CYP1, CYP2 and CYP3 families metabolize drugs and steroids, and even some endogenous non-steroidal compounds (e.g. [melatonin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15616152)). 

It is true that the body makes many antioxidants, like melatonin. Glutathione is an important antioxidant in the body, but ""biggest"" is a misleading term (biggest in size? Most important? Most potent? As determined by what? Hopefully not [ORAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_radical_absorbance_capacity)). And yes, there are [tons of antioxidants found in food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_antioxidants_in_food). To my knowledge  most food-borne antioxidants (minus vitamins) suffer from poor bioavailability (e.g. [polyphenols](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15640486)). [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15164117) [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15585768) [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11739867) [4](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18209272) Glutathione is also found in plants, bacteria, and archaea in addition to animals. [Wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione)

The number of compounds with antioxidant activity found in plants demonstrated *in vitro* at least is massively high, and is growing. Much fewer of them have been assayed for bioavailability and antioxidative activities *in vivo*. It's bad science to make the assumption that antioxidants made by the body are more efficient than *any* antioxidant from food. We simply don't have enough information to be able to answer that question. It's bad science to jump to unsubstantiated conclusions. 

What does quality protein mean? Complete? Complete proteins contain all the [essential amino acids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_amino_acid).Those can be easily obtained from animals, yes, but also [cashews](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3173/2) and [soy](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4389/2) (probably more plants too). It's also possible to obtain all essential amino acids from a combination of grains, legumes, and/or nuts. 

&gt; Most people don't get enough selenium, additionally the USDA RDA is 55ug, but studies show that 200ug is a much more appropriate intake.

There's more here, but I'm short on time here. I'll get to my favorite part:

&gt; Thus scurvy is not a disease of lack of vitamin c but a combined lack of ascorbic acid and insufficient uric acid. Supply either will cure scurvy, thus gout suffers are highly unlikely to suffer from scurvy as well.

[It's not](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/195196730)? [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3197848/) [3](www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2567249/) Uric acid is known to have some antioxidant effects (discussed in relation to vitamin C [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2743829/)). Serum vitamin C and uric acid [appear to have an inverse relationship](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3169708/). As discussed there, vitamin C inhibits uric acid synthesis. Read the discussion section for possible mechanisms.

&gt; Removing xanthine oxidase inhibitors from a diet rich in fresh protein will cure and prevent scurvy.

Another baseless claim.

&gt; It seems that ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and uric acid have the same functions and are possibly opposed to each other. Those on an all meat diet don't get scurvy and uric acid is likely why, as it has huge anti-oxidant capacity and is increased when you eat a lot of meat.

The author needs to demonstrate that uric acid is able to replace ascorbic acid as a cofactor for [at LEAST dopamine β-hydroxylase, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, and peptidylGly α-amide oxidoreductase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C#Role_in_mammals). This is WITH the assumption that meat provides sufficient hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine for collagen synthesis, and that dietary carnitine consumption is adequate and sufficiently absorbed. Also, ""huge"" antioxidant capacity needs to be quantified, if it's even comparable with ascorbic acid. Also as discussed on the wiki page, vitamin C is found in small amounts in meat and moreso in liver, but cooking destroys most vitamin C, so these animal products would need to be eaten raw/minimally cooked. To make such grandiose claims about uric acid is unsubstantiated; making claims without evidence is bad science. This guy appears to think [we don't need vitamin C](http://mostlymeatiswhatieat.blogspot.com/2013/08/carnivore-rda-chart-end-of-long-road.html) - it looks like he's trying to make his claims match his preconcocted conclusions (say that 5 times fast), while citing ~~truckloads~~ no evidence to support his claims.",,,False,badscience,t5_2qph7,,,default,In which vitamin C is not a necessary nutrient and is functionally the same as uric acid.,,,,http://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/2hq4q7/in_which_vitamin_c_is_not_a_necessary_nutrient/,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,

The most damage happened at a pilgrim site called Kedarnath - which houses a pretty famous temple. 

[The article reporting her statements.](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uma-bharti-says-human-excretion-caused-u-khand-floods/article1-1264697.aspx) 

From the article:

&gt; Her observations came during an interaction with experts – albeit bemused -- of the Dehradun-based Himalayan Institute of Glaciology and Forest Research Institute. Pointing out that human excretory activities were forbidden within the natural boundary formed by the Mandakini and Saraswati rivers which flowed near the shrine in 1882, Bharti said, “However, as time passed, atheists came here, mainly for business purposes. This resulted in nature’s fury at Kedarnath in 2013”.

&gt; She, however, added that the “immediate reason” for the Kedarnath deluge was cloudburst and excessive rains in the state which had left over 6,000 people dead. “But the underlying reason was human excretion,” she added.

R.1

There is no evidence to prove that human excrement was the reason behind the flood. However, most environmentalists agree that the reason for the flood to occur was man-made. It was mainly due to building hotels and resorts on the banks of the rivers and poor enforcement of zonal laws. 

[From a journal published recently](ftp://ftp.solutionexchange.net.in/public/drm/resource/WP8UttarakhandDevpEcoSustainabiit3.pdf), the authors conclude by stating: 

&gt; There is reason to believe that the disastrous
impact of the intense rainfall between June
15 and 17
was magnified by human actions in
the name of ‘development’. For 13 years after
the formation of Uttarakhand, successive
state governments have recklessly pushed an
economic growth model that totally disregards
Uttarakhand’s disaster-prone character. The
state must rethink its entire approach to
development.

&gt; In June 2013 no one in Uttarakhand – central
government agencies, the state government
or the society at large – was prepared for an
extreme rainfall event. Such preparedness is
necessary in areas like the inner Himalayan
region in the summer when the presence of
hundreds of thousand tourists, pilgrims and
service providers enhance the disaster risk and
vulnerability.

I saw this article linked on a blog:

&gt;Millions of years of fist fights have altered the human face to leave men's jaws more robust than women's, a study has found.
Evidence suggests it evolved to minimise damage from bruising altercations after our ancient ancestors learned how to throw a punch.
Researchers studied the bone structure of australopiths, ape-like bipeds living four to five million years ago that pre-dated the modern human primate family Homo.
They found that australopith faces and jaws were strongest in just those areas most likely to receive a blow from a fist.
It is a legacy that continues to this day, helping to explain why men's faces are more robust than women's, say the scientists.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/evolution/10884763/Human-face-shaped-by-millions-of-years-of-fighting-study-finds.html

And the commentary:

&gt;1. The first thing you learn in any martial art that involves striking with the fist is how easy it is to break your hand on someone's face. The fist is not, in fact, the best way to hit someone with your hand. Having broken several bones in my right hand twice (once while studying Kung-Fu and the other while in a Taekwando class), I can personally verify that an imperfectly thrown punch is far more likely to damage the puncher than the punchee. So why didn't the hands evolve to be less delicate instruments, if our ancestors were pummelling one another with them?

&gt;2. If you want to hurt a guy, his face is not your best target. According to the logic of these researchers, our species should have evolved solid steel scrotums and thick bone covering the solar plexus. People who actually know how to fight will tell you that punching is a very small part of it. Real fighting doesn't involve a lot of gentlemanly pugilism. It's ugly and chaotic, involves choking, biting, and joint breaking, and takes place on the ground.

&gt;3. Presumably, our australopith ancestors lived in areas with plenty of sticks and stones, both of which are far superior to fists for causing injury, thus effectively neutralizing the logic of this fist/face hypothesis.

&gt;4. The researchers claim that ''These bones are also the parts of the skull that show the greatest difference between males and females in both australopiths and humans. In other words, male and female faces are different because the parts of the skull that break in fights are bigger in males.'' Great thinking there. So why do male dogs, bears, and sea lions have larger, wider faces with thicker bones? Did those male sea lions evolve more robust faces to absorb the blows of being flipper-slapped?

Here's a disclaimer though...due to the subjective nature of this post it can flirt into personal biases but I'll try my best to be objective. I completed the Phillips Golden Ears test online a few months back along with my DJ skills and producer skills (a lot of listening ability is trained) so I hope I'm qualified to answer this!

Let's confess my bad science sins that I'm guilty of first...high resolution audio! There's really no need for a digital audio file to be higher than 44.1khz sampling rate and 16 bit depth. Why? It is more than enough to express the human range hearing of 20hz-20khz. Any more than that is pointless. [Nyquist-Shannon sampling is really the basis of digital signals as we know them](http://www.dspguide.com/ch3/2.htm). Digital signals are discrete and each value in the sequence of integers represent is the amount of samples which also determines the bandwidth then the DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) converts it into an analog signal. Now wouldn't a higher bandwidth digital signal sound better than one of a lower bandwidth? Not really...44.1khz is really the bottleneck of digital quality. In order to hear the difference on a file with a much higher sample rate you probably need the ears of a dog!

Bit depth is another aspect I've mentioned before. 24 bit is a new fad. It's often considered studio quality (though most contemporary Digital Audio Workstations are in a native 32 bit environment because it's easier that way) but the studios need it when applying thousands of effects and offers way more noise floor room but for listening experience it's redundant. 

All right....let's talk lossless versus lossy at a normal 44.1khz sampling rate (lossy files do not really have a bit depth!) MP3 and Flac is what I almost entirely use so I will use them. To be brief is that there is no audible difference between v0 and lossless as long as it's encoded right. I use 320 a lot of the time though for DJing since algorithms can't detect the BPM on variable bitrates and most online shops only do 320 only even for non dance music however I will always pay extra for the lossless file because it's extremely useful for archiving purposes.  I will compare a song using audacity of a song using lossless and lossy (320 bitrate) to prove evidence: http://imgur.com/a/XrTg8 ([Song used...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6qefV4ckbk)it's a web version too I promise!) There is minimal difference. The compression is the same. I can't get my spectogram software to save the two other wise that would have been more scientific.

Does vinyl sound better than digital? This is a very common audiophile mishap and there are a lot more factors than vinyl (cartridge, turntable and even preamp) than a digital source...pressing my own music to vinyl I know a bit about vinyl mastering. Vinyl tends to have a weaker bass than digital because there's a frequency cut off range since the lower frequency there is the bigger groove there is. It's fine for a 12"" dance single but for an actual LP the bass will be noticeably weaker. Most vinyl is pressed on 150 grams...anymore is unnecessary and gimmicky IMO *cough 180grams repress*.  Records can and will wear down too after hundreds of use. It's a bit more fragile than a digital file however there is an aesthetic pleasing experience about vinyl and playing with vinyl however that digital files can't reproduce but that's out of the realm of science but just don't go claiming that vinyl is better than digital.

In order to actually improve the audio sound...you can't rely on a digital format or even rely on vinyl. The three things that are needed for a most definite noticeable improvement in sound are speakers/headphones, an amplifier and a DAC. Replace the DAC with a phono preamp for vinyl. Those three things (even less so with the DAC and phono preamp) will make a difference in the sound. There is a point of diminishing returns at a consumer level though so read up heavily! Also do research on discogs and other music sites to see which studio master sounds is better. This is a really big point especially with remastering and the loudness war!

Apparently it's common knowledge that testosterone levels in a group arbitrarily separated by social construct fits a certain mold? Wat? Here's some bad science in this and in more comments in the thread

1. He talks about how these things supposedly effect all kinds of physical differences. The problem is, ""black"" is just an arbitrary racial construct. There's nothing to separate black and ""not-black."" If you're gonna go by skin color, at what color gradient do they cease to be black?

2. You know what *is* common knowledge in biology? That there is not a single gene that is present in everyone of a race to supposedly separate races.

&gt;There is medicine that is made specifically for certain ethnic groups, including for blacks.

""Black"" is not an ethnic group. Race and ethnicity are not the same thing. Once again, at what point is someone not black? Now, a big thing pointed to here is the whole sickle-cell anemia thing that's used by race realists. The thing is, sickle-cell anemia genes are associated with tolerance to malaria. So the gene is more correlated with ancestors from a region with malaria, not a supposed ""race."" 

Also, skin color tends to be more correlated with the latitude your ancestors lived in, not some race realism genes bs

&gt;But he has a point. Every race looks slightly different. This means they are genetically different by the slightest of ways.

No no no no no. People look different, most diversity is found *within* each supposed race. You'll find most genetic diversity if you take a bunch of people from the same region.

&gt;Does your 3-year-old have a strange understanding of the inner workings of the Titanic?

No! As a matter of fact, no 3-year-old does!

&gt;Is your 6-year-old boy able to translate the words of Adolf Hitler?

If he's bilingual, then perhaps!

&gt;Does your 7-year-old girl say bizarre things about how she spied on you in a window from heaven before she was born?

No, but honestly I fail to see why we should assume that things said by 7-year-olds are true!

&gt;As strange as it sounds, some people believe those anecdotes are signs the kids were reincarnated.

Yes, that does sound strange. Have these people just never met kids before? Do they assume that kids have fully developed brains and a firm grasp on reality? You can scare a kid just by putting on a mask in front of them. GEE THIS MUST MEAN THEY HAVE A REALLY THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PERCEPTION, IMAGINATION, AND REALITY.

* **Adult-Like Behavior**:  Kids who’ve allegedly been someone else in a past life seem to act in a way beyond their years and show skills more in common with someone older.

No fucking shit sometimes kids act like adults. I mean, they do *turn into adults over a period of many years*, so it really shouldn't surprise anyone who has a basic grasp of the concepts of growth and aging.

* **Specific Past-Life Memories**:  Alvarez-Smith says the supposedly reincarnated kids she’s interviewed say things like “I was on the train” or “I used to be….”

Properly using the past tense is indeed impressive! Surely these children could only have learned verb tenses from their past lives! Also, how else could they know what trains are? Nobody rides trains these days! *Checkmate, scientists*.

* **Traumatic Memories**:  Most of the kids Alvarez-Smith says are claiming they were somebody else in a past-life have traumatic memories of a violent death. One example is Carson Culpepper, who told her mom, Beth, she remembered being at the 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing, which happened years before she was born.

Do these nincompoops even know what false memories are?

* **Uncanny Knowledge Of Other Languages**: Kids who may be remembering a past-life sometimes have knowledge of the language they spoke, such as a 6-year-old boy who was able to translate the words of Adolf Hitler even though none of his relatives knew German.

Bull-fucking-shit. That's all.

* **Night Terrors**  The kids who believe they were someone in a past life often experience night terrors. “Their eyes are open, but they’re in the middle of a terrible nightmare,” Alvarez-Smith said.

There are also plenty of kids who experience night terrors and have no belief that they had past lives. Clearly, night terrors are evidence of *not having had past lives*. 

* **Advanced Skills**: Besides having knowledge of other languages, kids who may be having a past-life regression show advanced skills beyond their years.

Sure they do. Every fucking parent thinks their kid is special and advanced and above average. Guess what, most kids are likely to be above average in *something*. Sounds like a lot of these kids have parents with above-average levels of credulity.

* **Morbid Drawings Of Their Death**: Kids who’ve allegedly had a past life often remember that previous incarnation with really morbid and bloody drawings.

This is another of those ones which makes me wonder if the author has ever encountered children before. Those motherfuckers can be pretty damn morbid in their artistic endeavors, especially the little boys. I probably drew more explosions per week at age 9 than I have in my entire adult life.

* **Memories Of The Period ‘Between Lives’**: Children who believe they were someone else in a previous existence sometimes have vivid memories of the “in-between” stage. They also tell their parents they saw them through a window in heaven before they were born.

Again, [children are full of shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RegxuU8NOhs). 

* **Talk About The Earlier Mother** Kids who claim they’ve had a past life will bring up their earlier parent by talking about “my other mother.”

Or maybe Daddy's just seeing someone on the side.

Nobody will dispute that. Yet there are no coal mines on Mars. There are no factories on Mars that I’m aware of.

FYI, temperature on Mars, according to [space.com](http://www.space.com/16907-what-is-the-temperature-of-mars.html):
&gt;On average, the temperature on Mars is about minus 80 degrees F (minus 60 degrees C). In winter, near the poles temperatures can get down to minus 195 degrees F (minus 125 degrees C). A summer day on Mars may get up to 70 degrees F (20 degrees C) near the equator, but at night the temperature can plummet to about minus 100 degrees F (minus 73 C). Frost forms on the rocks at night, but as dawn approaches and the air gets warmer, the frost turns to vapor, and there is 100 percent humidity until it evaporates.

**[Why It's Impossible For Reductive Materialism To Fully Explain The Universe](http://www.libertariannews.org/2014/07/03/why-its-impossible-for-reductive-materialism-to-fully-explain-the-universe/)**

While I'm unclear on how exactly this relates to libertarianism, I don't have the mental wherewithal to worry about that just now. Let's start on the claims that the article itself makes, and then move on to the comments section (which may be even more lamentable).

&gt;It is generally accepted that reductive materialism is the only acceptable philosophy for a scientist to hold.  It’s a form of physicalism that treats the entire universe as if everything is physical.  To quote wiki, “It asserts that mental events can be grouped into types, and can then be correlated with types of physical events in the brain.”

&gt;This type of philosophy has aided mankind in drastically improving his standard of living, and has worked well as a means of understanding the physical universe.  Of course, it seems to contain one glaring problem.  **Sensation and emotion are obviously non-physical, they are metaphysical.  The qualia of human experience cannot be reduced to computation by physical processes.**

(my bold) Well, that's a rather large assertion, one which is entirely too reminiscent of God-of-the-Gaps type arguments. ""Science can never explain"" is a rather weak argument at best, and if you're going to make it then you should probably have a solid basis on which to claim that X, by its nature, is not susceptible to physical explanation. These folks, on the other hand, simply assert it and insist that you must believe.

&gt;We can build super-computers capable of enormous computational power, far exceeding what a human could compute.  We can build super-sophisticated artificial intelligence that acts and learns the same way a human would.  Someday, we might even build robots so human like that they act like Commander Data from Star Trek.  **However, those robots will all have the same problem Data had – they can’t experience emotions.**

&gt;There is no way for computation, the flipping of 1s and 0s, or the changing state of matter, to ever arrive at a mathematical equation that results in the feeling of happiness springing into existence.  No matter how complex, no matter how obtuse, no matter how beyond comprehension an equation may be, it’s still nothing more than an equation.  The dumbest dog will always feel more real psychic pain when it is kicked than the most powerful complex android ever will.  This is where reductive materialism breaks down.

Perhaps we need /r/badsciencefiction! I must needs point out that there is a rich and storied literature of artificial intelligences which most certainly *do* feel emotion, not least of all AM, the supercomputer from *I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream*. It has something to say on the subject of emotion:

&gt;“HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR HUMANS AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT FOR YOU. HATE. HATE.” 

I could just as easily claim that fully conscious artificial beings will necessarily be consumed by hatred, because Harlan Ellison suggested that might happen. Our friend michaelsuede from libertariannews is, at heart, asserting that there is something about the human mind which is inherently nonphysical and not observable by empirical means. But why? Why is that the case? Why should we believe it? No reason.

&gt;This belief that consciousness springs into existence at some undefined point of brain complexity is a violation of reductive materialism.  If consciousness is “irreducible” beyond a certain level of brain complexity, then this is a clear failure of reductive materialist science.  The ONLY way the brain can achieve “awareness” AND be in compliance with a reductionist philosophy is if the components that make up the brain contain elements of conscious awareness to them.

Consciousness doesn't actually necessitate strong emergence (the proposition that some emergent systems are irreducible to their constituent parts and thus can't be simulated or recreated), since there are plenty of models of consciousness that don't require any sort of unconstrained free will and instead opt for a compatibilist approach or ditch free will entirely. In fact, anyone who's a reductive materialist is *highly* unlikely to subscribe to a strong-emergence description of consciousness.

&gt;...Awareness must be considered a fundamental irreducible component of the universe, rather than an irreducible component of whole-brain activity.  The ultimate conclusion being that all matter, even rocks, must have some level of awareness or “consciousness” to them.  This doesn’t mean rocks “think,” but rather that they contain a certain level of awareness, much like being in a state of perpetual meditation.

&gt;I presume the rock experiences “elements” of phenomenal states. It may be that the rock is aware it is a rock, but it perceives nothing else beyond that. Perhaps it perceives nothing at all. I don’t know. **All I know is that the matter the rock is composed of contains elements of consciousness within it.**

Ah, more ""you have to believe this because I say so"". Tell me, which element is consciousness? Is it somewhere up in the island of stability? There is no reason whatsoever to think that a rock has anything that can meaningfully be described by the word ""consciousness"". There is no evidence that a rock is aware of its surroundings, that it actively responds to them, or that it can conceptualize itself or anything else. But don't let that stop you!

The article goes on to describe some incidents of reported ""out-of-body"" experiences and so on. While it's certainly interesting to hear about those, and we obviously don't fully understand the brain, such experiences are not a sound basis for concluding that there is a supernatural element to consciousness. Just consider how many people, while unconscious or in comas, *don't* remember a single thing about it, or else claim to recall things which turn out to be inaccurate. This is why science isn't built on anecdotes but on repeatable data. If you can perform an experiment in which unconscious people can wake up and accurately say how many fingers you were holding up while they were out, then you have something worth talking about. Until then, you have anecdotes.

**&gt;If we are to take experiments like the Double Slit or Quantum Eraser at face value, indeed, all matter must be a product of focused intention.  The universe is really a “great thought,” rather than a “great machine.”**

NO NO NO YE GODS ABOVE NO! The [double slit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment) and [quantum eraser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment) do not, in any way, suggest that intentions, consciousness, brains, or awareness have anything to do with quantum mechanics. This is a persistent and pernicious misconception about quantum mechanics, which has been [debunked](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/11/13/803944/-Deepak-Chopra-vs-Quantum-Mechanics) [more](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/gs69u/what_constitutes_an_observer_in_quantum/) [thousands](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ub7c1/are_there_experiments_proving_or_refuting_the/) of [times](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/kau6y/what_does_observer_mean_on_a_quantum_level/) than [any](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1frgtk/quantum_mechanics_is_the_famous_double_slit/) physicist [cares to remember](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/kaok9/quantum_consciousness/).

--------------------------------

On to the disaster area of the [reddit comments](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/29rfzd/why_its_impossible_for_reductive_materialism_to/)! Bring something to bite down on, because this is gonna get painful:


&gt;All matter is a product of, or contains elements of, conscious awareness. The lab and thought experiments suggest matter is a product of a conscious observer. My position simply adds awareness to material reductionism.

Right, keep harping on the completely fucked interpretation of QM. Keep thinking it's true. This is like a cartoon in which /u/libertariannews has run off a cliff and believes himself to still be running on solid ground. There's not actually any evidence that consciousness has any sort of physical specialness to it.

&gt;So I can create feelings in a test-tube by electrifying chemicals?

Actually, if you have a planet-sized test tube and a few billion years, then yes, you should be able to. As one commenter replied, ""Can you perform computations in a test tube by electrifying silicon?""

&gt;Hey, if you have a theory about how electricity and chemicals can be combined into an emotional state, I'm all ears. 

Ah yes, continuing to ascribe some pretty serious ontological qualities to emotions. We already know that emotions are caused by processes in the brain, because physical alterations to the brain, whether stimuli or major surgery, can and do alter the emotional state of a person. Has this person never used a single mind-altering chemical before? If emotions have nothing whatsoever to do with the physical universe, then why are they so damned easy to generate with physical processes? Just a smidge of opiates in the system and people are euphoric. What is an emotional state? What is its wavefunction? What's that you say, emotional states can't be described? Then why are you claiming that they can be empirically shown to exist?

&gt;It's an impossibility for a purely physical system to conjure up non-physical phenomena, which is why strong emergence has been sidelined by most professional philosophers.
I like to use a Lego block example. If I give you a bucket of red lego blocks, could you ever build me a blue object?

Yes, brains are blue legos and consciousness is red legos. Does anyone else feel their brain slowly melting from reading this?

&gt;I presume the rock experiences ""elements"" of phenomenal states. It may be that the rock is aware it is a rock, but it perceives nothing else beyond that. Perhaps it perceives nothing at all. I don't know. All I know is that the matter the rock is composed of contains elements of consciousness within it.

You know that, do you? There's no evidence that it's the case, but you know it? Miraculous! We've got a truly revolutionary thinker on our hands!

&gt;Beyond logically concluding that consciousness is a fundamental part of the universe, I can only theorize about everything else. I can theorize about the rock. I can theorize about how consciousness interacts with matter or if matter is composed of consciousness. But theory is just theory, it's not solid stuff.

If it were solid at all, it might merit the term *theory*, but as it stands currently it's nothing but an edifice of unshakeable belief built on ludicrously bad assertions about quantum mechanics. This might even be worse than arguing with a young earth creationist, because at least they are sometimes less smug about the whole hoopla.

&gt;The admission by physicalists that their position is untenable is all I'm looking for

I can't debunk *all* of it, because there's a ton and it goes into fields like biology I don't know about, but here are some of my favorite bits:

&gt; Melanin is the chemical key to life itself! 

Spiders don't have melanin; I guess they're not alive.

&gt; It's found everywhere! — in animals, plants (that's why raisins are brown), soil, oceans, 
clouds even stars and comets! 

As far as I know the reasons that brown raisins are brown [has nothing to do with melanin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthocyanin). And you definitely wouldn't find any complex molecule in a star, it's *way* too hot.

&gt; Black Melanin is the super absorber of all forms of energy. It has ""black hole"" properties. It can convert light to sound and back again! It stores, transforms and conducts energy! ... Melanin can rearrange its chemical structure to absorb ALL wave-lengths of energy (sunlight, X-rays, music, radar) and can transmute and store this energy for later use

What the hell does this even mean? I'm not too up on what the biological function of melanin in the human body is, but I know it can't 'convert light to sound', let alone absorb x-rays (or else black people would have a hell of a time getting x-rays!).

&gt; Dr. Cress Welsing writes that Melanin gives us the ability to use 
our bodies as direct connections with the God Force, the source of all Energy -like 
plugging a cord into a wall socket.

Is that like the Phoenix Force? Are black people Jean Grey?

&gt; It also gives our hair antennae-like ability

Seriously, where the hell did this come from? It's not the first time I've seen 'hair is an antenna'; I previously posted [something along those lines](http://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/21t12j/hair_is_an_extension_of_the_nervous_system/). But basically... no, hair isn't conductive, the hair cells themselves are dead as a doorknob, everything about that idea is completely wrong.

&gt; BLACK is the meaning of Kam or Khem -- the name which the ancient Egyptians called 
themselves. From this word we get ""Chemistry,"" the study of the building blocks of Life.

This is more /r/badlinguistics, but 'chemistry' comes from 'alchemy', which ultimately comes from a Greek word meaning 'pour' 

&gt; 
mid-14c., from Old French alchimie (14c.), alquemie (13c.), from Medieval Latin alkimia, from Arabic al-kimiya, from Greek khemeioa (found c.300 C.E. in a decree of Diocletian against ""the old writings of the Egyptians""), all meaning ""alchemy."" Perhaps from an old name for Egypt (Khemia, literally ""land of black earth,"" found in Plutarch), or from Greek khymatos ""that which is poured out,"" from khein ""to pour,"" related to khymos ""juice, sap"" [Klein, citing W. Muss-Arnolt, calls this folk etymology]. The word seems to have elements of both origins.


&gt; Life is founded upon CARBON

All living matter that we know about so far, but yes, this is true as far as things go.

&gt; , the Black element present in all living matter

Carbon is black in the form of coal and graphite, yes, but carbon can also make diamonds.

&gt;  carbon atoms link to form Black Melanin, which has ""Black Hole"" properties!

Again with 'melanin is a black hole'!

&gt; This ""Black Body Radiation"" is at work in the electron, as shown by Nobel prize 
winner, Richard Feynman.

Does anybody have any idea what this means? I certainly have no clue.

&gt; The scientist, Jean Charaon 
proved that the electron has all the properties of the Black Hole

The idea that particles are black holes is one that I see get kicked around occasionally, but to the best of my knowledge it's untested at best and pseudoscience at worst. Any particle physicists want to chime in?

&gt; plus it exchanges ""Black Photons"" with other electrons

I think the author is thinking of 'virtual photons' here. The electromagnetic force is mediated by photons, and it is possible to view the electromagnetic interaction of two charged particles as influenced by short-lived 'virtual photons'

&gt; enabling it to continuously accumulate data. This means that if we view the electron as a carrier of memory, it has experienced everything in creation since the very beginning.

An electron is an electron is an electron. To the best of our knowledge, it's impossible even in theory to distinguish between two electrons; they don't have any 'history' of any sort embedded inside them.

There's a vast amount wrong with it, so I'll have to take it piece by piece, but the overall gist of it is that this person is shocked to learn that our current cosmological simulations don't model every single hydrogen atom in the entire universe, and because of this, they think that such simulations are really bad.

&gt;Images such as this one of the [Hercules Cluster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VST_image_of_the_Hercules_galaxy_cluster.jpg) present the imagination with an incredible depth and complexity of form in the universe. Ours does not seem (yet) a universe that is winding down in a process of never-ending entropic dispersal.

Yes, it most certainly does seem to be winding down. Star formation rates peaked when the universe was around ~3 billion years old, and they've been declining ever since. The gas reserves in galaxies are much sparser than they used to be, and there is not an efficient mechanism to cool intergalactic gas and get it into galaxies, certainly not on a timescale that could outrun cosmic expansion.

And posting a picture of the Hercules Cluster is meaningless and does nothing whatsoever to support this argument. Might as well post a kitty picture and talk about how kitties make us think deeply about the world. 

&gt;How ""early"" in the universe could life exist?

For complex carbon-based life similar to Earth life, probably not much earlier than a gigayear or so after the Big Bang. There's a variety of considerations, but basically you need a certain level of heavy element (aka anything with more than 2 protons) abundance in order to form a system which can host terrestrial planets, and then it will likely take the planet hundreds of millions of years to cool down sufficiently to host life as happened on Earth. Of course, this is sticking very closely to Earth history, but wandering far from our one example of abiogenesis results in a lot of unbounded speculation.

&gt;Maybe entropy is simply a tendency of nature, not a rule.

Yes and no. It's a tendency which is a rule. Entropy derives from statistical mechanics. It's mathematically provable that a system will tend toward entropy, and with a system as unspeakably gargantuan as, say, a milliliter of water, the sheer number of particles are such that entropy is an irresistible trend. So far we can be reasonably sure that this person has little or no understanding of astrophysics or statistical mechanics.

&gt;Hugely negentropic objects, such as Earth, come to be after tens of billions of years of 'time'. Yet, 'ordered' phenomenon do not fill space in isotropy nor do they exist in a way that can be explained by physics without ad-hoc fine tuning.

The [fine-tuning problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_Universe) is totally separate from the question of entropy. Fine-tuning is not what explains the physical process of dust grain agglomeration that produces the Earth. Physics and chemistry explains that. Fine-tuning is related to why physics is the way it is. Given our universe's physics, terrestrial planets will form. It's not a mystery how they form, and their entropy isn't in any way anomalous or interesting.

And putting ""time"" in scare quotes is meaningless, it does nothing to support the argument.

&gt;The search for the physical basis of time similarly rests on untenable assumptions. All time amounts to in physical conceptions of reality is a frame-referent dimensionless constant which differentiates one (conceptual/linguistic) ""time-slice"" from another.

**NO NO NO.** Time is not dimensionless. This is high school level physics. It's also not just some conceptual thing. It's exactly 100% as real as space. That's one of the main points of general relativity.

&gt;We must affix the meaning of time to the speed of light for it to mean something in calculations.

This is hilariously wrong. The fundamental definition of a second is ""the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom."" Has nothing whatsoever to do with the speed of light-- even though it uses the period of a light wave as a reference. The speed of light could be anything you want, but as long as the frequency of that photon emitted by cesium is the same, the definition of a second is the same. I suspect this person was confused by the fact that in general relativity the time term often has a *c* next to it. That doesn't do anything to subvert the reality of time, because you can easily just put the *c* below the space terms instead, and it's the same equation.

&gt; Quantum physics does not produce the voluminous data which would describe the behavior and interaction of systems of matter and energy in every square-foot section of an entire galaxy, let alone a hundred billion galaxies. If it did, it would need to account for every quantized sector of the entire holism of noumena and the agglomerative material interactions for a given spacetime. It would need to account for all interactions from bosons up to atoms, from atoms up to molecules, from molecules up to cells, cells to bodies, bodies to civilizations, civilizations to starships, to solar systems, to galaxies, to local groups, etc for every square inch of a given sector of space-time.

This is exactly what quantum mechanics (by the way, easy way to tell a real physicist apart from an amateur is that the professionals rarely say ""quantum physics"", they call it quantum mechanics) says. Everything in the universe is, at its most fundamental level, a probability wave function. This person chooses to simply say ""naaaaaaah that's too big, I can't grasp it, therefore it must not be the case"". The particle that make up galaxies are absolutely subject to quantum mechanics, it's psychotic to claim that they're not. This person is blaming quantum mechanics for our lack of collected data, which is pure idiocy. Knowing the rules of QM doesn't mean you know how many stars there are in the galaxy. That's a totally separate question.

&gt;Ultra large-scale conceptions of the universe are essentially stories told with particularly rigorous interlocking syntax. We have no physical models that tell us who might live in our universe. We similarly have no mathematical way to describe the deep future evolution of new integrative levels. To study this would be an open challenge of scientism's axiomatic ontology.

Oh for fuck's sake. Quantum mechanics is probabilistic to its core, the entire point of it is that you **cannot** predict everything based on initial conditions. The fact that we can't predict who lives in our universe is a *result* of quantum mechanics (as well as of our hilariously inadequate knowledge of the universe's initial conditions). 

&gt;One might ask the question, what is inside of a [Lambda-CDM cold dark matter computer simulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model) of the universe's large scale structure? Does it comprehensively and accurately model every level of the system evolution of the universe? Are we actually claiming to account for every system of particle interaction from virtual photons all the way up to the [Sloan Great Wall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Great_Wall)? It seems almost heretical to ask, and the answer is emphatically no. 

&gt;Physicists may cry foul at this point, saying that it would be ridiculous to perform calculations of such incredibly high resolution. Such a program would violate the [no-go theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-go_theorem) and present a mechanically untenable situation. Yet, to claim accuracy in the simulation of the universe begs the question of *which* universe one is accurately simulating. If it is our universe as described by QM and GR, it seems methodologically baseless to leave out 99.99% of space-time just to fit a model to the existing real-world trickle of electromagnetic data available.

Now here's where it gets really fucking off base. Large-scale structure simulations **explicitly do not model things below a certain size**. How the fuck is it heretical if the authors of these simulations explicitly state in their papers that the simulations do not have unlimited mass resolution? We've got one brave son of a bitch on our hands, everyone make way for the heretic!

This person fails to understand that quantum mechanics **does not drive large-scale structure formation**. We're not leaving out 99.99% of space in these simulations, it's all there but at much coarser resolution. Nobody is claiming that such simulations are a perfect model of reality, and it's a ridiculous straw man that's being presented by /u/evolang.

&gt;Cosmological modeling does not acknowledge or account for the system dynamics of long-range entanglement or future topological order of space-time.

nonsense nonsense nonsense nonsense nonsense

&gt;Cosmological modeling cannot currently provide accurate accountings of many cosmic structures which have emerged in the course of universal expansion and cooling. Indeed, there were at least two discoveries of enormous cosmological structures which defy the Standard Model in 2013 alone. 

Well, this person has just confused the Standard Model (which is quantum mechanics) with the Lambda-CDM model, which is general relativity/cosmology. But besides that, physics-defying things are discovered constantly, all the time. That's not interesting. What *is* interesting is if they aren't debunked within a few years.

There's a former astronaut, [Edgar Mitchell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Mitchell), who has either gone senile or has always been a kook, who believes in anything and everything paranormal &amp; alien. Of course, since he believes it, you have hordes of blithering morons who take that as the fucking Gospel, conveniently ignoring the *literally hundreds* of other astronauts who completely disagree with Mitchell. The entire thread is full of redditors who couldn't possibly find their way out of a paper bag insisting that because we didn't know physics 500 years ago, it's reasonable to believe that aliens have visited us.

&gt;To be fair, our focused understanding of physics is a few hundred years old at best. And in those few hundred years we went from ""apples fall"" to ""how to leave the goddamn planet"". Most recently we've come to understand that physics in the micro world (quantum physics) is pretty much fucked. We have NO idea what is going on down there, at least not yet.

&gt;Quantum physics breaks down our understanding of physics.

This is the most hilariously awful misunderstanding of science ever. Guys, physics breaks our understanding of physics! It contradicts itself! Oh wait, *no it doesn't*, this poster is just thoroughly ignorant of QM and is pretending that their ignorance means there's an actual mystery going on. Magnets, how do they work?

&gt;Remember Mitchell was an Apollo astronaut. He landed on the moon. He was chosen as the best of the best. He had ""the right stuff"". I seriously doubt he's delusional. I think he believes what he's been saying the last 20 years right or wrong.

Can people really, possibly be this unspeakably dumb? There are lots of people in high places who hold utterly ridiculous beliefs. Mitchell also believes in ESP, that doesn't make it true. Also, are these redditors just too young to have heard of senility?

The whole thread is full of appeals to ""But we don't know everything yet, so it's totally reasonable to believe that the US government is in frequent contact with intelligent beings from another planet who got here *somehow*!"" It relies on the fundamentally wrong belief that current physics is going to be *erased* by new physics. In reality, what new physics does is add onto the old and expand it into regimes that haven't been tested yet. Special relativity expanded Newtonian mechanics into the high-velocity regime, GR showed that classical gravity was just a mundane result of the actual way that mass &amp; spacetime interact, quantum mechanics showed that macroscopic happenings were the result of micro-scale laws. We know that something needs to be done to bring QM and GR into agreement about what happens in tiny regions of extreme curvature. So yes, we'll discover new physics. But it won't delete the existing theories in the regimes where they've already been tested.

A discussion erupts about how conspiracy theories are just the first step to conspiracy fact, and then someone dumps this steaming turd that they think is a description of the scientific method.

Notwithstanding the fact that it's still an oversimplification of how science works, the process goes something more like

* Have an idea

* Formulate hypothesis

* Test hypothesis/collect evidence

* Then build a theory on the evidence

""Proof"" doesn't even exist in scientific epistemology, it's all about degrees of certainty. At any rate, you certainly don't develop a theory before you even get evidence for it.
