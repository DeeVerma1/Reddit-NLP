As the fear of airborne illnesses has heightened, people have understandably become much more concerned about potentially contagious strangers and are choosing to go where high air quality standards are maintained. Conventional approaches have been focused on making filters tighter, but filter media can only be made so small before becoming difficult to move air effectively or efficiently. Reducing nanoparticles by agglomerating them into larger, aggregated clusters is the key. Larger particles are more easily mitigated and fall to the ground more quickly. Atmofizer is leading 4th generation in air technology, with patented agglomeration tech using acoustic pressure waves to reduce airborne nanoscopic particles-without using filters and saving our landfills! Another benefit we hear is the reduction of odors, including strong smoke odors like cannabis. Cleaner air apparently smells a lot better too!

**What is Peer Review Week?**

[Peer Review Week](https://peerreviewweek.wordpress.com/get-involved/) (PRW) is an annual weekly celebration of all things 'peer review', covering a specific theme which changes every year. The voluntary Steering Committee is open to anyone involved or interested in peer review from publishers, service providers, libraries, to peer reviewers, and the research and author community. It provides a platform for us all to come together with the common goal of celebrating peer review including the good, the bad and the ugly! ()

** What is the Royal Society?**

[The Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/) is a Fellowship of many of the world's most eminent scientists and is the oldest scientific academy in continuous existence. Since 1665, the Royal Society journals have been publishing important scientific discoveries - our past authors include Newton, Franklin and Faraday, through to Hodgkin, Hawking and Lonsdale. Today our journals continue to publish high quality, peer-reviewed content covering the full range of science and we encourage the submission of research from across the world.

We'll also check back and answer any additional questions that come in.

Early findings have revealed cell populations that are preferentially affected by Alzheimer's - both increasing and decreasing in number - and other physiological changes that could point to new targets for treatments in the future.

This massive, collaborative undertaking, the [Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Brain Cell Atlas](http://portal.brain-map.org/explore/seattle-alzheimers-disease) (SEA-AD), has resulted in a high-resolution, high-quality, publicly accessible atlas of aging and Alzheimer's disease. The massive data set represents detailed analysis of over 1.2 million brain cells from 84 patients. The data is openly available to other researchers in the hopes of catalyzing further research and improving our understanding of the complex and likely heterogenous nature of Alzheimer's.

We are:

I'm 6 feet away from a toddler, just barely minding him. He starts to climb up on a stool and I immediately know he's going to pull it down and topple over as he climbs, and before I can think about it my body leaps toward him to catch him before he falls to the ground.

Most of the headlines focus on the short and long-term impacts these disasters have on plants, animals and the economy. But what's going on underground? Research is just beginning to demonstrate the impacts disturbances to microbial communities can have on soil composition, plant behavior and human health.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (19UT) for an AMA, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, focused on the impact wildfires are having on microbial communities. We will take questions about experimental approaches being taken to study this issue, share insight into how the increased frequency and severity of fires is affecting ecosystems at the micro and macro levels, and discuss strategies for managing fire-affected ecosystems under changing fire regimes.

I started clicking the links in the memo, and reading what the evidence they were citing actually said. It seemed like they were using those citations in bad faith-that the science actually said something other than what the state said the research says.
And so, I reached out to to the doctors whose work Florida was holding up as rationale for banning transgender medicine for minors. Ten doctors all told me that they didn't know Florida was citing their work - and that Florida is distorting their scientific work to push an anti-transgender (and anti-science) agenda.

Earlier this month, my colleagues at VICE News and I published an investigation of our findings, showing that this is part of a larger pattern of Gov. DeSantis's administration going to extreme ends - including lying to health care providers - to block transgender kids from getting the health care they need and deserve.

Technically by limiting ourselves to only logic based units of dimensional measure we limit ourselves to only viewing observation with the dimension of time included.   


Superpositioning for example seems illogical as we monitor it in time via snapshots. However when you remove time from the equation you simply see a point of matter with a range of energy levels. No ""action"" is occuring because during superpositioning the forces are impacting dimensions outside of time but we filter the observation through time thus it seems illogical. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think much of this comes down to the current model of spacetime being 3 dimensions of space and 1 dimension of time and assumes that frame of reference is the only reference point required to understand physics.

&amp;#x200B;

 I want to challenge that theory as I believe the more appropriate representation would require 2 or more separate frames of reference if the same identical observation in time are required to properly define quantum physics as we need too look at the manifestation of the phenomenon through the lens of multiple reference points and combine them to define the dimensions of the observable. 

  
As well I think the current view of how dimensions are created is being viewed incorrectly as some observables must be observed outside the dimension of time thus we need a frame of reference other than spacetime. See my tweet below where I go through a physical example of what I think a dimensional model should appear using an empty vape cartidge and explain how you can create 3 dimensions by wrapping one dimension around another than pushing it into a third dimension.

I participated on the team that produced the first images and data for JWST (the Early Release Observations ---- EROs) --- and led the analysis that produced the first exoplanet spectrum (of many to come!) that was shown to the public of the exoplanet WASP-96b. I'm also part of several teams working right now on producing the very first scientific results on exoplanet atmospheres with JWST, which range on exciting new science from highly irradiated, gas giant exoplanets all the way to the very first observations with JWST of the small set of terrestial planets orbiting the TRAPPIST-1 star.

I was recently featured as one of the experts in NOVA's documentary film, Ultimate Space Telescope, about the engineering behind the JWST. You can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF-7eKtzAHM

Ask me anything about:

+ What are exoplanets? Why are they interesting to study with JWST?
+ What new frontiers will JWST explore in the field of exoplanet atmospheres?
+ What can JWST tell us about exoplanets orbiting stars other than the Sun? What can it tell us about our own planet?
+ What are the kind of results we should expect in this first year of JWST observations?
+ What can we expect for the future?

Before joining STScI, I was a Bernoulli Postdoctoral Fellow at the Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. In 2018, I was selected as the recipient of one of the prestigious IAU-Gruber fellowships by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) for my work on the field. I did both my undergrad (2012) and PhD (2017) at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, in Santiago, Chile, where I was born and raised.

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/s93rpe/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvi/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

But asking some Americans, I found out that actually the jury was split. This got me thinking...  


\- Are some color boundaries fuzzier / more ambiguous than others? For instance, yellow might not be as contentious a color as others, but that is just my impression. 

  
\- If some color boundaries are fuzzier than others, is that consistent across languages? For instance, is the boundary between green and blue always fuzzy?

As of mid-June, there were over 2100 reported cases of monkeypox in dozens of countries. While a great deal is already known about the science of the monkeypox virus, this outbreak has raised several new questions about its transmissibility and impact on human health in both the short and long terms. With the world's attention heightened to such disease outbreaks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this seems like a good opportunity to provide answers and help alleviate concerns.

We are experts in infectious diseases who are here to provide the facts about monkeypox and counter the mis-information that has been spreading about this disease. Join us today at 2 PM ET (18 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, about the monkeypox outbreak. We'll answer your questions about the symptoms of monkeypox and how it spreads, current strategies for treatment and prevention, and what can be done to contain this (and future) outbreaks. Ask us anything!

Today, June 30, is International Asteroid Day-but at NASA, every day is asteroid day!

Asteroids are rocky, airless remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago and NASA and our partners are always looking to the skies to study these ancient time capsules. From our missions [to explore the Trojan asteroids in Jupiter's orbit](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/lucy/in-depth/) and [bring a piece of an asteroid back to Earth](https://www.nasa.gov/osiris-rex), to our [efforts to find, track and monitor asteroids](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/pdco/index.html) and other near-Earth objects to protect our planet from potential impact hazards, we're uncovering the history of our solar system while working to keep our future safe.

Ask our experts anything about what we're learning from asteroids, how we're protecting the Earth, and much more!

Hoy, 30 de junio, es el Día internacional del asteroide, pero en la NASA, ¡todos los días son días de asteroides!

Los asteroides son restos rocosos sin atmósfera que quedaron de la formación temprana de nuestro sistema solar hace unos 4.600 millones de años. La NASA y sus socios miran constantemente al cielo para estudiar estas antiguas cápsulas del tiempo. Desde nuestras misiones para explorar los asteroides troyanos en la órbita de Júpiter y traer un trozo de asteroide de vuelta a la Tierra, hasta nuestros esfuerzos para encontrar, rastrear y monitorear asteroides y otros objetos cercanos a la Tierra para proteger nuestro planeta de posibles peligros de impacto, estamos descubriendo la historia de nuestro sistema solar mientras trabajamos para mantener nuestro futuro seguro.

Pregunta a nuestros expertos cualquier cosa que quieras saber sobre lo que estamos aprendiendo de los asteroides, cómo estamos protegiendo a la Tierra y mucho más.

Like, of course there's DNA: no creature will ever evolve on Earth that is not based in DNA. Right? And probably something similar, if weaker, applies to all the various crazy proteins and other stuff that makes a cell work. Like, look at how conserved photopigments are across the animal kingdom (even beyond, you can find photopigments in non-animals that might be evolutionarily related to the opsins in human and fly retinas, etc etc).

Then you can get up to bigger scales, to things like cell types. Like, will there ever be a descendant of animals that has no neurons? It seems like, since neurons first evolved, they are *stuck*. I read a paper a while back on similarities between invertebrate and vertebrate neurons, and was amazed. They even use more-or-less the same neurotransmitters (if in different roles).

Then bigger: since insects invented wings, virtually none of them have lost them (ants, sort of - and a few other very weird examples). And insects always have that exoskeleton and always will - no insect will ever evolve with an endoskeleton, right?

And how tetrapods all have this 1-arm-bone then 2-arm-bone then lots-of-bones plan for their arms and legs. It seems like that just will never go away (though you might lose your arms and legs, like a snake, if you have them they always follow that plan).

A year ago, we did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/m5i6g5/askscience_ama_series_hi_reddit_we_are_group_of/) answering science or technology questions on any topic from Reddit. We had a blast and so we're back again! So please ask us any questions any of you have to do with science or technology and how they affect your life. There are no silly questions - ask us anything and we will try to give an easy-to-understand answer and, wherever possible, provide some further sources to enable you to do your own research/reading.


Our goal is simply to advance everyone's understanding of science, engineering, and technology and to help people be better informed about the issues likely to affect them and their families.

CSES is a registered charity in the UK, founded in 1920. We're a volunteer group of over 250 members and our key strength is our diversity and interdisciplinary expertise. Our members come from a variety of educational, social, and economic backgrounds, from industry and academia and a multitude of age groups, representing groups from the millennials all the way to the Silent Generation (our oldest member being 98)!

There has been growing dis-information globally in the last 20 years. Today's global interconnectedness, while being hugely beneficial for making information easily accessible to everyone, has made it ever more difficult to determine 'truth' and who to trust. As an independent charity, not affiliated or biased to any particular group, but with broad knowledge we are here to answer any questions you may have and to hopefully point you to further reading!

Our goal is simply to answer as many of your questions as we can - but we aren't able to give advice on things - sorry! We will also be clear where what we are saying is the experience-based opinion of someone in our team.

So, Reddit... Ask us anything!

CSES will draw from its large pool of volunteers to answer your questions, however some of the people standing by to answer comments are:

+ **Professor David Humber**: Over 30 years' experience as a researcher, lecturer and senior university manager, specialising in immuno-biology and the life sciences.

I guess I understand that if you have a black hole, the mass must be in a singularity since, if you have gravity strong enough to bend space entirely inwards so that light can't escape, then surely there are no other forces that can resist this by pushing apart (like how atoms or neutrons push each other away) to constitute a body of some sort.

So it seems that a black hole necessarily contains a singularity?

Ok, then, if you have a situation where gravity is strong enough to create a singularity, is it necessarily also a black hole? Can you have a singularity so small that light can't fall into it, or something like that?

I'm sort of thinking of this case where you have a neutron star, and you add one neutron at a time... is there going to be a point where I add a neutron and ""pop"" it's a singularity / black hole, or is there some in-between (however narrow) where you're not quite one or the other?",True,False,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,22447035,public,self,is a black hole necessarily a singularity (and vice versa),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/uowy2z/is_a_black_hole_necessarily_a_singularity_and/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We're Rachel Davis, MD, (u/racheldavismd) and Moksha Patel, MD, (u/mokshapatelmd). We're here to answer your questions about deep brain stimulation and OCD, obsessive compulsive disorder. If you are struggling with OCD, you are not alone. Treatments and care are evolving.

Deep brain stimulation or DBS is a rare, invasive brain surgery where electrodes are implanted in the deeper structures of the brain. These electrodes are then connected to generators in the chest that deliver small currents of electricity to the brain, similar to cardiac pacemakers.

About Rachel:

I'm Rachel Davis, MD, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. I'm also medical director of the OCD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, program and co-director of the OCD surgical program. I've extensively studied deep brain stimulation for OCD and have worked with candidates, like Moksha, before, during and after the process.

About Moksha:

And I'm Moksha Patel, senior instructor of hospital medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine where I hold many roles. I've always been high-achieving and busy my whole life; working hard has helped me cope with crippling OCD. I recently worked with Dr. Davis and many others to undergo deep brain stimulation.

I've put in a lot of work with Dr. Davis programming my stimulator settings and engaging in intensive exposure therapy. It's been a challenging process, but I'm happy to say I'm feeling relief; I am more engaged in life and can travel, go out with friends and go about my day to day without being completely stuck in my head. I'm also working toward an MBA at the University of Colorado Denver.

I'm Dr. Richard Johnson, a professor of medicine specializing in renal health and hypertension at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. I'm also an adjunct professor at the University of Florida. I'm board certified in internal medicine, infectious diseases and kidney disease.

For more than 20 years, I have investigated the impact of sugar, especially fructose, on the human body and how we process it. I recently wrote *Nature Wants Us to be Fat*, a book outlining why evolution has programmed us to overeat on the promise that we will lose weight during lean times. However, it's no longer feast or famine - it's just feast.

My research reveals that we, as humans, all have a 'survival switch' that protects against starvation, but it's now stuck in the 'on' position.

Prior to my most recent book, I also authored, *The Sugar Fix* (2008) and *The Fat Switch* (2012). I've had the pleasure of lecturing in more than 40 countries and have been funded by the National Institutes of Health.

So, with that:

+ Why does nature want us to be fat?
+ What do we have in common with hibernating bears, sperm whales and the world's fattest bird?
+ Cold months drive animals to gain weight, but how does that impact humans? Is it out of our control?
+ What triggers fat storage for animals and how can we learn from them to understand the human metabolic condition?

But did you know that there are roughly 13 BILLION diagnostic medical tests performed every year, just in the United States? With such a high level of demand, there is a constant need for the development of diagnostic approaches with increased accuracy, higher sensitivity, and lower costs.

Unfortunately, as illustrated by several recent scandals (such as that involving former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, recently the subject of the Hulu show The Dropout), such great need means that the field of medical diagnostics can also be prone to great fraud. So how do professionals ensure the efficacy, safety and utility of diagnostics tests? What requirements and standards have regulators put in place to protect against fraud and abuse?

Join us today at 3 PM ET (19 UT) for an open discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, to discuss the field of medical diagnostics. We'll answer your questions about the research, regulatory and policy aspects of diagnostics. Ask us anything!

Our team of energy experts study the U.S. power grid, looking at ways to modernize it and make it more stable and reliable. We're not fans of brownouts. Recently, we conducted the largest simulation of its kind to determine how a transactive energy approach would affect the grid, operators, utilities, and consumers. In a transactive energy system, the power grid, homes, commercial buildings, etc. are in constant contact. Smart devices receive a forecast of energy prices at various times of day and develop a strategy to meet consumer preferences while reducing cost and overall electricity demand. Our study concluded consumers stand to save about 15 percent on their annual electric bill and peak loads would be reduced by 9 to 15 percent. We'll be on at 2:00 PM Pacific (5 PM ET, 21:00 UT) to answer your questions.

You can read our full report on our [Transactive Systems website](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/transactive-systems-program/dsot-study).

We are Ece Kartal (u/psecekartal), Sebastian Schmidt (u/TSBSchm) and Esther Molina-Montes (u/memmontes). We are lead authors on a recently published study showing that non-invasive (and early) detection of pancreatic cancer may be possible using stool samples. Ask Us Anything!

Pancreatic cancer is a horrible disease: although few people develop this form of cancer, only around 1 in 20 patients survive for 5 years or longer after diagnosis. This is in part due to late detection: symptoms are unspecific and often occur only when the disease has already progressed to advanced stages, so that diagnosis if often too late for therapeutic intervention (surgery and/or chemotherapy). This makes the earlier detection of pancreatic cancer an important goal in mitigating the disease, yet no approved non-invasive or minimally invasive, inexpensive tests currently exist.

We studied a Spanish population of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, the most common form of pancreatic cancer) and clinically matched controls that were either pancreas-healthy or suffered from chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas, an important risk factor for the development for PDAC). We found that a set of 27 microbial species detected in feces provide a very specific signature for PDAC patients, even in early stages. When combined with a blood serum-based cancer progression (not diagnostic) marker, prediction accuracy increased even further. We confirmed this finding in an independent German cohort, and also made sure that this microbiome signature did not falsely predict PDAC among thousands of subjects that were either healthy or suffered from other diseases. Moreover, we were able to trace some of these signature microbes between mouth, pancreatic healthy tissue, pancreatic tumors, and the gut which suggests that they may be more than just indicators.

Our study is freely available online in the journal GUT (Kartal, Schmidt, Molina-Montes, et al; 2022): https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2022/01/26/gutjnl-2021-324755

A commentary by R. Newsome and C. Jobin in the same issue puts our work into context: https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2022/02/21/gutjnl-2021-326710

For less formal introductions, check the press releases by one of our funding bodies ([Worldwide Cancer Research](https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/news-opinion/2022/march/microorganisms-in-stool-samples-could-offer-new-way-to-detect-pancreatic-cancer-early/)) or the lead institutions [EMBL Heidelberg, Germany](https://www.embl.org/news/science/an-international-study-proposes-stool-analysis-for-early-detection-of-pancreatic-cancer/) and [CNIO Madrid, Spain (text in Spanish)]( https://www.cnio.es/noticias/una-colaboracion-internacional-propone-un-analisis-de-heces-para-la-deteccion-temprana-del-cancer-de-pancreas/).

Our work is an early proof of principle and will need to be further validated on larger and independent cohorts. Yet our findings hold some promise for a future inexpensive, non-invasive screening method for pancreatic cancer. Such a screen could initially target risk groups, e.g. above a certain age or with a family history of PDAC. Ideally, with further development and in combination with other biomarkers, our approach might be developed into an actionable diagnosis method in the future. That said, none of us is a medical doctor; we cannot and will not provide any medical advice, and none of what we post here should be construed as such.

We will be on at Noon Eastern (16 UT), and are looking forward to your questions, AUA!

I'm Dr. Alex Schnell, a Research Fellow from Darwin College at the University of Cambridge. I'm a comparative psychologist interested in the behaviour and mental processes of animals. More specifically, I investigate learning, memory, and self-control in mainly cephalopods (e.g. octopuses and cuttlefish). My findings have contributed to our understanding of the evolution of complex cognition and how certain cognitive abilities may have arisen independently in invertebrate taxa. 2021 was a productive year. Two of my papers showing that cuttlefish have both [self-control](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.3161) and what's termed []""episodic-like"" memory](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.1052) were the [Royal Society's fifth-](https://twitter.com/RSocPublishing/status/1475451741298728968) and [sixth-most](https://twitter.com/RSocPublishing/status/1475089076143468545)-talked-about papers, respectively. [Watch VIDEO of cuttlefish pass the ""marshmallow test"" here!](https://youtu.be/m0CZ6quPyls)

I was also part of a team at the London School of Economics and Political Science that reviewed the evidence of sentience (the capacity to experience emotions) in both cephalopods and decapods (e.g. crabs, shrimp, lobsters). [Our central recommendation](https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/Latest-news-from-LSE/2021/k-November-21/Octopuses-crabs-and-lobsters-welfare-protection), which is now being implemented, was to include both these groups of invertebrates in the UK Sentience Bill. This means, for the first time, these groups will be protected under animal welfare law.

My career purpose has been to further our understanding of the remarkable behaviours of animals in the hope that I might inspire more people to appreciate the incredible wonder of animal life on Earth. When people understand nature, they are more motivated to preserve it, research shows.

I joined the University of Cambridge as a Visiting Researcher in 2016 and became a Research Fellow in 2018.  Prior to Cambridge, in 2007, I obtained a B.A. in Marine Science at the University of Sydney. In 2015, I completed my Ph.D. on the behavioural ecology of giant cuttlefish at Macquarie University. I then held several post-doctoral positions with my experimental research based at a leading cephalopod research facility, the Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts. My postdoctoral research focused on different aspects of cuttlefish cognition including perception, learning, and memory. I also won a prestigious Grass Fellowship in Neuroscience, a program that supports early career researchers to bridge the gap between neuroscience and behaviour. I've also worked as a BBC series researcher for Planet Earth III and Life of Mammals II, and my work was featured in a [NOVA PBS digital documentary on YouTube](https://youtu.be/m0CZ6quPyls). Most recently, I worked for Wild Space Productions and Freeborne Media to produce a major new series for Netflix entitled 'Oceans.' My aim in these roles was to highlight new findings on animal behaviour to give the public a new dimension for understanding wildlife. I'll be on in the afternoon (ET), AMA!

Molecular Engineering is a new field; we were one of the first Molecular Engineering graduate programs in the world, and one of only two in the United States. Though MolES only opened in 2014, we have had many discoveries to share!

Molecular engineering itself is a broad and evolving field that seeks to understand how molecular properties and interactions can be manipulated to design and assemble better materials, systems, and processes for specific functions. Any time you attempt to change the object-level behavior of something by precisely altering it on the molecular level - given knowledge of how molecules in that ""something"" interacts with one another - you're engaging in a type of molecular engineering. The applications are endless! Some specific examples of Molecular Engineering research being done within the labs of the MolES Institute are:

1. MolES faculty member and Chemistry professor Al Nelson developed a new way to produce medicines and chemicals and preserve them in portable, modular ""biofactories"" embedded in water-based gels known as hydrogels. This approach could enable access to critical medicines and other compounds in low-resource areas.
2. The Baker lab in MolES and Biochemistry is engineering artificial proteins to self-assemble on a crystal surface. The ability to program these interactions could enable the design of new biomimetic materials with customized chemical reactivity or mechanical properties, that can serve as scaffolds for nano-filters, solar cells or electronic circuits.
3. Bioengineering/MolES Institute Professor Kelly Stevens developed a new 3D printing approach to create biocompatible hydrogels with life-like vasculature - opening the possibility of printing living human tissue for things like organ replacement!
4. Researchers in MolES and Chemical Engineering professor Elizabeth Nance's lab are attempting to deliver therapeutics to the brain using tiny nanoparticles that can effectively cross the blood-brain-barrier in brain injury and disease.
5. MolES PhD student Jason Fontana is working in the labs of James Carothers and Jesse Zalatan to develop tools that facilitate genetic engineering in bacteria for optimizing biosynthesis of valuable products.

Molecular engineering is recognized by the National Academy of Engineering as one of the areas of education and research most critical to ensuring the future economic, environmental and medical health of the U.S. As a highly interdisciplinary field spanning across the science and engineering space, students of Molecular Engineering have produced numerous impactful scientific discoveries. We specifically believe that Molecular Engineering could be an exciting avenue for up-and-coming young scientists, and thus we would like to further general awareness of our discipline!

Thank you so much for your time and attention! We are scientists from the Department of Human Genetics at the University Of Miami Miller School Of Medicine. Our department is the 2nd largest recipient of NIH funding for Genetics Research, and we investigate a wide range diseases using the latest sequencing technology and other cutting-edge methods that have helped us understand the human genome in new and unexpected ways. From better understanding developmental conditions to improving personalized cancer treatments, the future of genetics is incredibly exciting and hopeful.

Please let us know any questions you have about the current state or future of genetic research or medicine (EXCEPT PERSONAL HEALTH QUESTIONS OR ADVICE), and we have 3 faculty who have volunteered their time to give their perspectives. Our department is committed to the paramount need for including diverse populations in genetic research, and we hope that engaging with everyone here will help us better connect with the communities we serve.

Here today starting at 3:30PM EST (20:30 UT) are three researchers from the University of Miami, ask us anything!

**Dr Karen Nuytemans, PhD Bio:**

Dr. Nuytemans is a Research Assistant Professor in the John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics and the Dr. John T. Macdonald Foundation Department of Human Genetics. She received her PhD from the University of Antwerp in Belgium after which she came to University of Miami, initially as a post-doctoral Fellow, before advancing to her current position. Her research focuses on the genetics of neurodegenerative brain disorders. She has extensive experience working with 'big data' datasets including genotyping and next generation sequencing data, for the identification of common and rare genetic variants in disease. Dr. Nuytemans is specifically interested in Parkinson's Disease (PD) as well as Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, should have access to personalized medicine. That is why including these disorders across diverse populations in genetic research is one of her main research foci.


**Dr Susan Halloran Blanton, PhD Bio**

Dr. Blanton received her PhD in Human Genetics from Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia. She obtained post-doctoral training in Biostatistics (University of Pittsburgh) and Population Oncology (Fox Chase Cancer Center). Her primary research has focused on the mapping of genes for Mendelian and complex diseases; she has been instrumental in studies identifying over twenty genes/loci for Mendelian disorders. Stroke and the underlying genetics of its risk factors, deafness, retinal diseases, skeletal dysplasias, cleft lip/palate, and clubfoot are among the diseases which she currently studies. She collaborates with Drs. Sacco, Wright and Rundek to identify genetic factors influencing white matter and cognition and their relation to ageing. In addition, she has been involved in developing and implementing genetic education materials for Federal and appellate level judges and science writers in an ELSI sponsored project. Dr. Blanton is the Executive Director of the Hussman Institute for Human Genomics as well as the Associate Director of Communications and Compliance. She is an Associate Professor in the Dr. John T. Macdonald Foundation Department of Human Genetics.

Michael L. Cuccaro, Ph.D., Director of the Patient and Family Ascertainment Division in the Center for Genomic Education and Outreach at the John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics, is a clinical psychologist who specializes in understanding the interplay between genetics and behavior across development. His work reflects this specialization with a focus on cognitive and behavioral disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, dementia, and intellectual disability. His research concentrates on the development of behavioral methods to construct and extend clinical phenotypes of individuals with these and related disorders to optimize gene discovery. Further, he is working to improve recruitment and enrollment strategies to broaden opportunities for underserved populations to participate in genetic research. In addition, as part of his involvement with the Genetics Pathway for medical students, Dr. Cuccaro is involved in studies of medical trainee and professional attitudes about the utility of genomic information in healthcare.

In a study published last week in Science Advances, our interdisciplinary team of researchers found, to our surprise, that cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid produced by the cannabis plant, can prevent replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in human cells in a dish, and that mice who are pre-treated with CBD shower lower rates of infection when exposed to the virus. We also looked at real-world data collected from patients who were taking a medically prescribed CBD solution for the treatment of epilepsy and found that they tested positive for COVID-19 at significantly lower rates than similar patients who were not taking CBD. All together, we feel this provides compelling evidence that CBD could be a prophylactic treatment to prevent COVID-19, or even a treatment that could be used in the early stages of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We are now hoping to launch clinical trials on the topic.

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/or5p3q/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxv/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

This ""groundlink"" connected students with NASA's analog crew members from the Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA)  mission who lived in isolation on Earth,  and in environments with similarities to areas on distant planets!  Our team members are here to discuss mental health, behavioral health and how they are preparing to live on Mars!

So are we! We are scientists and artists who use a variety of artistic media to create works of art that showcase microbiology in our world. Some of us use combinations of microbes ""painted"" on nutritional agar; others use more traditional artistic platforms like drawings and photography to express our ideas. What we have in common (other than our love of microbiology and art) is that we are all winners of the American Society for Microbiology's 2021 [Agar Art Contest](https://asm.org/Events/ASM-Agar-Art-Contest/Home)!

The [American Society for Microbiology](https://asm.org/) has organized this annual contest since 2015, inviting scientists, artists, and anyone with an interest in the intersection of science and art, to create and submit their microbial artwork. This is a rugged competition: each year there are hundreds of entries from around the world that are narrowed down through two rounds of expert judging to identify the winners.

Join us today for a discussion about our individual artistic inspirations and creative processes. We'll answer your questions about how to turn microbes (and microbial ideas and concepts) into works of art. We'll be jumping on from 2 - 4 PM ET (7 PM - 9 PM UTC). Ask us anything!

With us today are:

So, I always just assumed that it was like, Jupiter, Saturn, etc have normal sized moons relative to themselves, and we (Earth) are the weird one, with an unusually large moon, proportionally speaking.

But, I was thinking about it, and how small of a sample size of planets we have at hand here in our solar system, and, maybe even more importantly, how small of a sample size of planetary systems we have up close and personal that we are inside of (just 1, that is... our own), so, that got me wondering:

Do we know anything about the relative sizes of the moons of the planets of other planetary systems?

Like, could it be that maybe it's the other way around, and it's not us that has the weirdly big moon, and instead, it's that planets as big as Jupiter and Saturn are ""supposed"" to have much larger moons than the ones they have in our Solar System right now?

Or, maybe somewhere in between, like, Earth's still is a little unusually large, but not by as much as one might assume, and, Jupiter/Saturn's moons are a little on the small size, but not to too severe of a degree, or something like that?

Occam's razor figures it to be more likely that we really do just have a weirdly big moon here, orbiting Earth, given even just the medium-low ish sample size of Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune's largest moons vs our moon, to take at hand as what we (up until pretty recently, anyway) had to work with, from a statistical standpoint and just guessing based on that, in and of itself.

So, I figure most *likely* the answer (if there is an answer available as of yet - not sure how good our data is on extra-solar moons so far) is going to be ""nope, ours is indeed strangely large""

But, I figured given the small-ish sample size and dynamics at hand here within our Solar System, there's still enough of a chance that maybe that's not the case, that I should still ask about it, just in case it isn't.

So yea, how much (if anything) do we know about the moons of the planets of other planetary systems, especially in regards to their relative sizes relative to said planets?  I know we can see the wobble-effect the planets have on other stars near us, to guess at the size of the planets orbiting said planet.  But, have we been able to notice anything (at all) in regards to moons?  (I figure it's a longshot, but I might as well ask).

Also, getting away from the empirical side of things, too: what about on the theoretical side of things?  Is there anything ""theory-wise"" (about how our Solar System formed, or how we think the early phases of planetary systems function) that might lead our hunches one way or the other in regards to this question, even if we didn't have any hard data on the moons of other planetary systems?",True,False,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,21559685,public,self,"Relative to the moons in other planetary systems, is our moon really unusually big relative to Earth, and Jupiter/Saturn/etc's moons are normal relative to them, OR, (maybe?) is our moon relatively more normal-proportioned to us, and, say, Jupiter's moons are unusually small for it?",0,[],0.43,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/rc7gn0/relative_to_the_moons_in_other_planetary_systems/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have a very basic yet bugging question about water boiling at different temperatures depending on different pressures.

We know that in a vacuum chamber water starts boiling before it reaches 100 degrees Celsius. The same phenomenon happens if we boil water at sea level versus doing if on a high mountain. 

That is, the lower the pressure before it starts boiling.

Again, I beg your pardon for this question as I intuitively understand it is extremely basic and possibly silly, but why we use pressure cookers then? Their function is to raise the pressure, thus making the water boiling faster. 

What am I understanding wrong? If their function was to raise the boiling point so as to cook the food at higher temperatures, that would be consistent with all the rest. However how come pressure cookers start boiling faster?

&gt;the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size (as opposed to tensile strength which withstands loads tending to elongate). In other words, compressive strength resists compression (being pushed together), whereas tensile strength resists tension (being pulled apart).

What's the difference? It seems like both are the same thing - a measure of how resistant to being compressed something is - and yet, substances like [aluminum oxide (Al2O3)](https://www.azom.com/properties.aspx?ArticleID=52) have drastically different values for bulk modulus and compressive strength.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21273660/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21273660/)

From the above (in vitro) study: *""...In the present study, we found that some neurosteroids in a concentration-dependent manner inhibited CRH gene promoter activity in the differentiated Neuro-2A cells. Among investigated neurosteroids, PGL \[pregnenolone\], the main precursor of steroid hormones, exerted the most potent effect. ALLO and THDOC, two potent endogenous positive modulators of the GABA receptors had only a little weaker inhibitory effect than PGL on CRH activity. It is likely that the inhibitory effect of ALLO and THDOC on CRH gene transcription may be implicated in the mechanism of their anxiolytic action.""*

Many of its symptoms are easily noticed, like gait, balance, tremor, and speech. But others are not visible to the naked eye - like fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and pain - and make day-to-day life with the disease difficult to navigate for the more than two million people living with MS globally. Today from 11a - 2p ET (16-19 UT), Patricia Coyle, MD and Patricia Melville, RN join us to take your questions about the invisible symptoms and disease related to MS.

[MS Team Meeting: The Impact of the Invisible Symptoms of MS](https://www.psychiatrist.com/ms-team-meeting-the-impact-of-the-invisible-symptoms-of-ms/) is a new four-part video series featuring Coyle and Melville for [The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry](https://www.psychiatrist.com/). Watch as they share an in-depth conversation with Lillian, a woman with MS for the past 30 years who shares a candid account of life with this disease.

Patricia K. Coyle, MD is the director of the MS Comprehensive Care Center and professor of neurology at Stony Brook Neurosciences Institute.

Patricia Melville, RN, NP-C, CCRC, MSCN is a supporting specialist at Stony Brook Neurosciences Institute.

WBE uses wastewater (aka, sewage) sampling to track public health at a population level with geographic specificity. While it has been around for decades, wastewater surveillance really entered primetime as a [tool for tracking the spread of COVID-19](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/9/21-0753_article#r6). By detecting cases before symptoms emerge, wastewater surveillance can act as an [early warning system for outbreaks](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestwater.1c00050) and even [variant detection](https://www.bio-rad.com/featured/en/wastewater-variant-surveillance-for-sars-cov-2.html), helping local organizations and governments keep ahead of the curve.

In the U.S., the CDC and HHS created the [National Wastewater Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/surveillance/wastewater-surveillance/wastewater-surveillance.html) (NWSS) to monitor community spread. Similar efforts have cropped up around the world including the Sewage Analysis CORe group Europe ([SCORE](https://score-cost.eu/)) and the Global Water Pathogen Project ([GWPP](https://www.waterpathogens.org/)). Many of the resulting studies can be visualized using the [COVID-19 WBE Publication Map](https://www.covid19wbec.org/publication-map).

At this point, you may be wondering: How on earth can scientists detect trace amounts of a virus in municipal wastewater? The average American uses [approx. 82 gallons](https://www.epa.gov/watersense/statistics-and-facts) of water at home every day! Despite this volume, tools like Droplet Digital PCR allows scientists to detect [one infected individual in 10,000](https://www.bio-rad.com/featured/en/wastewater-surveillance-for-sars-cov-2.html), as many as six days before they would test positive via a nasal swab.

There are so many more techniques, programs, and applications (incl. tracking other infectious diseases, drug use, etc.) possible with WBE. We can speak to topics such as:

+ The history of wastewater testing and how wastewater surveillance works
+ How wastewater surveillance has helped track COVID-19 outbreaks
+ The technology that makes it possible, [including ddPCR](https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/feature/wastewater-surveillance-for-sars-cov-2.html)
+ The overall research landscape surrounding WBE and its future applications
+ Other general questions about WBE challenges, science policy, infrastructure, overall execution, and beyond

Feel free to start sharing your questions below. We'll be answering them live today (11/30) starting at 5:00 p.m. EDT (2 p.m. PDT, 22 UT).

Bernice and Michael [have spent years reporting on the U.S. meatpacking industry](https://www.propublica.org/series/on-the-line), while Irena used her background in bioinformatics to track salmonella infantis, a dangerous strain that's sickened tens of thousands of people, including some who died, in the past few years. Other countries have all but eliminated salmonella in poultry, but in America, infantis has been allowed to spread and continues to make people sick. [The USDA knows about it. The meat industry knows about it. But the public? Not so much](https://www.propublica.org/article/salmonella-chicken-usda-food-safety).

Most people know that cooking poultry kills salmonella, but many studies found that cooks routinely cross-contaminate their kitchen surfaces after handling raw meats, which means that bacteria like salmonella are still a risk.

In addition to publishing a [huge exposé on the outbreak](https://www.propublica.org/article/salmonella-chicken-usda-food-safety), we also made [a database that lets anyone look up where their chicken or turkey came from, as well as how often dangerous salmonella was found](https://projects.propublica.org/chicken/) by USDA inspectors. We call it [Chicken Checker](https://projects.propublica.org/chicken/). In spite of the name, Chicken Checker also lets you look up turkey. Happy Thanksgiving.

I have been studying the world's most threatened mammals for more than 15 years across six of the seven continents.

I received a B.S. in Environmental Studies from [Emory University](http://envs.emory.edu/home/), a M.S. in Environmental Studies from [Yale University](http://environment.yale.edu/), and a Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolution from [Columbia University](http://e3b.columbia.edu/). I am currently a Research Faculty member at the [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/) leading carnivore research on the [Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve](https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/california/stories-in-california/dangermond-preserve/). I am also a [National Geographic Explorer](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/projects/explorers/rae-wynn-grant/), and a Visiting Scientist at the [American Museum of Natural History](http://amnh.org/).

My latest venture is a podcast from PBS Nature called ""[Going Wild with Dr. Rae Wynn-Grant](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/podcast/)."" In it I tell my stories from the field, from encountering giraffe poachers while tracking lion cubs in Tanzania, to discovering never-before-seen population of the world's most endangered lemur in Madagascar, to giving CPR to a hibernating black bear in Minnesota. My hope is to encourage the next generation of wildlife ecologists. Listen [here](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/going-wild-with-dr-rae-wynn-grant/id1583296781) or wherever you get your podcasts.

I've worked on archaeological sites around the world in Denmark, Germany, Greece, Syria, the United States, Madagascar, Easter Island (Rapanui) and the Outer Hebrides. I have been UK Archaeologist of the Year and am a Fellow of the British Academy. My research on Stonehenge over nearly 20 years has helped to transform our understanding of this enigmatic stone circle, including the discovery of a new henge, a settlement where Stonehenge's builders may have lived, and the quarries for Stonehenge's bluestones in the Preseli hills of west Wales. I've published 24 books on a wide variety of archaeological topics, but I really love being out doing fieldwork.

You can follow more of my recent work on PBS' [*Secrets of the Dead* episode](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/full_length/the-first-circle-of-stonehenge-q9ngn0), where my team and I painstakingly searched for the evidence that would fill in a 400-year gap in our knowledge of the site's bluestones. The episode reveals the original stones of Europe's most iconic Neolithic monument had a previous life before they were moved almost 155 miles from Wales to Salisbury Plain.

I am an assistant professor in the [Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/endocrinology) and Medical Oncology at the [University of Colorado School of Medicine](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/) and associate research professor in the Department of Human Physiology and Nutrition at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs.

I've also coached Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar to two consecutive Tour de France victories and I try to provide the most precise, scientifically-based training for athletes at the top of their game. But that's only part of it. I also work with elite athletes to better understand the intersection of metabolism and disease, and I've developed new insights into how regular exercise shapes our long-term health.

I'm here to talk about and take your questions on a variety of topics including:

+ What is metabolic health?
+ What's the relationship between exercise and cancer? Or Type II Diabetes and Alzheimer's?
+ Why is exercise the most powerful medicine in the world? And how can different exercises affect how our mitochondrial functions?
+ What kind of training do elite athletes do in order to perform their best?
+ What is the nutrition of a Tour de France winner?

My research is trying to help to identify the role that metabolism could play in the development of different diseases characterized by mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction.  I can elaborate on the connection between Type II Diabetes and Alzheimer's, as well as the role that lactate plays in cancer development. I can also explain the most effective form of exercise to maintain metabolic health and how fueling and exercise efficiency looks different for everyone

We'll be here today at 2 PM ET for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), about the present and future of STIs.

STIs are an enormous health issue. According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news/item/20-05-2021-new-report-highlights-global-progress-on-reducing-hiv-viral-hepatitis-and-sexually-transmitted-infections-and-signals-need-for-renewed-efforts-to-reach-2030-targets), there are approximately 1 million new infections daily worldwide, resulting in 2.3 million deaths every year. In the United States, [half](https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/factsheets/2018-STI-incidence-prevalence-factsheet.pdf) of new STIs occur among those ages 15-24. Meanwhile, increases in antimicrobial resistance are making it harder to treat and cure infections. STIs also represent a massive burden to the economy- in the United States alone, $16 billion is [spent annually](https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/prevalence-incidence-cost-2020.htm) on STI-related health care costs.

But it's not all bad news! Screening programs are increasing around the world, mother to child transmission rates of diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis and HIV are decreasing, and effective treatments are continuing to be developed and delivered to patients in need. Even better, new technologies, some of which were created rapidly as part of the national COVID-19 response effort, are making it easier for people to access routine sexual health maintenance services.

We're here to answer your questions and discuss causes and cures, as well as opportunities for improvements in diagnoses and prevention strategies. We'll also discuss the emergence of new diseases and how they can be contained.

PLEASE NOTE- WE WILL NOT BE MAKING PERSONAL DIAGNOSES OR RECOMMENDING TREATMENTS.

I'm Diego Pol, a paleontologist and National Geographic Explorer who studies dinosaurs and ancient crocs. For the last few years, I've been exploring and discovering dinosaurs in Patagonia, the southern tip of South America. I'm the head of the science department at the Egidio Feruglio paleontology museum in Patagonia, Argentina, and during the last ten years I've focused on the remarkable animal biodiversity of the dinosaur era preserved in Patagonia. My research team has recently discovered fossils of over 20 new species of dinosaurs, crocs, and other vertebrates, revealing new chapters in the history of Patagonia's past ecosystems.

My name is Christopher McCurdy, and I am a broadly trained pharmaceutical scientist and pharmacist whose research focuses on the design, synthesis and development of drugs to treat pain and drug abuse. My work with novel sigma receptor ligands has led to possible medication development that could ease the effects of cocaine, methamphetamine and pain. I'll be answering your questions on how Kratom helps those with opioid withdrawal syndrome and anything about my career as a pharmaceutical scientist.

My research interests at the University of Florida are:

+ Anxiety
+ Drug abuse
+ Drug addiction
+ Natural products

More about me: I received my Ph.D. in Medicinal Chemistry in 1998 from the University of Georgia. Since then, I have served as President of the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists and as a member the United States Pharmacopeial Convention. I also serve as an ad hoc member of the U.S. FDA Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee. Currently, I serve as director of the University of Florida's Clinical and Translational Science Institute Translational Drug Development Core that conducts bioanalysis, in vivo studies, human clinical trials, and more.

The main difference between his explanation and the common but erroneous one is that he makes the point that we should think of each photo taking every possible path through the medium (I think that's the Feinman path integral formulation, but please correct me if I'm mistaken) and _every_ atom absorbing and reemitting each photon, but he then says that ever individual atom has only a very small chance of doing this, but we'd expect it to happen at least some of the time because there are just so many atoms.

Even apart from that aspect, I would still expect to experience the pressure even if it's balanced. I understand that our bodies don't collapse (or at least squish a bit) because they're basically incompressible (cavities excepted), but I would still expect to feel it. According to Wikipedia the air pressure at sea level is around 1kg/cm^2, which is a lot, but I can pinch my arm with far less pressure than that and still feel it clearly.

If you've seen ""Fantastic Fungi"" on Netflix, you've gotten a good introduction to the world of fungi. But there's always more to love about fungi than psychedelic drugs.

Join us today starting at 2 PM ET (18 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, on all aspects of fungi. We work on a variety of projects, including:

+ Interactions between crunchy critters (arthropods) and fungi
    + Insects zombified by fungi
    + Fungi that millipedes eat
    + Insect killing fungi as biotechnology
    + Fungi that cause disease in bees
+ Fungal bacterial interactions and the fungal microbiome
+ Fungal diversity and applied mycological endeavors
+ Fungi and climate change

My team and I are working to uncover one of history's great mysteries. During WWII, the United States and Nazi Germany were competing to develop nuclear technology. The Allies thwarted Germany's program and confiscated 2 inch-by-2 inch uranium cubes that were at the center of this research. Where these cubes went after being smuggled out of Germany is the subject of much debate. Our research aims to resolve this question by using nuclear forensic techniques on samples that have been provided to us by other researchers, as well as on a uranium cube of unknown origin that has been located at our lab in Washington for years. I'll be on at 10:30am Pacific (1:30 PM ET, 17:30 UT) to answer your questions!

I've personally always found this odd because for me, red is very clearly the ""best"" color.  And I dont mean that as its the color I personally like best from an aesthetic point of view.  The best way I can describe it is that I can almost perceive red better than I can another color like blue.  It just seems so much more vivid.  

I've taken color blindness tests and what not and I believe I have ""normal"" color vision.  But I swear that the color red just always feels, in a sense, more real to me.

This came up with some friends recently when a scene in a movie came on where one character asked the other what their favorite color was.  He quipped back blue, and the original character pointed thats a lie because adults don't really have a favorite color.  It struck me as almost odd, and in talking with my friends more, I was surprised they didn't feel the same way as me.  

So I suppose my question really is...  are there any physiological or psychological differences that can cause someone to perceive a color very differently from other colors?

On board we have the remotely operated vehicle (ROV), Luso, the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Autosub6000, three benthic landers (a respirometer, baited camera, and baited trap), a multibeam bathymetry system, box corer, multicorer, a conductivity-temperature- depth (CTD) system, and the newly developed environmental DNA (eDNA) sampler named RoCSI (Robotic Cartridge Sampling Instrument). During the cruise we have used all this equipment to explore the deep sea through mapping, imaging, and sampling the seafloor and water column. We've seen cold-water corals, sponges, fish, sea cucumbers, anemones, mud and rocky substrate!

This cruise is part of the EU Horizon 2020 project [iAtlantic](https://www.iatlantic.eu/).

My name is Marc Moss, and for the last 20 years, I have been studying the effects of stress on critical care nurses and other healthcare professionals.

I'm also a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Head of the Division of Pulmonary Sciences and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and work as a critical care doctor.

Earlier this year, my colleague Dr. Meredith Mealer and I were honored to receive the American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACN) Pioneering Spirit Award for our work studying the effects of stress on nurses and creating interventions to increase resilience among healthcare workers.

Among these interventions includes work at the [Colorado Resiliency Arts Lab](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/coral/our-team), a research consortium supported by the National Endowment for the Arts. We are striving to create a vibrant, collaborative creative arts therapy community that is committed to enhancing healthcare professional well-being and alleviating psychological stress in the workplace and
beyond.

While I've been studying healthcare-related burnout for many years, this last year and a half during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a war zone for our healthcare professionals. I have never been prouder of all of my colleagues and the amazing hospital employees that we work with on a daily basis. They are working long hours in difficult conditions, putting on and taking off protective equipment, while trying not to get sick themselves, or infect their families and children. You would be honored to witness their extraordinary and relentless efforts to care for our sickest patients. However the relentless stress is taking its toll on all of us. I am afraid that the next wave will ""break our souls"".

In addition to critical care-related research, my research interests include identifying new treatment modalities for patients with the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and exploring the diagnosis and treatment of neuromuscular dysfunction in critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation.

So this question came to my mind, it might sound a bit obvious or silly but does this mean that all organic matter is unable to be decomposed or does wood resist the hindered bacteria because it's more resistant to decomposition than flesh?
Is the radiation in the high-risk zones high enough to kill all bacteria or enough that it renders all processes of organic decomposition impossible or not?

I think the risks associated with doing this are substantial, but there is poor oversight in some jurisdictions where melatonin is OTC, and I'm not sure what to believe about this.

Melatonin is found in a bunch of places: certain plants contain it, it can be synthesized from tryptophan, and of course it is contained in the pineal glands of mammals. Apparently, some melatonin supplements are derived from the pineal glands of cattle. This is worrisome, there are all kinds of risks associated with consuming this kind of thing and among those risks is CJD, the most common prion disease in humans. 

What I would like to know is whether this is still a common practice, and if not, when exactly did we stop doing this? All I can find on this topic is a few vague statements in various places along the lines of ""most melatonin is synthetic now,"" but this doesn't seem convincing to me. Adding to my skepticism is the fact that the quality among OTC melatonin supplements has been demonstrated to be terrible, with huge inconsistencies between stated dosages and actual dosages contained within the pills. I would not be surprised if all of the OTC melatonin continues to be produced in this very risky way given the very poor quality control. A convincing counterargument would be that synthetic melatonin is cheaper to produce than the animal-derived kind, but I have no way of estimating the margins either way here.

HGH derived from cattle brains has caused CJD in children who were administered it. This is a very real risk with melatonin as well if it is still being produced non-synthetically, hence my question. I'm not really sure that this question has a definitive answer, nobody can speak for every single supplement out there, so I suppose I'm asking more about the likelihood that this practice is widespread.",True,False,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,21137622,public,self,Is most melatonin produced synthetically?,0,[],0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/p82f2j/is_most_melatonin_produced_synthetically/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Did you know that imagining being touched activates the same brain maps that allow you to feel actual touch?

Here's some info about me: I have a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from MIT and study the developing brain as a postdoctoral scholar in the psychiatry department at Washington University in St. Louis. Together with colleagues Nancy Kanwisher and Chris Baker, I discovered and named a new brain area: the fusiform body area. I have been the chief editor of *Trends in Cognitive Sciences*, a scholarly reviews journal. I have also written a book about brain maps for the public called *[Brainscapes: The Warped, Wondrous Maps Written in Your Brain - And How They Guide You](https://smile.amazon.com/Brainscapes-Warped-Wondrous-Written-Brain_And/dp/1328949966/)* (Mariner Books, 2021). The book was supported by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Program for Public Understanding of Science and Technology.

You can find out more about the book from [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/books/review/brainscapes-rebecca-schwartzlose.html), [Publishers Weekly](https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-328-94996-7), the [Avid Reader Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqZZxUNTgOo), the [Smart People Podcast](https://www.smartpeoplepodcast.com/episode/377-rebecca-schwarzlose-how-your-brain-interprets-your-reality/), and my [author site](http://www.rebeccaschwarzlose.com/).

The improvements include increased editing efficiency enabling previously unfeasible large edits (1000s of base pairs) at a clinically viable level, in addition to lower cellular toxicity. Our Cas9-HR Platform represents an exciting step for gene editing.

We plan to use our Cas9-HR Platform to develop therapeutics, specifically treatments for genetic diseases that are caused by a diverse number of mutations. Since existing high-efficiency CRISPR technologies are limited to small edits (1-50 base pairs), we believe this is an area where we can make a significant impact.

+ Inflation: The mind-bogglingly fast expansion of the Universe in a fraction of the first second. It turned tiny quantum fluctuation into the seeds for the galaxies and clusters we see today
+ The Cosmic Microwave background: The radiation reaching us from a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang. It shows us how our universe was like, 13.4 billion years ago
+ Large Scale Structure: Matter in the Universe forms a ""cosmic web"" with clusters, filaments and voids. The positions of galaxies in the sky shows imprints of the physics in the early universe
+ Dark Matter: Most matter in the universe seems to be ""Dark Matter"", i.e. not noticeable through any means except for its effect on light and other matter via gravity
+ Dark Energy: The unknown force causing the universe's expansion to accelerate today
+ ""The Hubble Tension"": Measurements of the universe's expansion rate, which are almost identical but, mysteriously, slightly discrepant (aka the [sigh] ""crisis in cosmology"")

Let me introduce myself. I'm a chemistry professor, science entertainer, and author that uses a theatrical and hands-on approach to teaching, all while trying to inspire students across the world to fall in love with science. You may have seen me in a blue lab coat and red-bottomed heels on *The Today Show*, *The Kelly Clarkson Show*, *NBC Nightly News*, the *Wendy Williams Show*, the *Rachael Ray Show*, or *Late Night with Stephen Colbert*, where I try to make each explosion bigger than the last one. I travel the country collecting science advocates to be part of my STEM army, and we're working together to break down the image of the stereotypical scientist. Here's where 70 female scientists broke the record for the most thunderclouds at one time: https://thedailytexan.com/2020/02/10/kate-the-chemist-cbs-mission-unstoppable-show-taping/.

I've published seven children's books, including the bestseller [The Big Book of Experiments](https://www.amazon.com/Kate-Chemist-Big-Book-Experiments/dp/059311616X), and I cannot wait to hit the road next week to promote my new book [It's Elemental: The Hidden Chemistry in Everything](https://www.amazon.com/Its-Elemental-Hidden-Chemistry-Everything/dp/0778389421). In the book, I highlight the ways we experience chemistry in our everyday lives; starting with breakfast and an early morning workout, to going to the beach and then happy hour, and finally ending the day by analyzing the science in the bedroom. It's my first nonfiction book for adults, and I'm so excited to share it with you all!

Want to see some explosions? Check out my first visit to the Today Show (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W9DCSABs2U) or the time I scared the crap out of Stephen Colbert (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nELtaMKMP8o).

I've looked all over for an answer to this question, but can't seem to find an answer online that clarifies things for me. When describing the action potential, and the electrochemical gradient that forms it, I often see an ion as described as flowing down its respective concentration gradient. For example, during depolarization, sodium flows into the cell, from an area of high concentration to low concentration (of sodium). During depolarization, the same occurs, with potassium flowing out of the cell. All through selective ion channels of course.

My first issue is, how are these individual gradient physically justifiable? Isn't diffusion determined by the overall concentration of ions (since they are bouncing off each other and creating a ""pressure"" that is lower in an area of lower concentration)? Wouldn't the overall osmolarity be the only relevant factor?

My second issue come from what's probably a bad assumption. I did a bit of searching and found that the extracellular fluid has a higher osmolarity then the intracellular fluid in a neuron. That combined with the difference in charge of -70mV sort of explains the depolarization step and its eventual charge of +30mV. As part of the energy is derived from the difference is concentration, and the rest a difference in charge, I can see why depolarization would be spontaneous. It also explains to me why it ""overshoots"" and another +30mV of charge are produced across the membrane, as additional energy from the resolution of the concentration difference is ""stored"" as a positive electrical potential. My next issue is, if depolarization is spontaneous (based off of the assumption I made above), how does hyperpolarization occur to restore the membrane potential to an EVEN HIGHER negative voltage. How could this be spontaneous? With the lower osmolarity inside the cell, this makes little to no sense to me. I thought the energy might have come from the ATPase pumps in the cell membrane, but I've read that hyperpolarization is so fast, these cannot explain the restoration of the electrochemical gradient.

Could anyone tell me where my erroneous thinking is? Anyone have a good breakdown of how the action potential occurs?

Based on this [kurzgesagt video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFCbJmgeHmA), the reasoning given for why the larger marine animals became extinct was due to 97% of all plankton – the bottom foundation of the aquatic food chain – being killed off.

I tried Googling this and couldn't come across any research papers or discussions on the topic: **Had the asteroid hit somewhere else on the planet (ie. not a sulfur reserve), could the outcome of the K-T extinction been very different?**

Some additional thoughts that stemmed from this question:

* Had it hit somewhere else on the planet, could the impact – and the events that followed – have been more or less devastating?
* What were the chances that the asteroid impact could've been less destructive (and possibly not brought on the series of disastrous events that followed)?
* Had the asteroid not hit the sulfur reserve that caused a cloud of darkness around Earth, would the Earth have eventually been able to cool itself?
   * How much longer would this stage have lasted (vs. the relatively quick period of the cooling brought on by fallout)?
* Could the **lack of** a cloud that covered the Earth been potentially more devastating to life in the long run?
   * ie. Earth is stuck in a premoridial-type state for a longer period of time, stunting evolution's ability to grow more diverse life.

# TL;DR

What were the chances that this asteroid just so happened to hit where it did and cause a devastating chain of events that killed off most of the land-based species, as well as the marine life that followed soon after?

Today we released the Renewables 2021 Global Status Report so we're hosting an AMA to talk about renewables, energy, the future and everything in between.

Multiple people from the team are joining including:

+ Rana Adib (RA): our Executive Director and the one with the most experience in renewable energy - over 20 years.
+ Duncan Gibb (DG): produces the annual Renewables Global Status Report and is our go-to person for anything building or heating/cooling related.
+ Thomas Andre (TA): Research Analyst turned Director of Operations, Thomas is our expert in anything investment-finance-economy related.
+ Hannah Murdock (HM): coordinates the Renewables Global Status Report and is our policy and transport go-to person.
+ Lea Ranalder (LR): coordinates the Renewables in Cities Global Status Report so is our expert on anything cities related.

We'll be going live from 11am ET (15 UT), so ask us anything!

I understand that an aeroplane's wings generate lift by making the air travel a greater distance on top than on the bottom in the same amount of time, effectively increasing air velocity on the top, making for a lower pressure relative to the air pressure on the bottom.

I also know that at too high an angle of attack coupled with too low an airspeed, the air separates from the top surface of the wing.

Part of me understand that if there is no airflow, and therefore no faster airflow and lower pressure, on the top of the wing, lift will decrease. However, at the same time, if the plane is moving forward and the air is failing to make contact/follow the top surface, would that not in effect be creating sort of a vacuum would be at an even lower pressure than if there was fast airflow? Would that not in itself create more lift?

I addition, I know that gold balls aren't smooth because a smooth surface would cause the airflow to not follow the surface around the ball far enough back. This results in the trailing-side of the ball having a very low pressure which greater accentuates the force acting against the direction of the ball. Would this not apply to an aeroplane's wings, where the top of the wing is analogous to the trailing-side of a smooth golf ball?

I'm Kofi Asante, the head of strategy and business development at aerospace startup Elroy Air. [Elroy Air's mission](https://youtu.be/_V3oD7u5V6w) is to improve the quality of life around the world by expanding the reach of express logistics: We're currently building an autonomous vertical take-off and landing system that can deliver 300 pounds of cargo over a 300-mile range. While at Elroy Air, I've helped develop strategic partnerships with NASA, World Economic Forum, Air Force, Embraer, and many Fortune 500 corporations.

Prior to being here, I was a part of Uber's Advanced technology strategy group team that launched Uber freight. During my time at Uber freight, I built an Uber entity that I named ""[Powerloop](https://youtu.be/Uyr8WSJoLdg),"" which decreases wait time for drivers and enables high utilization for autonomous trucks. The division is now expanding nationwide, enabling drivers to seamlessly ""loop"" to their next load using their ""power"" unit. The program has helped thousands of drivers maximize their workday and come home early to their families all at the same time.

I currently serve as a venture partner and board member at FVLCRUM Private Equity Funds. I'm also a Venture Fund Advisor to Rackhouse Ventures and a board member at the Tufts Entrepreneurship Center. My ventures both at Uber and Elroy Air have been featured in the Wallstreet Journal, PBS, Techcrunch, Forbes, and Business Insider. Most recently, Elroy Air and I were featured in NOVA PBS' new film ""[Great Electric Airplane Race](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/great-electric-airplane-race/),"" which premiered on May 26. Ask me anything about Elroy Air, my work on ""Powerloop,"" my involvement in ""Great Electric Airplane Race,"" or my passion for science communication.

Ask me anything!

Duke, a Johns Hopkins and Yale-trained physician scientist and entrepreneur who's board certified in gynecology and obstetrics, and fellowship-trained in reproductive endocrinology and infertility (REI). I also have a PhD in virology. As America's only dual-accredited women's health fertility expert and virologist, I'm the physician founder and medical and lab director of the [Nevada Fertility Institute](https://fertilitynevada.com/about-us-2/) in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.

My extracurricular work includes outreach to women and girls to encourage and foster their continued interest in careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). I'm the host and producer of the 'Girl Powered Success &amp; Survival International' aka [GriPSSI Podcast](https://gripssi.libsyn.com/), which is aimed at highlighting the work and dynamic career paths of women and girls around the globe. I'm also the producer of informative online programs aimed at debunking myths surrounding fertility and infertility among men and women in the diaspora and those within the LGBT community. I'm also actively creating and curating information about COVID-19 for the general public. Recently, Dr. Aimee and I were featured in the NOVA PBS documentary ""[Fighting for Fertility](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/fighting-for-fertility/),"" which premiered on May 12 and can be [streamed on YouTube](https://youtu.be/TqJ9sp1_Tsk).

As a Physician Executive, I've served on a number of hospital boards. I'm also a contributor and member of the Women's Health Advisory Council (WHAC) for [Healthywomen.org](https://www.healthywomen.org/), a Medical Advisor for Proov, a member of the Medical and Scientific Advisory board for CONFIRMD by Buddy Cheque, and a member of the Forbes Business Council. I'm also the current Leader of the Las Vegas Chapter of the Society of Physician Entrepreneurs. Throughout my career I've been - and continue to be - the beneficiary of many outstanding mentors and role models. As a result, outside of my clinical work and research, I understand the value of giving back to my community, which I view as the global village. My hobbies include gardening, photography, baking, and writing poetry.

Hi, Reddit! I'm [Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh](https://draimee.org/about), a fertility specialist with my own practice in the San Francisco Bay Area. I specialize in IVF and have vast experience helping women over 35 realize their dreams of becoming a mother.

I graduated from UCLA School of Medicine and completed my residency in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology at Harvard Medical School. I also completed a fellowship in Reproductive Endocrinology &amp; Infertility and hold a Master's in Public Health Management and Policy from the University of Michigan.

A large part of my public health mission is to educate people about their fertility potential and remove the veil of mystery surrounding reproductive medicine and technologies. In the nearly 20 years since I completed my medical training in 2001, I've become well-known for my innovative approach to fertility care that begins with diagnosis before treatment. I've met many women in their 30s and 40s who have struggled with their fertility and wished they had known more about it when they were younger. In 2012, a patient inspired me to launch The Egg Whisperer, a three-step plan for fertility testing, consultation, and tracking. Then in 2014, I extended my mission to help educate and empower young people in their 20s and 30s about their fertility and better plan for their future families by starting her now well-known ""[Egg Freezing Parties](https://eggfreezingparty.com/)"" in San Francisco. Fertility can be a heavy topic, so I wanted to create a lighthearted and fun approach to fertility education and understanding fertility preservation options.

We'll be here at 4 PM ET (20 UT), ask us anything about our work in fertility, involvement in STEM advocacy work, or our involvement with ""Fighting for Fertility""!

We are the scientists behind a recent UN report on the impacts of methane emissions on climate change around the world. This report is called the Global Methane Assessment and you can download the whole thing [here](https://www.ccacoalition.org/en/resources/global-methane-assessment-full-report).

Here are the headline findings:

The Global Methane Assessment shows that human-caused methane emissions can be reduced by up to 45 per cent this decade. Such reductions would avoid nearly 0.3°C of global warming by 2045 and would be consistent with keeping the Paris Climate Agreement's goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.5˚C) within reach.

Because methane is a key ingredient in the formation of ground-level ozone (smog), a powerful climate forcer and dangerous air pollutant, a 45 per cent reduction would prevent 260 000 premature deaths, 775 000 asthma-related hospital visits, 73 billion hours of lost labour from extreme heat, and 25 million tonnes of crop losses annually.

We are:

+ Drew Shindell - Professor of Earth science at Duke University
+ Jean-Francois Lemarque - Director of the Climate and Global Dynamics (CGD) Laboratory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research
+ Johan Kuylenstierna - Research Leader at the Stockholm Environment Institute
+ Bill Collins - Professor of Climate Processes at University of Reading
+ Nathan Borgford-Parnell - Science Affairs Coordinator at the Climate &amp; Clean Air Coalition

Methane doesn't always get the attention that it deserves, so we were pleased to see the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/climate/methane-leaks-united-nations.html), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/urgent-methane-cuts-needed-rein-climate-change-un-says-2021-04-27/), [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56933443), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/06/cut-methane-emissions-rapidly-fight-climate-disasters-un-report-greenhouse-gas-global-heating) and many others highlighting our report - but now we're here to dive into the details.

It makes a medical decision without human oversight, and was based on decades of work in neuroscience and neural networks, design of diagnostic AI algorithms, and design of validation trials, in close collaboration with US FDA. This happened in 2018, and I did an AMA here at the time  here: https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/9d5id2/askscience_ama_series_im_michael_abramoff_a/

Since then, the success of Digital Diagnostics allows me to focus on the deep scientific questions around autonomous AI. What are the ethical issues and dilemmas around autonomous AI in healthcare, and how can we solve these to build an ethical foundation for autonomous AI. This framework then helps guide design, development, validation, regulation, liability issues, implementation and even reimbursement. Read more here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2020.02.022, and also in an the issue of the American Journal of Bioethics dedicated to our framework https://doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1819469

Given its almost infinitely scalability, autonomous AI has the potential to do good on a massive scale. Think of improving access, solving health disparities, address health equity issues, lowering cost of care, and improving care quality, to benefit patients is tremendous. At the same time, because the large scale in which it is deployed, it also has the potential to do harm. That is why it needs to be done the right way.

And, thanks to ethical frameworks, we have come far already: inclusion in clinical standards of care, a framework for autonomous AI medical liability, a methodology for autonomous AI's reimbursement incorporating massive cost savings, and most recently a Medicare reimbursement of $55 and more. The healthcare system was built around physicians, nurses, and other human healthcare workers doing ""stuff"". Research studies, peer reviewed publications, FDA approval, ultimately are not enough for changing in clinical practices. So all these steps, and many more, were necessary to get the results of the science of AI to benefit patients.

Now that the technology is real, other companies also have entered the autonomous AI field, we are getting ready to start a trial for a second autonomous AI, for skin cancers, it is time to do another AMA.

I am neuroscientist who started studying neural networks to mimic brain function over 30 years ago. I am also a practicing retina specialist - a physician who specializes in ophthalmology with a fellowship in vitreoretinal surgery -; and a computer scientist, with a MS in Computer Science about artificial neural networks, and a PhD in 2001 on ""AI"" of medical images.

I am founder and executive chairman of Digital Diagnostics, and hence have conflicts of interest. You may also know me as one of the original developers of ImageJ, a widely used open-source image analysis app. I have published over 300 peer reviewed journal papers (h-index 66) on AI and retina, and am inventor on 17 patents and 5 patent applications in this area.

Because my statements are often under FDA, FTC, or CMS oversight and scrutiny, my answers may then seem unnaturally constrained - I will try to explain when that is the case.

I'll be in and out for a good part of the day, AMA!

We're the six scientists profiled in the Reuters [Hot List series](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/climate-change-scientists/), a project ranking and profiling the world's top climate scientists. We'll be around for the next several hours to answer your questions about climate change and more. A little more about us:

[Michael Oppenheimer](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/climate-change-scientists-oppenheimer/), Professor of Geosciences and International Affairs at Princeton University: My [research and teaching](https://scholar.princeton.edu/oppenheimer) focus on climate change and its impacts, especially sea level rise and human migration. My research group examines how households and societies manage the impacts of sea level rise and coastal storms, the increasing risk these bring as Earth warms, and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase adaptation and limit the risks. We also model the effect of climate change on human migration which is a longstanding adaptation to climate variations. We project future climate-driven migration and analyze policies that can ease the burden on migrants and their origin and destination communities.

[Corinne Le Quéré](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/climate-change-scientists-lequere/), Royal Society Professor of Climate Change Science at the University of East Anglia in the UK: I conduct research on the interactions between [climate change (ePDF)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0797-x.epdf) and the carbon cycle, including the drivers of [CO2 emissions (ePDF)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01001-0.epdf) and the response of the natural carbon sinks. I Chair the French High council on climate and sit on the UK Climate Change Committee, two independent advisory boards that help guide climate actions in their respective governments. I am author of three IPCC reports, former director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research and of the annual update of the global carbon budget by the Global Carbon Project.

Overall, humans are remarkably similar at the genomic level - two unrelated people share about 99.9% of their DNA sequences. However, the small percentage that does differ can hold important genetic clues about our traits and health. Important discoveries in human genetics and genomics often rely on comparing groups of people, for example people with a given disease compared to people without the disease. These studies utilize genomic data from individuals who have contributed their DNA for research purposes, most of which (approximately 80%) are individuals of European ancestry, yet 16% of the global population is made up of people of European ancestry. The failure to include some populations in genetic studies means researchers are likely missing discoveries that can benefit everyone, and results can have limited utility across different populations.

 We're here to discuss the [2021 DNA Day Essay Contest question](https://www.ashg.org/dna-day/), which asked high school students around the world to address how population representation impacts genomic findings and whether inclusion of more diverse populations in genetic and genomic studies holds a potential to benefit future genetic research and improve human health.

Some groups who are working to improve population representation in genetic and genomic research include:

+ The Human Heredity and Health in Africa Initiative (H3Africa), which is collecting genetic samples from participants in 27 African countries, as well as funding African investigators working in African institutions.https://h3africa.org/index.php/about/
+ The Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Consortium, which will genotype approximately 50,000 individuals from non-European populations. https://www.pagestudy.org/
+ The All of Us Research Program, which plans to recruit one million American individuals - at least half of whom are of non-European ancestry - to learn more about how differences in lifestyle, environment, and genetics influence health and disease. https://www.joinallofus.org/

The American Society of Human Genetics is a partner in organizing today's AMA. For more information on human genetics and genomics, check out their Discover Genetics page: https://www.ashg.org/discover-genetics/. And, for more information on this year’s Essay Contest question, check out this fact sheet: https://www.ashg.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DG_FactSheet_PopRepresentation_v5.pdf

Our group today includes:

+ Marina DiStefano, PhD (u/Marina_DiStefano) - I am an assistant professor and clinical molecular geneticist in the Geisinger Precision Health Program and an affiliate member at the Broad Institute. I lead the Broad-based ClinGen biocuration team and work with multiple Consortiums to develop and set standards for curation data available to the public.
+ Claudia Gonzaga-Jauregui, PhD (u/cgonzagaj) - I am a geneticist working on rare, undiagnosed, and Mendelian diseases. I identify the molecular causes of genetic disorders to provide diagnoses and novel genes association. I am particularly interested in studying genomic variation in diverse and underrepresented populations to improve community and population precision health and reduce disparities.

Yet, many pose a hazard to human health and the environment, which means it's more important than ever to create safer, more sustainable alternatives.

We're exploring new applications for bio-based solvents, such as Cyrene™ - a dipolar aprotic solvent that is derived from cellulose and produced in one step from levoglucosenone (LGO), a versatile chemical building block. This solvent can be used for the production and development of active pharmaceutical ingredients, the engineering of plastics and the manufacturing and recycling of electronic components.

In addition to determining new applications for Cyrene™ solvent, we're also working on further developments for other LGO derivatives. These next-gen solvents can play a crucial role in more sustainable chemistry. For example, when compared to N-methyl-2-pyrrolione (NMP) and dimethylformamide (DMF), two solvents under increasing regulatory restrictions due to their toxicity, Cyrene™ solvent offers superior performance in some applications. Additionally, its low toxicity falls well below the hazard thresholds defined by the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals.

I'm Dr. Diwakar Davar, a physician-scientist at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center and the University of Pittsburgh.

Despite the success of cancer immunotherapy only about 30-40% of patients have a positive response. We want to know why! And, we think the gut microbiome may hold some of the answers.

There are billions of bacteria in the gut. In fact, the gut microbiome has been implicated in seemingly unconnected states, ranging from the response to cancer treatments to obesity and a host of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, depression, schizophrenia and autism.

Together with my Hillman and Pitt colleague Dr. Hassane Zarour, we looked at the success and failure of cancer immunotherapy and discovered that cancer patients who did well with anti-PD1 immunotherapy had different gut bacteria microorganisms. So, what if we could change the gut bacteria? What if we transplanted the good bacteria from those who responded to treatment into the patients who did not respond? In a small first-in-human trial, we found that this just might work! A tremendously exciting finding.

What does this mean for the future of cancer treatment? We think altering the gut microbiome has great potential to change the impact of immunotherapy across all cancers. We still have a way to go, including getting more specific with what microbes we transfer. We also want to ultimately replace FMT with pills containing a cocktail of the most beneficial microbes for boosting immunotherapy.

Hey Reddit, happy National Robotics Week!

These days, robots are not just fodder for 1980s Styx songs. Nor are they always famously featured in TV shows or movies, like Rosie from The Jetsons.

At the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, robots are the workhorses that help our scientists advance energy storage and bioenergy research.

For example, robotic platforms are integral to helping us investigate and develop materials for energy storage applications to bolster modernization of the nation's grid.  These robotic partners help our scientists do more experiments with significantly lower labor and material costs than if conducted manually. They also allow us to effectively test formulations - literally thousands of them - for the most optimal materials conditions.

In the bioenergy realm, robots housed in our [High Throughput Center](https://www.pnnl.gov/high-throughput-center) handle routine and repetitive tasks and empower our researchers to investigate materials while accelerating understanding and production of biofuels and bioproducts. With the robots' help, multiple experiments can run in parallel, helping us perform hundreds more experiments than with manual methods.  One catalyst testing instrument can reduce four months of research to just two weeks.  Additionally, one sample preparation robot can produce more than 200 formulations in a single day, something that would take a researcher a full week to do - not to mention keeping track of it all, often with greater accuracy and precision, while avoiding repetitive strain injury.

Our research in grid energy storage and bioenergy is typically supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's [Office of Electricity](https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity) and [Bioenergy Technologies Office](https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy), respectively.

We ""bot"" you think all this robot talk is cool! We sure do.

Come ask us questions about our cool energy storage and bioenergy breakthroughs and how our robots are helping. We will be back at noon PDT (3 PM ET, 19 UT) to answer your questions!

We build liquid computers that run on chemistry, instead of electricity. Using these chemical computers, we program non-biological matter to grow, heal, adapt, communicate with the surrounding environment, replicate, and disassemble.

The same switches that make up your laptops and cell phones can be implemented as chemical reactions [1]. In electronics, information is encoded as high or low voltages of electricity. In our chemical computers, information is encoded as high or low concentrations of molecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, and other chemicals). By designing how these components bind to each other, we can program molecules to calculate square roots [2], implement neural networks that recognize human handwriting [3], and play a game of tic-tac-toe [4]. Chemical
computers are slow, expensive, error prone, and take incredible effort to program... but they have one key advantage that makes them particularly exciting:

The outputs of chemical computers are molecules, which can directly bind to and rearrange physical matter.

Broad libraries of interfaces exist [5] that allow chemical computers to control the growth and reconfiguration of nanostructures, actuate soft robotics up to the centimeter scale, regulate drug release, grow metal wires, and direct tissue growth. Similar interfaces allow chemical computers to sense environmental stimuli as inputs, including chemical concentrations, pressure, light, heat, and electrical signals.

In the near future, chemical computers will enable humans to control matter through programming languages, instead of top-down brute force. Intelligent medicines will monitor the human body for disease markers and deliver custom therapeutics on demand. DNA-based computers will archive the internet for ultra-long term storage. In the more distant
future, we can imagine programming airplane wings to detect and heal damage, cellphones to rearrange and update their hardware at the push of a button, and skyscrapers that grow up from seeds planted in the earth.

Currently our society is drafting a textbook called The Art of Molecular Programming, which will elucidate the principles of molecular programming and hopefully inspire more people (you!) to help us spark this second computer revolution.

We'll start at 1pm EDT (17 UT). Ask us anything!

We're Dr. Christopher Bell, Associate Professor and Director of the Integrative Biology Lab at Colorado State University, and Keith Woelfel, Director of R&amp;D at Caliper Foods, and we just published the first peer-reviewed investigation of consumer CBD product pharmacokinetics. The study was [published](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/14/1/35) in a special edition of the Medical Journal [Pharmaceuticals](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals) entitled [Cannabidiol: Advances in Therapeutic Applications and Future Perspectives](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals/special_issues/cannabidiol), and was approved by Colorado State University's Institutional Review Board (IRB) in compliance with the requirements of [45 CFR 46](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=83cd09e1c0f5c6937cd9d7513160fc3f&amp;pitd=20180719&amp;n=pt45.1.46&amp;r=PART&amp;ty=HTML) for human clinical research.

Pharmacokinetics (PK) is the science of how bioactives diffuse through the body, and it reveals the difference between what we consume and what we absorb (vs. what we excrete), as well the rate and efficiency of absorption. PK studies are critical to understanding the efficacy of any bioactive compound, including CBD, since a bioactive's effect is a function of its presence. In other words, you can't feel what you don't absorb. PK studies provide the scientific foundation for claims such as ""fast acting,"" ""long lasting,"" and ""superior bioavailability.""

To date, when CBD product manufacturers have claimed fast action or superior absorption, they have generally based those claims - to the extent they've predicated them at all - on mouse studies or analogies to non-cannabinoid bioactives (often curcumin). Caliper's study represents the first human clinical substantiation of such claims, as well as the first to do so using commercially available products and an IRB-approved study design. Moreover, with the CBD industry generally mired in fraud and mistrust enabled by the prominent absence of Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) oversight or enforcement over the past four years, this study is unique in its academic integrity. Although Caliper provided funding for the study, Colorado State University exercised complete and independent authority over the collection, analysis, and publication of these results.

Conducted by Colorado State University researchers, this study compared the pharmacokinetic
profiles of three proprietary soluble CBD formats - Caliper Powder, Caliper Quillaia-based Liquid Concentrate, and Caliper Gum Arabic-based Liquid Concentrate - against two control formats: oil-based CBD tincture and unemulsified CBD isolate, which together power the [majority (pdf)](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/3324860/NFD-TheCBDReport-ES-092018.pdf) of available consumer CBD products in use today. The blinded, randomized, [crossover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study) study design involved 15 healthy men and women, ages 21-62, each consuming 30 mg of CBD in each product format. Participants provided venous blood samples prior to ingestion, and then at regular intervals over the ensuing four hours. Blood analysis revealed that all of Caliper's product formats were absorbed significantly faster than either control:

+ Caliper Powder, which is used in Caliper's flagship consumer offerings, [Caliper CBD](https://trycaliper.com/product/caliper-cbd/) and [Caliper Swiftswticks](https://trycaliper.com/product/caliper-swiftsticks/), delivered CBD into the bloodstream 142 times faster than isolate, and 22 times faster than tincture, in the 30 minutes following ingestion, based on a comparison of observed circulating blood levels of CBD.
+ Caliper Gum Arabic-based Liquid Concentrate (SKU: T-L-A-5), which is used by [Caliper
Ingredients](https://caliperingredients.life/)' customers to power a variety of beverage, food, and supplement products, delivered CBD into the bloodstream 424 times faster than isolate, and 64 times faster than tincture, in the 30 minutes following ingestion, based on a comparison of observed circulating blood levels of CBD.
+ Caliper Quillaia-based Liquid Concentrate (SKU: T-L-Q-20), which is used by Caliper Ingredients' customers to power a variety of beverage, food, and supplement products in the natural foods channel, delivered CBD into the bloodstream 218 times faster than isolate, and 33 times faster than tincture, in the 30 minutes following ingestion, based on a comparison of observed circulating blood levels of CBD.

Thanks for having me here. I'll be here from 12pm to 3pm PT today (3-6 PM ET, 19-22 UT). My latest research on bullying (with coauthors Diane Felmlee and Cassie McMillan) was based on the idea that teens use aggression to gain social status in their school and tried to identify the most likely targets for their cruelty. To the extent that bullying is used this way, adolescents are likely to target their own friends and friends-of-friends, for these are their rivals for desired social positions and relationships.

We indeed found that, compared to schoolmates who are not friends, friends are four times as likely to bully each other, and friends-of-friends are more than twice as likely to do so. Additionally, ""structurally equivalent"" classmates - those who are not necessarily friends, but who share many friends in common - are more likely to bully or otherwise victimize each other. Our research received some [attention and commentary on r/science](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/lnd42g/teens_who_bully_harass_or_victimize_peers_are/) so I'm here to answer your questions about bullying, frenemies, and why prevention programs have not been successful--AMA!

We are here to answer any questions any of you have to do with science or technology and how they affect your life. There are no silly questions - ask us anything and we will try to give an easy-to-understand answer and, wherever possible, provide some further sources to enable you to do your own research/reading.

Our goal is simply to advance everyone's understanding of science, engineering and technology and to help people be better informed about the issues likely to affect them and their families.

**More info / Longer read:** CSES is a registered charity in the UK, founded in 1920. We're a volunteer group of over 250 members and our key strength is our diversity and interdisciplinary expertise. Our members come from a variety of educational, social and economic backgrounds, from industry and academia and a multitude of age groups, representing groups from the millennials all the way to the Silent Generation (our oldest member being 97)!

There has been growing dis-information globally in the last 20 years. Today's global interconnectedness, while being hugely beneficial for making information easily accessible to everyone, has made it ever more difficult to determine 'truth' and who to trust. As an independent charity, not affiliated or biased to any particular group, but with broad knowledge we are here to answer any questions you may have and to hopefully point you to further reading!

Our goal is simply to answer as many of your questions as we can - but we aren't able to give advice on things - sorry! We will also be clear where what we are saying is the experience-based opinion of someone in our team.

CSES will draw from its large pool of volunteers to answer your questions, however the people standing by to answer comments are:

+ Vic Leverett OBE: 40 years' engineering experience with previous director-level positions Europe's largest defence/engineering companies. Honoured by The Queen with an OBE for services to engineering and defence.

A large body of research has demonstrated a strong association between the gut microbiome and mental health. Microbes have been associated with neurological disorders ranging from degenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS and dementia) to mental health disorders (like depression and anxiety) that are becoming all-too-prevalent in today's society. Recent reports have even indicated that, similar to many other flu-like diseases, SARS-CoV-2 may also be impacting brain health. However, there is still much that we don't understand about how these relationships are established or maintained.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (19 UT) for a discussion with experts on what is being called the ""psychobiome"", organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). We'll discuss what we know about the relationships between microbes and hosts, how these relationships impact our behavior, moods and mental capacity, and what each of us can do to strengthen the health of our microbiomes, and, ultimately, improve our mental health.

I’m Dr. Diwakar Davar, a physician-scientist at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center and the University of Pittsburgh.

Cancer immunotherapy, which uses the body’s own immune system to fight tumors, has forever changed how we treat cancer. But despite its success across many types of cancers, only about 30-40% of patients respond to immunotherapy. If we find out why this happens, we can help more people benefit, either by developing new therapies or choosing patients that are more likely to benefit from existing treatments.

The gut microbiome has been implicated in seemingly unconnected states, ranging from the response to cancer treatments to obesity and a host of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, depression, schizophrenia and autism. Recent research including my own has suggested that species and relative populations of microbes in our gut have been linked to the success and failure of multiple cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and cancer immunotherapy.

Together with my Hillman and Pitt colleague Dr. Hassane Zarour, we asked if we could identify and use fecal microbiome transplants (FMT) to alter the gut microbiome of cancer patients who had previously failed to respond to anti-PD1 immunotherapy and convert them into responders. In a small first-in-human trial, we found that this was indeed the case, a tremendously exciting finding. What does this mean for the future of cancer treatment? We think altering the gut microbiome has great potential to change the impact of immunotherapy across all cancers. We still a ways to go, including getting more specific with what microbes we transfer. Ultimately, we want to replace FMT with pills containing a cocktail of the most beneficial microbes for boosting immunotherapy—but
there’s still a lot of work to do before we get there.

I have read somewhere that in video gaming, playing in higher resolution lessens the strain on the CPU, because the GPU gets busier. So for instance, if you have a very good graphics card, but an ancient CPU, it makes more sense to game in 3840x2160p rather than 1920x1080p.

&amp;#x200B;

Is that right? If so, why? Why would a higher resolution take away strain frim the CPU? I understand the graphics card gets busier, but why would that make it easier for the CPU?

Say a rocket moves away from Earth at 99% the speed of light and I then shine a laser towards that rocket. Once that laser catches up to the rocket, will it be observed to travel at 1% the speed of light since we are already moving at 99% the speed? I understand that the speed of light remains constant for everyone but if we observe it to travel at 100% the speed of light from the rocket, doesn't that mean that it is technically moving faster than the speed of light? I know my last point isn't true but I'm just having a hard time wrapping my head around the concept of light speed remaining constant regardless of your speed.

As far as the sciences go, this is less of a hard science question than it is a soft science question for the most part (as in, relating to things like anthropology, sociology, etc.), though there's probably a physics application to the question too since we're talking with different frames of reference with regard to time.

Sci-Fi stories with multiple planets still do the ""X years/months/weeks later"" transition, even though planets of different sizes and rotations would have different calendars and would measure time differently. Considering the delivery of things like messages, goods, etc. is important--vital, even--for the functioning of a stable society, and since these things are all dependent on a common understanding of time, how would this actually work when entirely different yearly calendars and day cycles are used?

Like, I can't wrap my mind around it. The closest point of comparison I can think of is the delivery of packages across different time zones here on Earth, which would mean that time zone differences would need to be taken into account, but that's just on a scale of hours and minutes, which are the same for everywhere. When you're talking travel to other planets, which have day/night cycles of varying hours which are different from Earth's 24-hour cycle, to say nothing of the adjustment of their respective calendars which could have more or less months than Earth itself, and that's not even getting into the ***seasons,*** let alone the fact that time would also be measured differently during the trip in space due to relativity.

So how would we keep it consistent? What system would we use? It seems like a small thing, but considering the non-zero possibility of humanity leaving Earth to form permanent settlements elsewhere due to either exploration or lack of resources (assuming the species doesn't eradicate itself first), this strikes me as a pretty huge logistical problem (at least, as long as we're assuming that human society is continuous across the solar and extra-solar colonies--I suppose that if each planet were isolationist and kept to themselves, this would be far less of an issue).

What im wondering is: if a vaccine with a weakened virus just triggers a complete immune response and it follows by immunity, just not the severe symptoms that come with the infection, why does it differ from the natural immune response from having a full infection? I mean, it should be the same protection for both natural infection and weakened virus vaccines, if im assuming the same mechanisms are in action, shouldnt it?

I am Tel Aviv University cancer biologist, Prof. Neta Erez. I study the tumor metastasis microenvironment.

Tumors are more than just a bunch of cancer cells. They are better described as multicellular organisms. In each tumor there are complex interactions with immune cells, which cause inflammation processes in the connective tissue and blood vessels.

In my lab, we study these interactions to understand how tumor cells ""hijack"" physiological pathways and use them to support their growth. Additionally, we also study the link between cancer and inflammation,specifically how cancer cells metastasize and grow in distant organs from their original host.

Prof. Erez studies the biology of tumor metastasis, focusing on the metastatic microenvironment, cancer-related inflammation and the role of stromal and immune cells in facilitating the early and late stages of metastasis. Prof. Erez's work focuses on these crucial aspects of cancer. She uses mouse models of carcinogenesis and metastasis of melanoma, breast, and ovarian carcinoma. The main goal of her research is to identify and characterize key molecular pathways in the communication between tumor cells and their microenvironment that can be targeted by novel therapeutics.

Prof. Erez began her academic career at the Weizmann Institute of Science. She obtained her PhD in the field of molecular cell biology under the guidance of Prof. Varda Rotter.  Supported by a fellowship from the Cancer Research Institute (CRI), Prof. Erez carried out her postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Prof. Doug Hanahan at UCSF, working in the field of tumor biology (2005-2010). During her postdoctoral fellowship she demonstrated a novel role for cancer-associated fibroblasts in mediating tumor-promoting inflammation. Following her postdoctoral work, she joined the Department of Pathology at the Sackler Faculty of Medicine in October 2010, and currently serves as the Department Chair.

I will be on at 10am PT (1 PM ET, 18 UT), Ask Me Anything!

It could be psychosomatic, of course, but I’m still curious, why does the shot hurt more when it’s real? Is it just because the body’s immune response is *that* fast? I figured the pain was a normal response to the skin being pierced and to having a shot, but if that’s the case then both the real deal and the control would hurt the same amount.

for the long list. Once I started reading up about radon and cancer, more questions kept popping up. I'm hoping somebody here is in the know and can answer some!


1. If radon is radioactive, and leaves radioactive material in your body, why does it mainly (only?) cause lung cancer?


2. If radon is 8x heavier than air, and mostly accumulates in the basement, wouldn't that mean that radon is a non-issue for people living on higher levels?


3. [This map](https://www.env.go.jp/en/chemi/rhm/basic-info/1st/02-05-07.html) shows radon levels around the world. Why is radon so diverse across a small continent like Europe, yet wholly consistent across a massive country like Russia? Does it have to do with measuring limitations or architecture, or is the ground there weirdly uniform? 


4. If radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking, why doesn't the  [map](https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/28/10/1563.figures-only)of worldwide lung cancer cases coincide with the map of most radon heavy countries?  It seems to coincide wholly with countries that smoke heavily and nothing else. I base this one the fact that if you look at second chart, which is lung cancer incidence in females, the lung cancer cases in some countries like Russia, where smoking is much more prevalent among men, drop completely. Whereas lung cancer rates in scandinavia, far and away the most radon heavy place on earth, are not high to begin with.

If you take a H1 blocking antihistamine (allergy medication), would this not lead to an “increase” (more that’s around than normal, not activating the H1 receptors) and so lead to an increase in activation of the H2 receptors, and so increasing stomach acid production?


I struggle with allergies and heartburn, so I am just wondering if there is any correlation with taking antihistamines, and heartburn.

I'm not worried about that, because each of these new variants don't seem to fully bypass any of the vaccines yet. What I am worried about is some variants being reported as more lethal, for example the UK and California ones.

Basically: does it take some time for an ovary to recover after a chemical pregnancy? Thus making it more likely you will ovulate off the opposite side in the cycle following the loss?

So backstory as to how I started wondering... I’m 27 and started my cycle at 9. Since I was 13, I’ve been able to feel my ovulation (Mittelschmerz). 

However it is almost always on my right side! I’ve also had two pregnancies with early scans that confirmed I had ovulated off the right side to conceive them. 

In December I had a chemical pregnancy. In January I felt unable to confirm ovulation (I don’t temp) because I did not feel that pain. I ended up with a positive test about a month after my chemical started. 

Now I’ve had an 8 week scan on that pregnancy and the tech told me I ovulated off my LEFT!!! perhaps that explains why I didn’t feel it?

Thus, I've often wondered if quantum coherence and decoherence should really just be referred to as something like ""disentanglement"" and ""re-entanglement"" respectively, since using the term ""coherence"" almost seems to imply that an *isolated* quantum system which is NOT entangled with its environment is somehow the default, when apparently it takes very special conditions to avoid triggering decoherence. 

I've recently learned (if I'm not misunderstanding it) that superfluid helium-4 is a macroscopic quantum-coherent phenomenon, i.e. once cooled enough, the helium atoms are described by one wavefunction. So would it be accurate to say that, prior to cooling, the helium atoms were entangled with the state of the beaker, the room, the building outside, etc, and once cooled, they're ""disentangled"" and form a singular quantum object discrete from the environment? Is this a correct use of terminology? I know this is more of a language question than a science question, but that's often where I trip up in discussions of quantum mechanics.",True,False,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,20484467,public,self,Is superfluid helium-4 disentangled from its environment?,0,[],0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ls5p14/is_superfluid_helium4_disentangled_from_its/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But apparently it can also “speed up” when passing from a dense to a less dense medium? How is this possible? Where does the energy for acceleration come from?

Or is it related to how I perceive faces?

There have been many times when I see someone and in my head I think they have a “common” face, as in, they share a lot of features and/or a similar composition of those features to a lot of other people I’ve seen. I don’t recognise the person, or think they look average. It’s that they just have ‘one of those faces’ that I see a lot.

 I’m wondering if this is actually a thing that has been studied on a genetic level, whether certain sequences of dna are more typical than others, or if it may be more or a neurological thing related to how I process faces and interpret/recognise them.

If it helps, I also don’t see identical twins as being fully identical. I think they look VERY similar but they always look different to me. This could be related if its neurological rather than an actual biological phenomenon.

I am Lalasia Bialic-Murphy, a Senior Scientist in the Crowther Lab at ETH Zurich and an Adjunct Research Assistant Professor at the University of Tennessee Knoxville. I study the importance of species interactions and abiotic resources (e.g., soil nutrient and water) in shaping the local abundance and geographical distribution of plant populations. I am particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms that drive species rarity and extinction in a changing world. I was also a field biologist for over 12 years, doing rare species management and critical habitat monitoring in Hawai'i. Understanding how on-going environmental change is affecting native ecosystems is critical for developing informed conservation efforts, and this is my passion. Ask me anything. I would also love to hear your experiences and perspectives on these topics. Let's talk!
+ [Iris Hordyck](https://twitter.com/CrowtherLab/status/1359143835117486083), Doctoral Candidate - /u/IrisHordijk
I am a third year doctoral student in the Crowther lab, ETH Zürich. My research focusses mainly on global tree species diversity and the relationship with forest functioning. I am interested in the patterns of tree species abundance, what drives species dominance and rarity, and how do dominant species influence forest productivity. Besides, I am passionate about tropical forest ecology and I am involved in a pan-tropical project on forest regeneration with fieldwork in Mexico. Ask me anything you would like to know related to academic life or my research!  
+ Niamh Robmann, Data Scientist - /u/nima-rob
After my bachelor's degree in Biology where I was mainly interested in anthropology and ecology, I decided to study bioinformatics &amp; computational biology for my master's degree.
I ended up doing my master's thesis in the Crowther lab where I was able to combine my interest in ecology and the newly learned tools and knowledge from my master's study program. Now I am working as a Data Scientist in the lab trying to support the group by adding my more data focused perspective.
+ [Kenza Amara](https://twitter.com/CrowtherLab/status/1359172764440158209), Doctoral Candidate - /u/k-amara
I am majored in Computer Science and applied mathematics, and chose to apply my technical skills to environmental issues. So, I decided to pursue a Master 2 in Environmental sciences, because I feel very concerned by climate change. I did my Master Thesis at Crowther Lab, which enabled me to work closely with the department of Computer Science at ETH. I will start my PhD in Computer Science in September but I hope to keep close contact with Crowther Lab and its amazing members!
+ [Nina Van Tiel](https://twitter.com/CrowtherLab/status/1359504948107558914), Data Scientist - /u/mountain_goat_11
With a background in bioinformatics and a strong infatuation for coding, I wanted to use my skills to contribute to fighting climate change. Although there is not much fighting in my daily routine, I support projects that strive to understand global ecology and inform responsible ecosystem restoration, for example, by writing efficient code and running machine learning models. I am a feminist with a particular interest in intersectional, eco-, and trans-feminism.

According to [this article in The Week](https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2020/05/05/french-hospital-retests-old-samples-discovers-covid-19-case-from-december.html), French scientist re-tested samples from pneumonia patients at a hospital and got a positive match as early as December 27, 2019.

Italian scientists found COVID samples in sewage from as far back as Dec 18, 2019 in Milan and Turin [according to this abstract on medrxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.20140061v1).

In [another medrxiv abstract](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.20140731v1) Brazillian researches report detecting COVID in two sewage samples in Santa Catalina/Florianopolis as early as November 2019.

[According to this Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-spain-science-idUSKBN23X2HQ), scientist from the University of Barcelona testing old sewage samples got a match for COVID-19 as early as *March 2019*.  

Many of these dates far pre-date when the virus was identified in these countries. Some of them pre-date when the first discovery of the virus in China!

My most recent *NOVA* special is a mini-series called ""[Beyond the Elements](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/beyond-elements/),"" a sequel to my 2012 documentary ""[Hunting the Elements](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/hunting-the-elements/),"" which has become a staple in science classrooms worldwide. The new show's three one-hour episodes take me on a worldwide quest for the key molecules and chemical reactions that make up human civilization, including concrete and fertilizer, plastic and rubber, fire and venom, explosives and hot peppers.

I've written or cowritten more than 120 books, including dozens in the Missing Manual tech series, which I created in 1999; six books in the *For Dummies* line (including *Macs*, *Magic*, *Opera*, and *Classical Music*); two novels (one for middle-schoolers); my three bestselling *Pogue's Basics* books of tips and shortcuts (on *Tech*, *Money*, and *Life*); my how-to guides *iPhone Unlocked* and *Mac Unlocked*; and my 620-page magnum opus, *How to Prepare for Climate Change*.

of people have now been vaccinated against SARS-COV-2 and new vaccine candidates are being approved by countries around the world. Yet infection numbers and deaths continue rising worldwide, and new strains of the virus are emerging. With barely a year's worth of clinical data on protections offered by the current batch of vaccines, numerous questions remain as to just how effective these different vaccines will be in ending this pandemic.

Join us today at 2 PM ET for a discussion with vaccine and immunology experts, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). We'll answer questions on how the current COVID vaccines work (and what the differences are between the different vaccines), what sort of protection the vaccine(s) offer against current, emerging and future strains of the virus, and how the various vaccine platforms used to develop the COVID vaccines can be used to fight against future diseases. Ask us anything!

But from my understanding, SARS-CoV-2 attack vector is the upper respiratory system, where it enters our body from floating droplets in our airways through the nose and mouth.  The droplets then settle on the tissue inside of our airways and the infection begins there.  Is my visualization of how that works correct?

If such is the case, the virus is initially hitting ""exterior"" cells, because it is touching the cells that line your airway, so they are hitting a ""wall"" of cells in your nose and throat and beyond that wall is just a cavity filled with air.

So how do the antibodies neutralize the virus in this situation?  If the virus is not ""inside"" our body floating around in our blood stream.  

I'm curious to know the mechanics of this or if I'm just totally wrong about how all of this works.

- How does the amino acid fold into the exact conformation of the spike protein as found on wild SARS-COV-2? Can't the amino acid chain fold in any number of possible ways? I thought that how you get an amino acid chain to fold a certain way (rather than another) was one of the fundamental challenges in understanding protein folding.


- Now that the finished spike protein is floating around in the cytoplasm of the cell, why and how does it migrate to the outside of the cell membrane? Why doesn't it just stay inside the cytoplasm? Are there cellular mechanisms in place that identify the protein as something the cell can't use, and in doing so, transport molecules bring the protein to the outside of the cell membrane... rather than destroying the protein while it's in the cytoplasm?


- Why does the spike protein then imbed itself into the outside of the membrane, rather than be ejected outwards into intercellular space?

It says:  

&gt;Based on communication principles, the maximum signal bandwidth in wireless communication is about 5% of the carrier frequency. Therefore, the higher the carrier frequency, the greater the signal bandwidth. That’s why, among the millimeter-wave frequencies, 28 GHz and 60 GHz are the most promising frequencies for 5G. The 28 GHz band can provide an available spectrum bandwidth of up to 1 GHz, while each channel in the 60 GHz band can provide an available signal bandwidth of 2 GHz (a total available spectrum of 9 GHz divided between four channels).  

I'm assuming this is in the context of frequency modulation.  

But I'm confused about the link between signal bandwidth and better speed or lower latency. Reading Wikipedia, signal bandwidth is defined as the difference between highest and lowest frequency. Why is having this being higher an advantage?

So molecular tests are least effective when you first show symptoms, however other studies find people are most contagious during the first five days. “A study published yesterday in The Lancet Microbe shows that COVID-19 is most contagious in the first 5 days after symptom onset” (Source 2).

&amp;#x200B;

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is \[here\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hwnhe2/askscience\_panel\_of\_scientists\_xxiii/](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hwnhe2/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxiii/)).

&amp;#x200B;

The panel is an informal group of redditors who are \*\*either professional scientists or those in training to become so\*\*. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

&amp;#x200B;

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*You are eligible to join the panel if you:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,

&amp;#x200B;

\* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Instructions for formatting your panelist application:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

\* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

\* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

\* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an example application:

&amp;#x200B;

Username: /u/foretopsail

General field: Anthropology

Specific field: Maritime Archaeology

Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction. 

Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.

Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.

&amp;#x200B;

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

&amp;#x200B;

The Eastern and Western gorillas are exactly the same with the exception of noises and sounds they use to communicate. They can even breed with eachother and create healthy, 100% functional offspring. These, however, are considered completely different species by biological standards.

&amp;#x200B;

Humans, however, have much larger differences. While skin color is the largest and most notable difference, and I imagine would be enough to classify as different species, there are also notable differences in lung capacity, bone density, skull shape, heart size, height, muscle, intelligence, blood type, susceptibility to disease, and significant hormonal differences. Blacks and Whites even hit puberty at different ages, with Blacks hitting puberty 2 years before Whites. There are even populations in SE Asia who can stay underwater for several minutes longer than any other population, Tibetans can survive in extreme elevations, etc. There are entire classes that crime scene investigators have to take where they can pinpoint with extreme accuracy the race of a skeleton.

&amp;#x200B;

Certainly, if gorillas are different species because of how they communicate, then humans are different species because of hundreds of differences which we are discovering more and more of every year.

I understood the concept of vapor pressure, but here is my question if in a room there is a pressure of 1 atm, hence boiling will occur ony at 100 degree celcius, could there be vapor in the first place to talk about vapor pressure?

So I am trying to understand the leading strand and lagging strand of DNA synthesis. I keep confusing the prime ends, and my brain just can't fully wrap my head around it.

From my understanding, the leading strand of DNA runs 5’ prime to 3’ prime and is synthesized continuously in the same direction of the replication fork. The lagging strand, however, runs 3’ prime to 5’ prime and is synthesized in fragments in the opposite direction of the replication fork.

From developing technology to aircraft concepts to flight testing, we're working toward a new generation of aircraft with a lower carbon footprint.

+ We built and tested a lithium-ion battery pack that uses Space Station technologies to improve safety and reliability - already being used in other experimental aircraft!
+ We've doubled the temperature capability of soft magnetics for flight electronics.
+ We will soon be flight testing the all-electric X-57 Maxwell Experimental Aircraft in a 2-motor, 150 kW mode followed by a 14-motor, 300 kW flight test on a high-performance wing.
+ We are using what we learn on experimental aircraft and in laboratories to help write the design and test standards for electric propulsion system in future passenger aircraft.
+ We can't wait to answer your questions on how we're turning this idea from science fiction to reality.

Participants include:

+ Cheryl Bowman, Deputy Branch Chief for High Temperature and Smart Alloys
+ Sean Clarke, Principal Investigator, X-57 Maxwell Experimental Aircraft and Advanced Systems Development Engineer

In addition, preliminary clinical trial data about the successful performance of other candidates has also been released. While these announcements have caused great excitement, a certain amount of caution and perspective are needed to discern what this news actually means for potentially ending the worst global health pandemic in a century in sight.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (19 UT) for a discussion with vaccine and immunology experts, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). We'll answer questions about the approved vaccines, what the clinical trial results mean (and don't mean), and how the approval processes have worked. We'll also discuss what other vaccine candidates are in the pipeline, and whether the first to complete the clinical trials will actually be the most effective against this disease. Finally, we'll talk about what sort of timeline we should expect to return to normalcy, and what the process will be like for distributing and vaccinating the world's population. Ask us anything!

according to fermi's golden rule, the transfer rate will be something like (2pi/hbar)\*B\^2\*p(E2). There's coupling between states, so the population transfer can happen.

Now, E2\_prime is not E2, but state 2 is more similar to state 2\_prime than to state 3\_prime.

This has led to permafrost thawing, which has big implications since permafrost currently covers 24% of the earth's landmass. Many of these permafrost layers contain ancient microbes that haven't seen warm air in hundreds or even thousands of years. This leads scientists to wonder what microbes will ""wake up""? And what will happen when they do?

I'm Dr. Kimberley Miner and I study how the changing climate impacts the most extreme environments in the world. My research explores the risks of climate change from more fires to hurricanes to flooding. But I also research microbes, which is an important area of climate change risk we rarely discuss. I co-authored this recent piece in Scientific American called, ""Deep Frozen Microbes are Waking Up.""

The telescope has been part of a world-class research facility in radio astronomy, planetary science, and atmospheric science. Among it's many contributions to science, the telescope was used in the discovery of the [first binary pulsar system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulse%E2%80%93Taylor_binary), [ice on Mercury](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/jpl/news/msg20121129.html), the [first exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1257%2B12), and the first [repeating Fast Radio Burst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst#FRB_121102). It has been used to track hundreds of Near-Earth Asteroids with its [planetary radar system](https://www.naic.edu/ao/scientist-user-portal/planetary-sciences), surveyed [Galactic](https://sites.google.com/site/galfahi/) and [extragalactic](http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/index.php/) Hydrogen, discover new [pulsars](http://www2.naic.edu/alfa/pulsar/) (at [different frequencies](http://www.naic.edu/~deneva/drift-search/), too), and open up the [low-frequency gravitational wave window to the Universe](http://nanograv.org/).

A number of users of the telescope who study a wide number of topics decided to come together to answer your questions today about the Observatory and the science it has pioneered, and share our stories of the telescope and Observatory. We encourage other friends of Arecibo to share feel free to share their stories as well.

+ Megan is a pulsar astronomer who works on pulsar searching and timing toward the goal of detecting gravitational waves. Much of her pulsar research has been done using Arecibo thanks to its world-class sensitivity. She was a summer student at Arecibo, and has fond memories of that summer, subsequent visits to the observatory, working with the telescope operators and staff, and teaching others how to use the telescope.
+ Michael J has been working with Arecibo for over 8 years. As part of the ALFALFA team (Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (Arecibo L-band Feed Array)) he has worked on performing a census of the hydrogen gas in galaxies, and how the gas content of galaxies varies with their surrounding environment. Cool (100s to 1000s of Kelvin) hydrogen gas spontaneously emits a very faint radio signal with a wavelength of about 21 cm (or equivalently 1420 MHz). Extremely sensitive radio telescopes such as Arecibo are capable of detecting this signal from galaxies up to several hundreds of millions of lightyears away.
+ Michael L is a professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology and is also a pulsar astronomer working towards the detection of gravitational waves. The observations of those pulsars also allow us to understand the turbulent electrons in the interstellar medium, and the telescope's capabilities have contributed significantly towards those goals. He first visited Arecibo as part of their single-dish summer school in 2009, and has been observing with the telescope himself since 2013.
+ Luke has also been a part of the ALFALFA team, in particular trying to understand ""almost dark"" galaxies that have lots of hydrogen but almost no stars. He has used Arecibo's sensitivity in addition to the high-resolution imaging of the Very Large Array and Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope to learn more about the strange properties of these galaxies.
+ Sean is a scientist in Arecibo Observatory's solar system radar group. He specializes in using radar data to find the shapes and other physical properties of near-Earth asteroids. Sean has been working with Arecibo radar observations since 2012, and he likes to say that part of his job description is defending the planet.
+ Nick has researched both Galactic and extragalactic atomic hydrogen and molecular gas with radio telescopes around the world, trying to understand the formation of structures in and around galaxies, He was part of the GALFA-HI (Galactic Arecibo L-band Feed Array HI) team, which has mapped neutral hydrogen in and around the Galaxy.
+ Flaviane is a scientist in the planetary radar science group at the Arecibo Observatory working with radar observations of near-Earth objects and asteroid deflection techniques to support planetary defense. Her first contact with Arecibo data was during her PhD back in 2013, using radar shape models to study orbital maneuvers around asteroids.   

All opinions are our own - we do not speak for the Observatory, the National Science Foundation, NASA, the University of Central Florida, etc. We will be answering questions at various times throughout the day, ask us anything!

Molecular Engineering is a new field; we were one of the first Molecular Engineering graduate programs in the world, and one of only two in the United States. Though MolES only opened in 2014, we have had many discoveries to share!

Molecular engineering itself is a broad and evolving field that seeks to understand how molecular properties and interactions can be manipulated to design and assemble better materials, systems, and processes for specific functions. Any time you attempt to change the object-level behavior of something by precisely altering it on the molecular level - given knowledge of how molecules in that ""something"" interacts with one another - you're engaging in a type of molecular engineering. The applications are endless! Some specific examples of Molecular Engineering research being done within the labs of the MolES Institute are:

1. MolES faculty member and Chemistry professor Al Nelson developed a new way to produce medicines and chemicals and preserve them in portable, modular ""biofactories"" embedded in water-based gels known as hydrogels. This approach could enable access to critical medicines and other compounds in low-resource areas.
2. The Baker lab in MolES and Biochemistry is engineering artificial proteins to self-assemble on a crystal surface. The ability to program these interactions could enable the design of new biomimetic materials with customized chemical reactivity or mechanical properties, that can serve as scaffolds for nano-filters, solar cells or electronic circuits.
3. Bioengineering/MolES Institute Professor Kelly Stevens developed a new 3D printing approach to create biocompatible hydrogels with life-like vasculature - opening the possibility of printing living human tissue for things like organ replacement!
4. Researchers in MolES and Chemical Engineering professor Elizabeth Nance's lab are attempting to deliver therapeutics to the brain using tiny nanoparticles that can effectively cross the blood-brain-barrier in brain injury and disease.
5. As a MolES PhD student in Valerie Daggett's lab, Dylan Shea studies the molecular events that occur in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease to better understand the structural transitions that take place in Alzheimer's-associated proteins. This knowledge will inform the development of diagnostic tests for early pre-symptomatic detection.
6. MolES PhD student Jason Fontana is working in the labs of James Carothers and Jesse Zalatan to develop tools that facilitate genetic engineering in bacteria for optimizing biosynthesis of valuable products.

Molecular engineering is recognized by the National Academy of Engineering as one of the areas of education and research most critical to ensuring the future economic, environmental and medical health of the U.S. As a highly interdisciplinary field spanning across the science and engineering space, students of Molecular Engineering have produced numerous impactful scientific discoveries. We specifically believe that Molecular Engineering could be an exciting avenue for up-and-coming young scientists, and thus we would like to further general awareness of our discipline!

I'm a biologist by training, and the author and editor of several books about science. I have written extensively on the teaching and the public understanding of evolution, genetics and nature of science. My research and writings are interdisciplinary, combining insights from science, history of
science, philosophy of science and psychology. I believe that scholars should do our society a service by serving as public intellectuals who educate non-experts on topics, and this is a contribution I would very much like to make through my books. Evolution is one of the most important ideas in science, yet evolutionary theory has been - and still is - hotly debated in the public sphere. But why do the debates about evolution persist, despite the plentiful evidence for it? Why do people find the idea of evolution hard to understand or accept? Why do some people think of evolution as a nihilistic idea that deprives life from meaning? These are the central questions of my new book
Understanding Evolution.

Ask me anything about:

+ evolution in the public sphere
+ evolution and religion
+ the conceptual obstacles to understanding evolution
+ the development of Darwin&amp;#39;s theory

&gt; A: Zanfel removes urushiol, the oil in poison ivy that binds to the skin and produces the symptoms of itching, redness, and swelling. Zanfel surrounds and removes the toxin from the dermal layers so that the body may immediately begin healing, and will no longer attack itself.

To shed more light on my question, I have a friend who tested positive for COVID antibodies over the summer (after presumably having an asymptomatic case at some point), had many negative tests over the past several months, and then tested positive for COVID on a PCR test again a couple weeks ago. Both times she was asymptomatic. Could this mean that the immune system is doing exactly what it’s supposed to do — i.e. the second time she got exposed, her body recognized the virus, fought it off, and she was never actually infectious? **That is, I assume “immunity” doesn’t actually prevent the virus from** ***entering*** **your body, but rather your immune system recognizes it and knows how to properly respond.** So can you have a true positive in this case because the virus has managed to make it into your system again and PCR tests are overly sensitive and will pick up on even a miniscule trace of virus? To get ahead of an answer I've already gotten: she has had many negative PCR tests between the positive antibody test and this most recent PCR test (she's someone who tests periodically as a precaution) so it seems less likely to me that this is one of those cases of someone consistently testing positive for months due to viral remnants.

That all said: **COVID aside, how does this work in a broad sense?** We don't test as frequently or with such high sensitivity for other viruses, but if we did, could an immune or vaccinated person theoretically have a virus ""in their system"" at a level high enough to test positive for it on a molecular test, but not be symptomatic or infectious because their body already knows how to fight it?

This would be hundreds of thousands of feet in practice, I don't know if it factors into the question or not.

Say the line is 100,000 feet long and it is expected to break with 10 lbs of (force? load? tension?), and the whole 100,000 foot length weighs 20 lbs.

My primary question is: **will the line break?**

More generally what I'm wondering is how the 10 lbs is distributed along the line.  Will the line break at the point where the weight of the line below exceeds 10 pounds?  Will it break at a random spot?  Will it not break at all because the 20 lbs is distributed evenly along the entire length of the line?

Is the answer different if there's a significant weight tied to the end of the line, say a 1 lbs weight or a 9 lbs weight or a 11 lbs weight.

I have studied and observed primates in the wild for 50 years, and in 2019 I became the first person to see at least one species from every one of the 80 genera of primates that are known to exist.  This is part of my ongoing effort over the past 20 years to stimulate primate ecotourism, and especially primate-watching and primate life-listing, based on a wildly successful birdwatching model.

The bulk of my career has been focused on primate conservation around the world, with the objective of maintaining the full diversity of the Order Primates and ensuring Zero Extinctions.  Ethical primate ecotourism has played a key role in our conservation efforts to date,  and I hope to enable it to become an even more significant part of our global program, with a strong focus on working closely with local communities living in close proximity to the world's most important primate habitats.  Local people are our most important partners in our conservation efforts and can benefit in many ways from successful primate ecotourism programs, as has already been demonstrated in many places. Primates are the most endangered larger group of mammals, with more than 60% of all known species now classed as Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable.

I am featured in the third episode of the *Natur*e ""[Primates](http://pbs.org/primates)"" miniseries, premiering tonight at 8/7c on PBS, [pbs.org/primates](http://pbs.org/primates), and the PBS Video app. This three-part documentary series visits 17 countries to uncover the mysteries of countless species, including gorillas, orangutans, lemurs, spider monkeys, marmosets, macaques and more. If you're in the UK, you can watch it on the [BBC iplayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hrg0/episodes/player).

So the mRNA from the vaccine codes for the spike protein of the virus which binds to ACE2, allowing for just the antigen to be produced, and then the T cell binds to the antigen to produce an immune response. 

So would the antigens produced also compete for ACE2? A concern is that they could block ACE2 from receiving its natural ligand, which might cause heart issues, as seen with Covid-19. Is this possible and how are they dealing with it? 

A possibility I thought would be a small enough dosage of mRNA to produce just enough spike proteins, but without producing significant competition to the natural ligand. 

Can anyone clarify/confirm on this? 

Also, the spike protein is a fusion type protein, so when the vaccine produced antigen attaches to ACE2 on cells, would it still illicit the same fusion response? Obviously there wouldn’t be another membrane to fuse with but would it cause the membrane to become porous? 

A possibility I thought about is if the mRNA codes for a mutated spike protein that does not cause fusion process, yet can still be recognized and used to cause an immune response by T cells. Or maybe the mRNA only codes for the S1 subunit of the spike protein, preventing the s2 fusion part? But then would T cells still be able to cause the desired immune response?

Any clarification or ideas would be appreciated! I know that a lot of this might be proprietary info that we may never know.

I just learned that laserdiscs are an analog storage medium.  I always assumed they were digital, like CD and DVDs; do to their similar macro appearance.  So I googled ""laserdisc under microscope"" and what I saw, I don't understand.  There are distinct [pits](https://www.modeemi.fi/~leopold/AV/Img/Laserdisc.gif), but very [different from CDs](https://www.modeemi.fi/~leopold/AV/Img/CompactDisc.gif), where the 1s and 0s are obvious.

On a vinyl record, you can see the obvious grooves representing the stereo signal; it is smooth like you'd expect for analog.


What is being modulated in the laserdisc pits, and is it true analog or are the pits just ""high enough resolution"" to approximate analog signals with each step?

I hope that makes some sense.  Thanks.  Sorry if flair should be computing or engineering.

**EDIT: Thanks u/Diligent_Nature for the answer.

It's named after Dr. Michael Freilich, the former director of NASA's Earth Science Division and a tireless advocate for advancing satellite measurements of the ocean. Liftoff is Saturday, Nov. 21 at 12:17 p.m. EST (9:17 a.m. PST, 5:17 p.m. UTC) on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

This spacecraft will:

+ Provide information that will help researchers understand how climate change is reshaping Earth's coastlines - and how fast this is happening.
+ See things that previous sea level missions couldn't, including smaller, more complicated ocean features, especially near the coastlines.
+ Further build upon a highly successful U.S.-European partnership - it's the first NASA-ESA joint effort in an Earth science satellite mission, first international involvement in the European Union's Copernicus program, and continues a tradition of cooperation between NASA, NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and European partners including ESA (European Space Agency), EUMETSAT (European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) and CNES (Centre national d'études spatiales).
+ Expand the global atmospheric temperature data record, the mission will help researchers better understand how Earth's climate is changing.
+ Help to improve weather forecasts by providing meteorologists information on atmospheric temperature and humidity.

Read more about the mission in the [official press kit](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press_kits/sentinel-6/).

Participants are:

+ Sandra Cauffman, Deputy Director, Earth Sciences Division, NASA Science Mission Directorate
+ Craig Donlon, ESA Mission Scientist for the Copernicus Sentinel-6 mission
+ Hayley Evers-King, Marine Application Expert, EUMETSAT
+ Ben Hamlington, Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich Research Scientist, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
+ Eric Leuilette, Program Scientist for Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, NOAA
+ Mic Woltman, Chief, Fleet Systems Integration, NASA's Launch Services Program
+ Lieutenant Colonel Bryan Titus, Deputy Commander of the 30th Operations Group, U.S. Space Force

With the exciting news about the mRNA vaccine efficacy I wanted to better understand how the vaccine type works - especially since it hasn't been used in humans before. Specifically I wanted to know if there is a reasonable chance for long term harm that wouldn't be caught in the initial studies during the pandemic.

My understanding is the mRNA makes its way into your cells and the cells manufacture a protein unique to the virus (in this case the spike protein). This protein is then presented on the surface of your cells and then an immune cell comes along and checks it. The immune cell will recognize the protein as foreign, assume (incorrectly?) that the host cell is infected / cancerous and tell it to kill itself.

So, my question is, assuming the above is a mostly accurate representation of how the vaccine works, should we be concerned that we are training the immune system to kill otherwise healthy cells?",True,False,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,19997140,public,self,Could mRNA vaccines cause auto-immune disorders?,0,[],0.56,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/jv9l57/could_mrna_vaccines_cause_autoimmune_disorders/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am proud to also work for Unistellar, a private company whose goal is to create the largest network of citizen astronomers around the world, capable of reconnecting with the dark sky with a digital, smart telescope and collecting scientific data for space agencies.

I am pleased to announce new scientific results with the Unistellar network, where citizen astronomers helped derive the shape and size of an asteroid (https://seti.org/press-release/amateurs-reshape-asteroids-their-backyard). I recently did a SETI Live with citizen astronomers Rachel Knight and Brad Davis to talk about this project (https://youtu.be/lX0ff1jeF9s).

You can also confirm TESS exoplanet candidates and help astronomers to observe the sky 24/7. From your backyard, your balcony, your roof, or far away from cities you can join a network of 3,000 citizen astronomers and help us to explore the cosmos. The SETI Institute is the science partner of Unistellar.

You can connect with me at @AllPlanets (https://twitter.com/AllPlanets) on Twitter, or on my page https://www.facebook.com/RealAllPlanets at Facebook.

have seen many mentions, that being overweight is one of the risk factors to have more sever case of COVID-19. I wonder, why exactly does this happen. Is it related to the fact that overweight people are often less active (don't exercise much, have sedentary lifestyle, etc - so, for example, their respiratory system is more susceptible to the impact of the virus) or does it have something to do with being overweight in general (hormones, metabolism or something else) ? 

&amp;#x200B;

Why do I ask: I'm overweight, I started to exercise regularly since spring and dropped about 9 kg/19 pounds so far. Such tasks like going upstairs or running are much easier now, but my weight is still above the norm for my age/height. So I wonder if I've lowered the risk of getting the severe form of covid-19. (It's just curiousity, I'll continue to follow social distancing and other rules in any case.)

Edit: Thanks for all the answers, I totally didn't expect the post to blow up. Now I have much to read, thanks to all people willing to explain. (And to some kind strangers for the awards). 

And huge respect to AskScience moderators for clearing all these ""because fat is bad"" useless and/or insulting answers, that I see in mobile notifications. 

And yes, I understand that being overweight or obese is unhealthy in general, no need to remind me about this. My question was about that particular case with covid-19.

NASA's Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) program pioneers scientific discovery in and beyond low-Earth orbit to drive advances in science, technology and space exploration. These space experiments expand the frontiers of knowledge, capability and opportunity in space.

This year, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) will begin the process of formulating a community consensus about the most compelling science questions for the decade ahead in each of the BPS disciplines. Known as the Decadal Surveys, the process provides a rare opportunity for scientists and engineers to share their insights and help shape the scientific endeavors of the next decade.

The purpose of this AMA is to answer questions about the work being done by NASA's Biological and Physical Sciences division and to address how researchers can get engaged in the Decadal process, types of past research efforts stemming from the previous survey, the types of research that the BPS division supports, etc.

For about the past two years I have had periodic attacks of chills, fever, and night sweats every few months that have come on quickly but mostly disappeared in about 2-3 days. These are apparently consistent with malaria but could be many other things. I’ve been to doctors and had standard blood tests that have come up normal and so far my doctors have not been able to determine a cause. I used to work in malarial areas of Namibia and the last time I was there was in 2015 but I did not develop symptoms until 2018. 

My questions are: Can malaria lay dormant for 3 years before a person develops symptoms? If so, how does that work?

I’m curious because I’ve read about it and I’d like a confirmation if this is actually true and an explanation of how it works.

Due to the growing demand and need for COVID-19 testing, production of supplies required to test for other infectious diseases has dwindled. This has led to a ripple effect of shortages and is causing a major delay in testing for common infections, such as urinary tract infections, sexually-transmitted infections including chlamydia and gonorrhea, gastroenteritis and cystic fibrosis.

Join us today at 2 PM ET for a discussion organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) on approaches being taken to catalogue, track and address these supply shortages. In particular, we'll discuss a new platform developed by the Association for Supply Chain Management and the ASM to monitor real-time levels of, and demand for, COVID-19 testing supplies down to the level of individual laboratories. We'll also answer your questions about future decisions about supply chain management of laboratory reagents and testing protocols. Ask us anything!

Poop, sludgy grease, and leftover food seem best destined for the nearest landfill or wastewater resource recovery facility.

But when paired with waste-to-energy technology, these things can become downright energetic---in the form of biofuels. Organic wastes serve as potential biofuel feedstocks, and they are available just about anywhere across the nation.

Bioenergy experts at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have developed a process called Hydrothermal Liquefaction, or HTL, which can literally turn breakfast (leftovers) into biocrude.

HTL mimics the geological conditions the Earth uses to create crude oil, using high pressure and temperature to achieve in minutes what has typically taken millions of years. The resulting material is similar to petroleum pumped out of the ground, but also contains small amounts of water, oxygen, and sometimes nitrogen.

HTL has advantages over other thermochemical conversion methods. It works best with wet biomass - like [poop](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/how-wastewater-treatment-plants-could-be-pumping-out-fuel-instead-sludge), algae, and food and [agriculture wastes](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/boosting-biocrude-gaining-twice-fuel-corn-waste) - heck, even [beer waste](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/pnnl-researchers-make-beer-run-name-science)! It has the ability to transform almost all of the biomass into biocrude oil. It also offers opportunities to recover nutrients such as phosphorous, an element in fertilizer that is needed to grow food.

Our research using HTL is typically supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's [Bioenergy Technologies Office](https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy), who works with government, industrial, academic, agricultural, and nonprofit partners across the nation to develop commercially viable, high-performance biofuels, bioproducts, and biopower made from renewable biomass resources that reduce our dependence on oil while enhancing energy security.

We are down with that! Come ask us questions about our research and [analyses](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/breakfast-biocrude-study-identifies-production-potential-across-nation) using HTL, we are excited to have the conversation with you. We will be back at noon PDT to answer your questions.

During my time in space, I took more than 300,000 photos of earth, conducted hundreds of experiments, did everything from shooting an IMAX movie to replacing a crew mate's tooth filling! I also went on three spacewalks. I'm now a professional speaker, photographer, director, and author. My directorial debut documentary, *One More Orbit*, was released on VOD on Oct. 6 and my new book, *How to Astronaut: An Insider's Guide to Leaving Planet Earth* released on Sep. 15! From fighter jets to unwieldly space suits, space station cuisine, and an uncensored look at answering the call of nature in zero-g, ***HOW TO ASTRONAUT: An Insider's Guide To Leaving Planet Earth*** is a wildly entertaining collection of short essays that offers a primer for future space tourists with a sneak peek behind the curtain at the rules, lessons, procedures, and experiences of space travel.

The following scientists are part of the OSIRIS-REx mission - NASA's first mission to collect a sample of an asteroid and return it to Earth. They have just published a collection of papers that confirm that asteroid Bennu - the target of OSIRIS-REx - is an ideal candidate to reveal clues about the origins of life in our solar system. These discoveries complete the OSIRIS-REx mission's pre-sample collection science requirements and offer insight into the sample of Bennu that scientists will study for generations to come.

 The discoveries tell us that Bennu:

+ Contains carbon-bearing, organic materials
+ Likely used to interact with water
+ Has a type of porous rock that would offer a new, unique perspective to our meteorite collections on Earth
+ Is made up of an interior not uniform in density
+ Contains ridge-like mounds that stretch from pole to pole and has differently shaped hemispheres
+ Has areas, including our sample site, that have not been exposed to a lot of space weathering

We;re Jamie Holladay, David Hume, and Lindsay Steele from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Jennifer States from Washington Maritime Blue and DNV GL. Did you know the use of hydrogen to power equipment and ships at our nation's ports can greatly reduce energy consumption and harmful emissions? Did you know that the transportation sector contributes 29 percent of harmful emissions to the atmosphere-more than the electricity, industrial, commercial and residential, and agricultural sectors?

The nation's ports consume more than 4 percent of the 28 percent of energy consumption attributed to the transportation sector. More than 2 million marine vessels worldwide transport greater than 90 percent of the world's goods. On land, countless pieces of equipment, such as cranes and yard tractors, support port operations.

Those vessels and equipment consume 300 million tonnes of diesel fuel per year, produce 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emission, and generate the largest source of sulfur dioxide emissions.

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and collaborators are looking at how we can help the nation's ports reduce energy consumption and harmful emissions by using hydrogen as a zero-emission fuel.

We've conducted a study with several U.S. ports to assess replacing diesel with hydrogen fuel cells in port operations.  We've done this through collection of information about equipment inventory; annual and daily use, power, and fuel consumption; data from port administrators and tenants; and satellite imagery to verify port equipment profiles. We crunched the data and found that hydrogen demand for the U.S. maritime industry could exceed a half million tonnes per year.

We are also seeking to apply our abundant hydrogen expertise to provide a multi-use renewable hydrogen system to the Port of Seattle-which will provide the city's utility provider with an alternative clean resource.

Our research is typically supported by the Department of Energy's Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office.

We'd love to talk with you about our experiences and plans to connect our nation's ports to a hydrogen future. We will be back at noon PDT (3 ET, 19 UT) to answer your questions. AUA!

I interview people around the United States to understand their experiences engaging with images and videos on health and science topics like COVID-19. Previously, I led UX research and design for the New York Times R&amp;D Lab's [News Provenance Project](http://newsprovenanceproject.com/).

And I'm [Victoria](http://www.twitter.com/victoriakwan_), the ethics and standards editor at [First Draft](https://firstdraftnews.org/), an organization that develops tools and strategies for protecting communities against harmful misinformation. My work explores ways in which journalists and other information providers can effectively slow the spread of misinformation (which, as of late, includes a great deal of coronavirus- and vaccine-related misinfo). Previously, I worked at Thomson Reuters.

Keeping our information environment free from pollution - particularly on a topic as important as health - is a massive task. It requires effort from all segments of society, including platforms, media outlets, civil society organizations and the general public. To that end, we recently collaborated on [a list of design principles](https://medium.com/swlh/it-matters-how-platforms-label-manipulated-media-here-are-12-principles-designers-should-follow-438b76546078) platforms should follow when labeling misinformation in media, such as manipulated images and video. We're here to answer your questions on misinformation: manipulation tactics, risks of misinformation, media and platform moderation, and how science professionals can counter misinformation.

She didn't understand at all, and I only vaguely do (imagine what that argument was like). But at the end of the debate, I was left with a new question.

If I fill a cup with water in a tub, turn it upside down, and raise it out of the water, keeping the rim submerged, the water doesn't fall out of the cup. My understanding is, the water is being pulled down by gravity, but can't fall because there's nothing to take its place, and it takes a lot of energy to create a vacuum, so the water is simply being held up by the cup, and is exerting some kind of negative pressure on the inside of the cup. When I make a hole in the cup, air can be pulled in to take its place in the cup, so the water can fall.

If I did this experiment in a vacuum, I figure something very similar would happen. The water would be held in the cup until I made a hole, then it would fall into the tub. If anything, the water will fall a little faster, since it doesn't need to do any work to pull air into the cup through the hole. But then it seems that the vacuum is coming in to fill the space, which sounds wrong since the vacuum isn't a thing that moves.

I'm missing something in all of this. Vacuum isn't like air, it doesn't rush in through the hole in the cup to take the place of the water, allowing the water to fall. But then why does making a hole in the cup allow the water to fall?",True,False,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,19779956,public,self,Is vacuum something that is conserved or that moves from place to place?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/j1ffed/is_vacuum_something_that_is_conserved_or_that/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use tools from psychology, neuroscience, genetics, medicine, and engineering to better understand how and **why humans engage with music** and to what degree musicality interacts with language and social communication. Many of you readers probably have intuitions about [how people with a more ""musical ear"" might have a leg up while learning a new language](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00327/full), or about how musical talent runs in families, or that children's music skills may be affected by the musical environment to which they are exposed.

But did you know that what scientists are learning about music, genetics, and the brain may even be important for our understanding of childhood speech-language development? In 2015 [we showed that children's rhythm skills are predictive of their spoken language skills](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/11/141105101238.htm).  Many studies have also found that people with reading disability and speech problems are more likely to have difficulty with music rhythm. Our [recent paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcs.1528) reviewed evidence for a new framework about rhythm and speech-language development. Discoveries in this emerging area could help solve an urgent public health problem, which is that many children with language problems are not getting identified or treated!

Alongside this AMA, there is an opportunity to participate in research.

*Do you have good rhythm? Or is rhythm hard for you? All skill levels are welcome! Our new study examines the biological basis of musical rhythm, with an online rhythm test and optional mail-in saliva collection.

Let's talk about the scientific study of music and language in the brain - Ask Me (us) Anything!


Bios

+ **Reyna Gordon, PhD** (/u/Reyna_Gordon): I am an Assistant Professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where I direct the Music Cognition Lab (/u/VandyMusicCog) and also am on the faculty of the Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, the Vanderbilt Brain Institute, and the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center. My research group's interdisciplinary research program is focused on the relationship between rhythm and language abilities from behavioral, cognitive, neural, and genetic perspectives. I am passionate about [training students and staff to work across traditional disciplinary boundaries](https://www.vumc.org/music-cognition-lab/publication/interprofessional-education-next-generation-musician-scientists-through-music-cognition). I hold a PhD in Complex Systems and Brain Sciences, and before I became a cognitive neuroscientist, I was a classically trained singer (my Bachelor's degree is in Vocal Arts!).
+ **Eniko Ladanyi, PhD**. I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Music Cognition Lab of Vanderbilt University Medical Center. I have degrees in linguistics and cognitive science and my current research focuses on associations between rhythm and language skills in typical and atypical speech/language development. I use EEG and behavioral tests to investigate whether rhythm skills at infancy can predict childhood speech/language development and whether children with low speech/language skills also show low rhythm skills. I hope my research will eventually improve screening and therapy of children with speech or language disorders.
+ **Daniel Gustavson, PhD**. I am a Research Instructor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Trained in cognitive psychology and behavior genetics, I use twin studies and measured genetic data to understand how cognitive abilities relate to everyday behaviors such as procrastination, impulsivity, goal management, and (most recently) music engagement. I'm also interested in how our cognitive abilities (like memory and self-control) change over the course of the lifespan, and what types of factors help us improve the most through childhood and keep us most resilient to decline in old age. I play a range of instruments including guitar, drums, and harmonica.
+ **Olivia Boorom MS, CCC-SLP**. (/u/OliviaBoorom) I am a certified speech-language pathologist at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Music Cognition Lab. I use behavioral measures to investigate how language and social communication skills relate to rhythmicity, and how the natural rhythms of our daily interactions impact language development in children with Autism spectrum disorder and Developmental Language Disorder. I'm also interested in how music can be used as a tool to support parents and clinicians during everyday activities and during intervention. Before becoming a clinician I was an avid flute player!
+ **Srishti Nayak, PhD.** I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at the Music Cognition Lab studying the biological bases of speech rhythms (prosody) and its relationships to musical rhythm and language development. My training is in Developmental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience methods, and my work investigates how language environments early in life shape cognitive and neural development. Relatedly, I am interested in how different ""domains"" of cognition - e.g. our attention system or our emotional brain - interact with language. Given my longstanding interest in language as both an environmental *input*, and an *outcome*, my current work investigates bidirectional links between music and language skills, and the possible neural and genetic basis underlying individual variation in these skills.
+ **Anna Kasdan, BS**. I am a third year PhD candidate in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at Vanderbilt University. Broadly, I study the neural basis of rhythm in both neurotypical individuals and in individuals with Williams syndrome and aphasia, using neuroimaging techniques such as EEG as well as behavioral measures.

Also answering questions today is [Cassandra Garrison](https://twitter.com/CassLGarrison), a reporter at [Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) who [wrote about one of my latest studies](https://www.reuters.com/article/climate-change-arctic-idAFL1N2FG1I3). The new study suggests the territory's ice sheet will now gain mass only once every 100 years -- a grim indicator of how difficult it is to re-grow glaciers once they hemorrhage ice. In studying satellite images of the glaciers, our team noted that the glaciers had a 50% chance of regaining mass before 2000, with the odds declining since.

On Earth, this gas is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments. Astronomers have speculated for decades that high clouds on Venus could offer a home for microbes - floating free of the scorching surface but needing to tolerate very high acidity. The detection of phosphine could point to such extra-terrestrial ""aerial"" life as astronomers have ruled out all other known natural mechanisms for its origin.

Signs of phosphine were first spotted in observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), operated by the East Asian Observatory, in Hawai'i. Astronomers then confirmed the discovery using the more-sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. Both facilities observed Venus at a wavelength of about 1 millimetre, much longer than the human eye can see - only telescopes at high altitude can detect it effectively.

Details on the discovery can be read here: https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2015/

We are a group of researchers who have been involved in this result and experts from the facilities used for this discovery. We will be available on Wednesday, 16 September, starting with 16:00 UTC, 18:00 CEST (Central European Summer Time), 12:00 EDT (Eastern Daylight Time). Ask Us Anything!

For both lossless and lossy compression algorithms, is the size of the compressed data directly proportional to the size of the input data? For example, let’s say I’m using algorithm A on data d1, and the compressed output is size s1. If I run algorithm A on d2, and size(d2)==2*size(d1), will s2 == 2(s1)?

I understand there are many different compression algorithms so this may be hard to answer truly in the general case, just want to get a basic understanding.",True,False,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,19705098,public,self,Are the number of bytes output from a compression algorithm directly proportionate to the number of input bytes?,0,[],0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/is6d5e/are_the_number_of_bytes_output_from_a_compression/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, while it may not functionally affect the majority of the population in terms of grip strength, it appears that in high level sports requiring strong grip, top athletes are more likely to have a palmaris longus than lower performing athletes.

Another interesting aspect is that the PL may affect the tendency for people to use one hand for writing over the other if the preferred writing hand has a PL.

Using myself as an example, I have a PL on my left wrist and no PL on my right wrist, and it is preferred for writing. Interestingly enough, I prefer to throw with my right, use a knife with my right, strum guitar with my right. In fact about the only things i use my left hand for that is different to a right handed person is writing and using a spoon.

I also notice that when pinching my thumb and pinkie finger together on my left hand, that it is far stronger and can exert pressure and can be positioned directly on my thumb. Whereas my right thumb-pinkie pinch can barely exert any force and cant actually bend far enough to properly meet the thumb, although it certainly can be manually bent further (so flexibility is not the issue)

Given these factors, is it actually correct to call the PL vestigial, when in reality it seems to increase pinch pressure, range of motion, force exertion and dexterity for the pinkie finger?",True,False,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,19700147,public,self,"Is the Palmaris Longus, vestigial or functional?",0,[],0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/irm8mq/is_the_palmaris_longus_vestigial_or_functional/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm S. ""Bala"" Balachandar, a professor in the mechanical and aerospace engineering department at the University of Florida College of Engineering. Right now, I'm leading a study of aerosols and multiphase flow to determine how far droplets can travel and infect others. During the COVID-19 global pandemic, many safety guidelines currently set in place have been determined by outdated science that says we will be safe if we are six feet apart from a sick person.

I'm here to answer any questions you may have on the science behind virus travel, airborne transmission/host-to-host transmission, how inhalation and exhalation transmit a virus and the way particle sizes affect transmission.

At the University of Florida, my teaching interests are:

+ Computational fluid science
+ Large scale simulation of complex flows
+ Transition and turbulence
+ Multiphase flows
+ Environmental flows

More about me:

I joined the Wertheim College of Engineering at UF after teaching in the Department of Theoretical &amp; Applied Mechanics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign from 1990 to 2005 and after I earned my Ph.D from Brown University in 1988. I am a fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Society of Engineers as well as co-editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Multiphase Flow and associate editor of the Theoretical and Computational Fluid Dynamics Journal. I am also the Principal Investigator at the Center for Compressible Multiphase Turbulence.

Ask us anything, from our daily research to the organization of a large conference during COVID19! We have some special experts on

+ Inflation: The mind-bogglingly fast expansion of the Universe in a fraction of the first second. It turned tiny quantum fluctuation into the seeds for the galaxies and clusters we see today
+ The Cosmic Microwave background: The radiation reaching us from a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang. It shows us how our universe was like, 13.4 billion years ago
+ Large Scale Structure: Matter in the Universe forms a ""cosmic web"" with clusters, filaments and voids. The positions of galaxies in the sky shows imprints of the physics in the early universe
+ Dark Matter: Most matter in the universe seems to be ""Dark Matter"", i.e. not noticeable through any means except for its effect on light and other matter via gravity
+ Gravitational Lensing: Matter in the universe bends the path of light. This allows us to ""see"" the (invisible) dark matter in the Universe and how it is distributed
+ *And ask anything else you want to know!*

Answering your questions tonight are

These are intriguing places to study, because Earth has taught us to ""follow the water"" when searching for life in the galaxy. On our planet, water is crucial to life. 

We're learning that ocean worlds could be ubiquitous in the galaxy. Just in our solar system, we have found evidence of oceans on Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus; Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto; Neptune's moon Triton; and on Pluto. We also believe that Venus and Mars may have had oceans billions of years ago. Could they have supported life? Ask us about ocean worlds, what mysteries we're working to solve, and which ones we're going to next.

We are:

+ **Carrie Andersen** - planetary astronomer - research focus on the ocean worlds, Titan and Enceladus.
+ **Giada Arney** - planetary scientist and astrobiologist who studies habitable exoplanets and whether Venus could have been an ocean world.
+ **Lucas Paganini** - planetary scientist at NASA Headquarters who specializes in icy moons, comets, and planetary atmospheres.
+ **Avi Mandell** - exoplanetary scientist and astrobiologist who observes and models exoplanets around nearby stars.
+ **Melissa Trainer** - planetary scientist who is deputy principal investigator of the Dragonfly mission to Titan. Studies organic synthesis and processing on Titan.
+ **Kira Olsen** - geophysicist who studies icequakes and the icy shells of ocean worlds.
+ **Joe Renaud** - planetary scientist who studies tidal dynamics and tidal heating in solar system moons and in exoplanets.

I'm curious how programmed or predictable mosquito behaviors are. For example, does it actually have a behavior like ""if swatted at, lay low for 30 minutes before trying again?"" Or am I just imagining the correlation? Second, if they do have a ""hide"" behavior, do they choose predictable locations? Do they prefer corners of the room? Areas with less light (do they even use light in making their decisions)? Do they go low to the ground? High on the ceiling? Do they use air currents and calmness to choose a spot? 

It seems like I usually find mosquitos hiding out in a shadowy corner near the floor of the room, which is infuriating because if it would just hang out in the open against the white, well-lit wall, it would be a lot easier to hunt them down.

But does it matter how much virus you were infected with to start? Like, if person A walks through 10 virus-laden sneeze clouds and inhales a few million virions, and person B has the bad luck to have a single virion land in a sweet spot in their nasal membrane, and if both people are infected from this, is person A probably going to get a lot sicker than person B?

What I'm wondering, I guess, is whether viral *load* is infectious?

I figure the answer is yes (I want to know if it's no, though). If so, following from that, does that mean that person A will be spreading a lot more virus (sneezing clouds that contain more virions)?

If *that's* a yes, does that mean you can have different intensities of viral infection spreading in a population? Like, you can have chains of low-level infections or of high-level infections?

Sorry if this is a common question, I tried to find it but could not find anything exactly to the point I'm looking for.

Nearly 11 million names from around the world will fly to Mars, [etched on three small microchips](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8634/109-million-names-now-aboard-nasas-perseverance-mars-rover/) Perseverance carries - but even if your name's not one of them, [there's plenty you can do to take part in the mission virtually](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/virtual-guest-perseverance/index.html).

We'll be answering questions from 4:30 - 6:30 PM ET (1:30 - 3:30 PM ET). Thanks for joining us!

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/etk5jj/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxii/).

The panel is an informal group of redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

---

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,

* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.


------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).

* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)

* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)

* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?

* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

-----------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

       Username: /u/foretopsail
       General field: Anthropology
       Specific field: Maritime Archaeology
       Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction. 
       Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.
       Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

I have been an astrobiologist at the SETI Institute's Carl Sagan Center since 2009.  My office and lab are based at the nearby NASA Ames Research Center, which I joined for my NASA postdoctoral research that was focused on the habitability of subsurface biospheres during a robotic drilling mission simulation in the Rio Tinto's underground (Spain).

I enjoy doing science to advance our understanding of the universe we can see and to inspire old and new generations of my fellow humans - from any latitude, longitude, and altitude - to pursue happiness through scientific knowledge, exploration, and discovery.

For the past 15 years, I have expanded my interest to the habitability of mineralogical Mars analogs, in particular as a science team member and field instructor joining NASA's Spaceward Bound expeditions to remote places including the Mojave Desert, Antarctica, Atacama (Chile), Australia, New Zealand, Israel, the Namib Desert, and the Tibetan Plateau (see links below). My ultimate goal is to achieve a broad picture of where life and its signatures are most successfully distributed, concentrated, preserved, and detected. This knowledge helps us to understand how to search for life beyond Earth. To achieve this goal I am involved in a broad array of research, laboratory, experimentation, and field exploration activities.

For instance, I have been studying the distribution of life indicators in Death Valley National Park (California) in support of the Curiosity rover mission and other planned searches for life on Mars. Last but not least, over the past three years, I have been implementing innovative laboratory experiments to simulate the plumes of the Saturnian moon Enceladus and similar environments to support future flyby missions to detect life on distant Ocean Worlds.

More specifically, I have been working at the Ubehebe Volcanic Field (UVC), in Death Valley National Park, where I am applying results from this research to support missions to Mars such as the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission objectives in collaboration with MSL scientists. In Death Valley, I have been conducting long-term monitoring of the weather/climate and surface water cycle, formation, and stability of short-lived water bodies, source-to-sink of sedimentary clay minerals (clays) to support the astrobiology of clays and life detection protocols.

Another project relates to Planetary Protection (PP) involving contamination control plans to clean, disinfect and sterilize spacecraft-like hardware and certifying cleanliness levels using non culture-based biological assays e.g., LAL (Lymulus Amebocite Lysate) and ATP (adenosine triphosphate) Luminometry. The ultimate objective is to prevent biological contamination of terrestrial origin on other planets. I was Co-I of a NASA funded PP project (2008-2011).

I am also passionate about sharing what I do with students, teachers, and the general public. So, I have gotten busy with a variety of education and public outreach projects. In close collaboration with the National Park Service, I volunteered to support Park Ranger programs for several years, culminating with MarsFest Planetary Science events in Death Valley.  I have also led field trips for the Road Scholar Lifelong Learning program for the Death Valley Natural History Association in 2014, engaging senior citizens to explore planetary analogues. As a former elementary school teacher (1988-89), I believe that outdoor, hands-on science education is the best way to go to learn the beauty of the scientific method and that everyone can do it. In addition to being a scientist, I have been engaged and led Education and Public Outreach events with non-profit and corporate organizations since 1989.

Last but not least, I have been involved as an instructor during the one-week Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) summer camp since 2011 and led the Field Program as Director for the past six years.  The REU program is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to the SETI Institute and managed by M. Tiscareno (PI). The objective of the field trip is to engage the REU interns to explore the biological and geological features of extreme and planetary analog environments in the framework of the astrobiology research done at the SETI Institute.

This year, due to COVID-19, I am converting the hands-on field trip into a virtual format. During the AMA day I will be at the SETI ATA facility - in Hat Creek - to visit the nearby Lassen National Park and obtain visual material to share and discuss online with this year's REU Students!

I don't understand the reasoning there . I do understand the whole relationship about hotter air being able to hold more water, but in my understanding, our bodies sense humidity by sensing the rate of evaporation of our sweat. If the produced sweat cannot evaporate, the air feels hotter and ""stickier"". The evaporation rate of sweat however is mostly dependent on the saturation of the surrounding air with water vapor, and the saturation is measured by relative humidity, not absolute humidity.

To illustrate my point: For a fixed water vapor content of (10g water/1qm air), the higher the temperature, the lower saturation level (relative humidity), and the higher the rate of evaporation. Plus, the higher temperatures are going to give more kinetic energy to the water molecules in my sweat, further increasing the rate of evaporation.

So it makes no sense to me to say that a dew point of 16 degrees Celsius is usually what people regard as ""sticky"", because it cannot tell me anything about the expected rate of evaporation of my sweat. Thus, I came to the conclusion that my understanding that we perceive humidity by the rate of evaporation must be flawed, and this yields my question.",True,False,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,19415308,public,self,How does the human body sense humidity?,0,[],0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hwdgce/how_does_the_human_body_sense_humidity/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mind you, neither of us are doctors or have studied psychology professionally. But he basically says that psychiatry and psychology are soft sciences and that there's no actual proof that NPD is a real disease that affects the brain. Further, he says that it doesn't matter that NPD is listed in the DSM or that the general psychiatric community agrees that it is an illness because ultimately these conclusions are ""opinions rather than facts."" He referenced how we have hard evidence that the Earth is round or that Alzheimer's causes brain cells to waste away and I honestly didn't know what to say. I referenced studies that have found structural abnormalities in the brains of people suffering from NPD but he says that those studies show a correlation rather than actual evidence of a disease.

The Observatory is within the United States National Radio Quiet Zone, a 13,000 square mile area of the Appalachian mountains where radio transmissions are limited by federal and state law. These protections become more restrictive as you move closer to Green Bank, so since I live on observatory grounds, I go about my daily life with no cell phone, no microwave, no wifi, no wireless headphones...

The Green Bank Telescope (GBT) is the largest movable structure anywhere on land, sitting at 485 feet tall and 17 million pounds. The radio telescope has a diameter of 100 meters (~300 feet) -- you could easily fit two football fields on the telescope's surface. The GBT is used to observe a huge variety of astrophysical phenomena, from active star forming regions, to pulsars and fast radio bursts, to galaxies billions of light years away, and more.

My position involves a mix of my own scientific research and the chance to work with astronomers from across the world who want to use the GBT. I also coordinate our student research programs and observer training workshops. My scientific research focuses on how the Milky Way Galaxy conspires to produce high-mass star (masses greater than ~10 times that of our Sun). We use these high-mass star forming regions as probes for studying the structure of the Milky Way and how the environment around the Sun compares with other regions of our Galaxy. I'm particularly interested in an extremely distant spiral arm, known as the Outer Scutum-Centaurus Arms, which seems to be the outermost limit for high-mass star formation in our Galaxy about 20 kpc (or 70,000 light years) from the Earth.

I'm originally from Ford City, Pennsylvania and went to Ford City High School. I graduated from Westminster College in 2012 with a BS in Physics and finished my PhD in Physics at West Virginia University in 2018. I started a postdoctoral position at the Green Bank Observatory right after graduate school, and was hired onto the permanent scientific staff earlier this year. Outside of work, I keep busy hiking in the Appalachians, keeping track of a small flock chickens, and renovating a huge century old building in my hometown with my siblings (any leads on old planetarium equipment?).

I'll be on at 1 pm EDT (17 UT) on Wednesday, July 22nd, ask me anything!

In terms of who uses it, what kind of industries employ the use of a supercomputer or facilities that it may provide? I understand it is great for building simulations and testing them out, but I want to understand what sort of entities would use such services for these simulations, and how would they employ its resources? Ofcourse, R&amp;D for companies, research for educational institutions etc are some uses I know of generally - but I was just hoping someone who knows more about them can also elucidate on the finer aspects of exactly what they are used for.

We are excited to discuss how statistical education is crucial for minimizing the public's susceptibility to disinformation. That includes journalists, who play a pivotal role in improving data literacy.

I'm Karen, and I'm a statistics professor, Chair of the University of Virginia's Department of Statistics, and 2019 President of the ASA. Ask me anything about how the statistical community and the media can help the public understand and be less influenced by fake news.

Last year, I helped champion ASA's ""[Disinformation Initiative](https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2019/11/01/making-a-statistical-impact-with-text-data/)"" for statisticians and computer scientists to collaborate and address the challenges associated with this deception. I've served on several National Academy of Sciences' Committees, including those that led to the reports [Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf) (2009), [Review of the Scientific Approaches Used During the FBI's Investigation of the Anthrax Letters](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK209412/) (2011), and [Identifying the Culprit: Assessing Eyewitness Identification](https://www.nap.edu/read/18891/chapter/1#vii) (2014).

I'm Dick, and I'm a statistics professor at Williams College and the current Vice President of ASA. Ask me anything about how to communicate important statistical ideas in ways that everyone can use, especially during this time of disinformation and confusion.

I've written six high school and college statistics textbooks that have been read by literally millions of students. They've even appeared on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=stats%3A%20data%20and%20models) a few times. I give keynote addresses and workshops around the world and have appeared on radio ([WAMC](https://www.wamc.org/post/alan-chartock-interviews-williams-college-professor-dr-richard-de-veaux) and [Marketplace](https://www.marketplace.org/2019/07/30/the-reality-of-a-massive-security-breach/)) and TV [(NOVA and PBS)](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/prediction-by-the-numbers/). In my spare time I sing with the Choeur Regional de l'Ile de France in Paris (when I'm there) and have appeared with them on both CDs and French radio and TV. I'm also known as the ""Official Statistician for the Grateful Dead."" Yes, you can ask about that. 

I'm Regina, and I'm ASA's Senior Advisor for Statistics Communication and Media Innovation. Ask me anything about [non-traditional ways](https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2018/when-courtroom-science-goes-wrong-and-how-stats-can-fix-it) to showcase statistics and how to communicate statistics to the public in an age of disinformation.

I'm also a professor at Gallaudet University and an adjunct professor at Virginia Tech. My work has been published in The New York Times, Scientific American and ESPN Magazine, among other outlets. My feature article on [p-values for Nature](https://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700), which won ASA's 2014 Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award, remains in the [top 5% of all research outputs](https://www.altmetric.com/details/2115792) scored by Altmetric. I was also featured in PBS's [""NOVA: Prediction by the Numbers,""](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/prediction-by-the-numbers/) I'm particularly interested in how easy it is for us to [fool ourselves and others with statistics](https://www.nature.com/news/how-scientists-fool-themselves-and-how-they-can-stop-1.18517) during data analysis and the scientific process, and how we should be communicating quantitative information in a way that our brains can ""get it"" more easily. 

We will be on at noon ET (16 UT), ask us anything!

I am not an expert but with many friends and family in the field of medicine and/or biology it was my perspective that such a revelation means that the virus is much more infectious then we at first believed.

Where the problem comes in is that I would think then that even the super-strict lockdowns like in New Zealand should therefore of not been enough to reduce the cases to such an extent which then makes me doubt that the virus is indeed able to hang around for that long.

This point is further hammered upon by the other theories of it being mostly asymptomatic and capable of reinfection.
