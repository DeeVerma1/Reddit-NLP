Technically by limiting ourselves to only logic based units of dimensional measure we limit ourselves to only viewing observation with the dimension of time included.   


Superpositioning for example seems illogical as we monitor it in time via snapshots. However when you remove time from the equation you simply see a point of matter with a range of energy levels. No ""action"" is occuring because during superpositioning the forces are impacting dimensions outside of time but we filter the observation through time thus it seems illogical. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think much of this comes down to the current model of spacetime being 3 dimensions of space and 1 dimension of time and assumes that frame of reference is the only reference point required to understand physics.

&amp;#x200B;

 I want to challenge that theory as I believe the more appropriate representation would require 2 or more separate frames of reference if the same identical observation in time are required to properly define quantum physics as we need too look at the manifestation of the phenomenon through the lens of multiple reference points and combine them to define the dimensions of the observable. 

  
As well I think the current view of how dimensions are created is being viewed incorrectly as some observables must be observed outside the dimension of time thus we need a frame of reference other than spacetime. See my tweet below where I go through a physical example of what I think a dimensional model should appear using an empty vape cartidge and explain how you can create 3 dimensions by wrapping one dimension around another than pushing it into a third dimension.

I am a forensic anthropologist, a research assistant scientist and interim director of the C. A. Pound Human Identification Lab at the University of Florida. During the centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre, I will continue to excavate with the Physical Investigation Team at the Oaklawn Cemetery in Tulsa, Oklahoma to identify victims from the violence in 1921.

I'm here to answer your questions about the intersection of cultural anthropology with forensic sciences and our work in uncovering some of the history behind the Tulsa Race Massacre, a devastating attack on what was once known as Tulsa's thriving Black Community.

[Proof!](https://twitter.com/UFExplore/status/1392870695516790786?s=20)

My research interests at the University of Florida are:

+ Human skeletal variation
+ Human identification
+ Paleopathology
+ Forensic anthropology

More about me: In 2002, I received my Ph.D. in Anthropology from the University of Florida where I was the last graduate student of Dr. William R. Maples, founder of the C.A. Pound Human ID Lab. As an associate professor at the University of North Dakota for 12 years, I directed the Forensic Science Program, created a trace evidence teaching laboratory and helped undergraduate students learn more about careers in forensic science. I have also served as forensic consultant for the North Dakota State Historical Society, the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and with different medical examiner
districts throughout Florida.

of people have now been vaccinated against SARS-COV-2 and new vaccine candidates are being approved by countries around the world. Yet infection numbers and deaths continue rising worldwide, and new strains of the virus are emerging. With barely a year's worth of clinical data on protections offered by the current batch of vaccines, numerous questions remain as to just how effective these different vaccines will be in ending this pandemic.

Join us today at 2 PM ET for a discussion with vaccine and immunology experts, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). We'll answer questions on how the current COVID vaccines work (and what the differences are between the different vaccines), what sort of protection the vaccine(s) offer against current, emerging and future strains of the virus, and how the various vaccine platforms used to develop the COVID vaccines can be used to fight against future diseases. Ask us anything!

I'm a biologist by training, and the author and editor of several books about science. I have written extensively on the teaching and the public understanding of evolution, genetics and nature of science. My research and writings are interdisciplinary, combining insights from science, history of
science, philosophy of science and psychology. I believe that scholars should do our society a service by serving as public intellectuals who educate non-experts on topics, and this is a contribution I would very much like to make through my books. Evolution is one of the most important ideas in science, yet evolutionary theory has been - and still is - hotly debated in the public sphere. But why do the debates about evolution persist, despite the plentiful evidence for it? Why do people find the idea of evolution hard to understand or accept? Why do some people think of evolution as a nihilistic idea that deprives life from meaning? These are the central questions of my new book
Understanding Evolution.

Ask me anything about:

+ evolution in the public sphere
+ evolution and religion
+ the conceptual obstacles to understanding evolution
+ the development of Darwin&amp;#39;s theory
+ the most important evolutionary concepts
+ evolution and scientism

Many of you readers probably have intuitions about [how people with a more ""musical ear"" might have a leg up while learning a new language](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00327/full), or about how musical talent runs in families, or that children's music skills may be affected by the musical environment to which they are exposed.

But did you know that what scientists are learning about music, genetics, and the brain may even be important for our understanding of childhood speech-language development? In 2015 [we showed that children's rhythm skills are predictive of their spoken language skills](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/11/141105101238.htm).  Many studies have also found that people with reading disability and speech problems are more likely to have difficulty with music rhythm. Our [recent paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcs.1528) reviewed evidence for a new framework about rhythm and speech-language development. Discoveries in this emerging area could help solve an urgent public health problem, which is that many children with language problems are not getting identified or treated!

+ **Reyna Gordon, PhD** (/u/Reyna_Gordon): I am an Assistant Professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where I direct the Music Cognition Lab (/u/VandyMusicCog) and also am on the faculty of the Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, the Vanderbilt Brain Institute, and the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center. My research group's interdisciplinary research program is focused on the relationship between rhythm and language abilities from behavioral, cognitive, neural, and genetic perspectives. I am passionate about [training students and staff to work across traditional disciplinary boundaries](https://www.vumc.org/music-cognition-lab/publication/interprofessional-education-next-generation-musician-scientists-through-music-cognition). I hold a PhD in Complex Systems and Brain Sciences, and before I became a cognitive neuroscientist, I was a classically trained singer (my Bachelor's degree is in Vocal Arts!).
+ **Eniko Ladanyi, PhD**. I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Music Cognition Lab of Vanderbilt University Medical Center. I have degrees in linguistics and cognitive science and my current research focuses on associations between rhythm and language skills in typical and atypical speech/language development. I use EEG and behavioral tests to investigate whether rhythm skills at infancy can predict childhood speech/language development and whether children with low speech/language skills also show low rhythm skills. I hope my research will eventually improve screening and therapy of children with speech or language disorders.
+ **Daniel Gustavson, PhD**. I am a Research Instructor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Trained in cognitive psychology and behavior genetics, I use twin studies and measured genetic data to understand how cognitive abilities relate to everyday behaviors such as procrastination, impulsivity, goal management, and (most recently) music engagement. I'm also interested in how our cognitive abilities (like memory and self-control) change over the course of the lifespan, and what types of factors help us improve the most through childhood and keep us most resilient to decline in old age. I play a range of instruments including guitar, drums, and harmonica.
+ **Olivia Boorom MS, CCC-SLP**. (/u/OliviaBoorom) I am a certified speech-language pathologist at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Music Cognition Lab. I use behavioral measures to investigate how language and social communication skills relate to rhythmicity, and how the natural rhythms of our daily interactions impact language development in children with Autism spectrum disorder and Developmental Language Disorder. I'm also interested in how music can be used as a tool to support parents and clinicians during everyday activities and during intervention. Before becoming a clinician I was an avid flute player!
+ **Srishti Nayak, PhD.** I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at the Music Cognition Lab studying the biological bases of speech rhythms (prosody) and its relationships to musical rhythm and language development. My training is in Developmental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience methods, and my work investigates how language environments early in life shape cognitive and neural development. Relatedly, I am interested in how different ""domains"" of cognition - e.g. our attention system or our emotional brain - interact with language. Given my longstanding interest in language as both an environmental *input*, and an *outcome*, my current work investigates bidirectional links between music and language skills, and the possible neural and genetic basis underlying individual variation in these skills.
+ **Anna Kasdan, BS**. I am a third year PhD candidate in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at Vanderbilt University. Broadly, I study the neural basis of rhythm in both neurotypical individuals and in individuals with Williams syndrome and aphasia, using neuroimaging techniques such as EEG as well as behavioral measures.

I'm S. ""Bala"" Balachandar, a professor in the mechanical and aerospace engineering department at the University of Florida College of Engineering. Right now, I'm leading a study of aerosols and multiphase flow to determine how far droplets can travel and infect others. During the COVID-19 global pandemic, many safety guidelines currently set in place have been determined by outdated science that says we will be safe if we are six feet apart from a sick person.

I'm here to answer any questions you may have on the science behind virus travel, airborne transmission/host-to-host transmission, how inhalation and exhalation transmit a virus and the way particle sizes affect transmission.

At the University of Florida, my teaching interests are:

+ Computational fluid science
+ Large scale simulation of complex flows
+ Transition and turbulence
+ Multiphase flows
+ Environmental flows

In July 2015, New Horizons became the first spacecraft to explore Pluto and its moons. Recently, the spacecraft - which is more than four billion miles from home and speeding toward interstellar space - took images of the stars Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359 from its unique vantage point in deep space. Scientists combined these images with pictures of the same stars taken near the same time from Earth, creating stereo images that instantly demonstrate the parallax effect astronomers have long used to measure distances to stars. New Horizons is humankind's farthest photographer, imaging an alien sky. Why does New Horizons ""see"" these stars in a different place in the sky than on Earth? How are these images sent back from New Horizons? How long does it take the team on the ground to send commands to the spacecraft? Where is New Horizons headed next?

Example
Lets take the famous .50 BMG sniper rifle round. Basic research gave me the following: (subject to variance depending on round type)

Mass: 45 g 
Muzzle Velocity: 900 m/s
Penetration: roughly 30 mm rolled homogenous armor (RHA) at close range 90 degree impact. Thats over an inch of steel in freedom units so not too shabby!

What would the RHA penetration be in the following scenarios holding all else constant?

A) Double bullet mass (90 g and 900 m/s)
B) Double bullet velocity (45 g and 1800 m/s)

These scenarios both double the momentum but only A doubles the energy, so heres a bonus:

C) Double energy thru velocity (45 g  and 1273 m/s)

Final points:
For A, I'm assuming the way you go about doubling the bullet mass matters. How would a bullet with double the density fare against one thats simply twice as long?

Also I am aware that modern propellants cant get a bullet to 1800 m/s. That being said, magnetic railguns or new plasma/liquid propellents could which makes it interesting to consider.

I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:

1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs’ effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media’s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people’s hopes for a cure to get revenue.

2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?

3. What are the major hurdles to actually “curing” cancer universally?

Here are a few examples of “breakthrough” articles and research going back to 2009, if you’re interested:

In some maps of tectonic plates, I see a new tectonic plate that I didn't know existed before that covers much of Southeast Asia and China called the ""Indo-Chinese"" plate. But, in most maps I don't see such a plate depicted, and I just see the area as being part of the Eurasian Plate. I don't even see a Wikipedia article about the ""Indo Chinese"" plate. Is this a newly discovered tectonic plate? When was it discovered?

These are the maps I'm talking about:

I am the principal investigator of The Matter Lab at the University of Toronto, a faculty Member at the Vector Institute, and a CIFAR Fellow. I am also a co-founder of Kebotix and Zapata Computing. Kebotix aims to disrupt chemistry by building self-driving laboratories. Zapata develops algorithms and tools for quantum computing.

The publication named these technological advances as two of its 10 [Breakthrough Technologies](https://www.technologyreview.com/lists/technologies/2020/) of 2020. 

A couple of things that have been in my mind in the recent years that we can talk about are listed below:

+ What is the role of scientists in society at large? In this world at a crossroads, how can we balance efficiently the workloads and expectations to help society both advance fundamental research but also apply our discoveries and translate them to action as soon as possible?
+ What is our role as scientists in the emergent world of social echo chambers? How can we take our message across to bubbles that are resistant and even hostile to science facts.
+ What will the universities of the future look like?
+ How will science at large, and chemistry in particular, be impacted by AI, quantum computing and robotics?
+ Of course, feel free to ask any questions about any of our [publications](https://matter.toronto.edu/publications/). I will do my best to answer in the time window or refer you to group members that can expand on it.
+ Finally, surprise me with other things! AMA!

I'm aware that dehydration disrupts a plethora of biological processes which leads to a variety of things going wrong in our body. But there must be one (or perhaps a few?) factor(s) that eventually lead to death.   
Is it the hypovolemic shock? Is it perhaps dyselectrolytemia?   


I have a vague memory in my mind that it's because of hyponatremia, but that doesn't make much sense. We only lose sodium through our sweat and can replenish it from food, which means if we avoid an environment that causes us to sweat and eat enough, that'll prolongue our chances of surviving without watter. Sounds ridiculous.   


Hypernatremia makes more sense. If we don't drink water, we lose water content while our sodium stays relatively the same (we lose some through sweat, but sweat is quite low in sodium and we would lose more water than sodium anyways).

I focus on whether non-human animals share some of the cognitive biases that plague humans. My [TED talk explored whether monkeys make the same financial mistakes as humans](https://www.ted.com/talks/laurie_santos) and has been viewed over 1.3 million times.

My new course, [Psychology and the Good Life](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/nyregion/at-yale-class-on-happiness-draws-huge-crowd-laurie-santos.html), teaches students how the science of psychology can provide important hints about how to make wiser choices and live a life that's happier and more fulfilling. The course recently became Yale's most popular course in over 300 years, with almost one of our four students at Yale enrolled. The course has been featured in numerous news outlets including the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/nyregion/at-yale-class-on-happiness-draws-huge-crowd-laurie-santos.html), [NBC Nightly News](https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/yale-s-most-popular-class-is-teaching-students-how-to-lead-happier-lives-1155185731525), [The Today Show](https://www.today.com/video/meet-yale-professor-who-teaches-a-course-on-happiness-1191222851857), [GQ Magazine](https://www.gq.com/story/laurie-santos-how-to-be-happy-interview), [Slate](https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/01/happiness-101-college-courses-are-a-mental-health-stop-gap.html) and [Oprah.com](http://www.oprah.com/inspiration/laurie-santos-happiness-research).

I'm aware of various tools for doing difficult integrals (e.g. using the residue theorem), but what I'm curious about here are integration techniques in which shapes other than polygons are used as a basis for deriving those analytic integration techniques. For example I could imagine using conic sections or hermite polynomials or the gamma function or something equally strange to build up an integration technique with respect to non elementary functions, where integrating (using such a technique) x^n might be extraordinarily difficult, but integrating some non elementary function may be trivial. Are there are a toolset of such techniques?

Perhaps someone can help me understand these a little better.

In the simplest example, a sigma bond between two hydrogen atoms, there is a sigma bond orbital in which the electron density is right between the two nuclei, or alternatively, a node in the middle, and a density right at each nuclei. So presumably, in either of these, the total energy is less than in it would be when the same two electrons are in two separate s orbitals on two separate atoms. (Otherwise the sigma bond would never form.)

Now in the case of helium, such a bond never forms, but it is not clear to me that I understand the reason. It would still be the case that such a bond would leave those two electrons at a lower total energy than they would be at if they were in two separate s orbitals. I am guessing the reason is that the remaining two electrons in the s orbitals would have to be brought so close together, in the process of forming the sigma bond, that they would be at a higher energy, and that would outweigh the lower energy of the electrons in the sigma bond orbital. Is this correct?

If so, then I have to ask about the other sigma bond, the ""anti-bonding"" orbital, which appears to be a sigma bond orbital in which there is a single node right in between the nuclei (some sources appear to say that this is the typical sigma bond orbital of H2). In that case, the density is greatest right around the two nuclei, even though it is a bonded orbital. So it would seem at first glance that this bond could exist at the same time as the first sigma bond orbital, and that in the case of helium, all four electrons would be at a lower energy than they would in the separate s orbitals. However, it appears that two simultaneous sigma bonds of this type never form. So I have to ask what prevents it.

Last, I have to ask why beryllium does not have the same type of inertness as helium, because it is also characterized by a full s orbital in the ground state, and yet, it appears to form sigma bonds of exactly that type, that is, a sigma bond orbital and sigma antibonding orbital. Am I correct about this? If so, why does the same thing not happen to helium or neon?

I am guessing that the bonds formed in these compounds of beryllium involve different sigma bonds types that _can_ form simultaneously. Is this correct? I am also guessing that beryllium itself is brittle and not very useful because of this full s orbital, even though it does not make it totally inert. Am I correct about this, also?

""We now have time and distance intervals in the same currency. For example, they could both be given in meters, or miles or light-years or whatever. Figure  illustrates two events in spacetime, denoted by little crosses. The bottom line is that we want a rule for figuring out how far apart the two events are in spacetime. Looking at the figure, we want to know the length of the hypotenuse given the lengths of the other two sides. To be a little more precise, we shall label the length of the base of the triangle as x while the height is ct. It means that the two events are a distance x apart in space and a distance ct apart in time. Our goal, then, is to answer the question “what is the hypotenuse, s, in terms of x and ct?” Making contact with our ear- lier example x = 10 meters is the distance in space from bed to kitchen table, and t = 1 hour is the distance in time. So far, since c was arbitrary, ct can be anything and we appear to be treading water. We shall press onward nonetheless. 
We have to decide on a means of measuring the length of the hypotenuse, the distance between two events in spacetime. Should we choose Euclidean space, in which case we can use Pythagoras’ theorem, or something more complicated? Perhaps our space should be curved like the surface of the earth, or maybe some other more complicated shape. There are in fact an infinite number of ways that we might imagine calculating distances..........In our case, the simplest way to construct a distance is to assume that at least the space part of our spacetime should be Euclidean; in other words, space is flat. This means that the familiar way of working out the distance in space be- tween objects in the room in which we are seated reading this book is carried over into our new framework intact. What could be simpler? The question, then, is how we should add time. Another simplifying assumption is that our spacetime is unchanging and the same everywhere........these two simplifying assumptions, we are left with only two possible choices as to how to calculate distances in spacetime. The length of the hypotenuse must be either s2 = (ct)2 + x2 or s2 = (ct)2 - x2. There is no other option. Although we did not prove it, our assumption that spacetime should be unchanging and the same everywhere leads to only these two possibilities and we must pick either the plus sign or the minus sign.""",True,False,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,15264383.0,public,self,From the book E=mc2 and why should we care (Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw).

Today is Albert Einstein's birthday and we're here to answer all of your Einstein-related questions.

His most famous achievement is arguably the development of the [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) in 1915. General relativity is an extremely well-tested theory of gravity, with implications for mechanics, astrophyiscs, cosmology, and more. It has been a hot topic lately with the direct detection of [gravitational waves](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-are-gw).

Besides his work in gravity, Einstein was known for a great many other things. In 1921 he received the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the [photoelectric effect](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/einstein-s-legacy-the-photoelectric-effect/). He also worked on thermodynamic/statistical physics (such as [Brownian motion](http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/152.mf1i.spring02/BrownianMotion.htm) and [Bose-Einstein statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_statistics)), the famous [mass-energy equivalence](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equivME/), [atomic physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_coefficients), [quantum mechaincs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Brillouin%E2%80%93Keller_method), and more.

However, in certain computer circuits, such as latches, data can be stored permanently by looping an output wire back into the input of the circuit. For instance, in an AND-OR Latch, you could store a value of 'one' by inputting S as 'one' and R as 'zero' and then changing S to 'zero' as well. But how is this 'one' value (implying current) retained in the circuit indefinitely when both of its inputs have been set to 'zero' (no current input)? Wouldn't the electrons flowing in the wire eventually lose their kinetic energy to the wire's resistance and destroy the value stored in the circuit?

I subjected my material to a 1% deformation and a frequency of 1rad/s to establish over which time my materials is showing constant behavior so I can properly do follow-up measurements.

I noticed that the viscosity is starting out on a plateau, then dropping to a lower plateau after a certain time and then, when the material starts to dry out, is rising, as expected.

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/2UiyE) is an example (for confidential stuff reasons I had to remove the values). The x-axis is the time and the y-axis the dynamic viscosity.

To give a bit more detail: After some time the material starts to dry out so the viscosity (and the modules) are rising, which is to be expected. When looking at in a double logarithmic scale, this of course turns into a nice straight line, but there is, for all measurements, a drop of about 4Pas to a lower plateau.

**UPDATE**: Thanks for all the great comments, everyone. This kinda blew up so I figured I'd honor the attention this question got and consolidate some of the basic info shared in several comments I found particularly enlightening. Obviously I'll save the gritty details for the comments that supplied them. This can just function as a TLDR.

First of all, I'm gonna limit what I put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like Egyptian, Mayan, Greek and Latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken English and IPA usage. Really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. 

* Latin, Greek and Mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. Several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. 

* Greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken Egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the Rosetta Stone. When Greeks invaded Egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. Many Egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. 

* (This I found super interesting) Names/words ending in ""is/us/os"" are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this Greek language infusion. This means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. 

* In the example of Tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of Coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (Tut, Ankh, and Amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. The appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by u/goltrpoat: As an example, ""Tutankhamen"" (twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn) was likely pronounced as something like ""Tawat 'ankhu qaman"" ([taˈwaːt ˈʕaːnxu ʔaˈmaːn]).

* Finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. Someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for ""mouth"" may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word (""ro"") and the sound that character represents. This part seems kind of confusing and I might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. See u/Ramast 's comment to see his full explanation on this point.

For example, If I were standing at the North Pole, the large masses of earth underneath Africa, north America, and Australia are all exerting a force on my body, but all at different angles—It’s only the accumulated force of all the particles of the earth pulling at me that average out to be straight down right? Since gravity is a vector, don’t different particles at different points on the Earth, “Cancel out” some of the effects of the others?

So my question is—when calculating the pull of gravity precisely, wouldn’t one need the variables of mass, distance *and* the shape and volume of the object to get accurate results? I guess if you’re doing math for gravity, the object will probably be spherical, but wouldn’t a single point with the same mass as the Earth at x distance from an object have a more *direct* pull of gravity than the Earth itself at x distance and thus a greater magnitude? If the Earth instantly compressed down to a single point at the center of it’s core, would it accelerate me more than 9.8 m/s^2 towards it?

(I realize all the mass between me and the core would be that much further away, and thus have less influence, but all the mass on the far side of the earth would be that much closer as well, I’m just wondering how much focusing gravity would increase it).
	
This is just a curiosity question that I couldn’t find any information on. I’m not that good at math, but is there any source that talks about calculating for this?

I've begun playing around with Kerbal Space Program and there are some things that are unclear to me when it comes to orbital mechanics.

In orbital mechanics, speed and altitude are linked: a satellite or a ship orbits a body at a given altitude and a given speed (at least that's what I understand). If I increase the speed (by burning prograde) I will ~~increase~~ decrease my altitude and _vice versa_.

I also understand that if I burn normal (or antinormal) I increase (decrease) the angle of my orbit: this seems easy to understand when summing speed vectors.

What I don't get is burning radial out / in. Suppose I'm orbiting the body at 2000m/s @ 100km. If I burn radial out (away from the body), I will increase my altitude (because I'm providing thrust in that direction).
Then if I stop burning, let's say I'm now at 110km altitude, what happens? Well I'm at 110km altitude for which the orbital speed is supposed to be 2100m/s (for instance, haven't made the calculations), but I'm still going 2000m/s because I haven't accelerated in the direction I'm orbiting. So the ship / satellite should begin to lose altitude to get back to 100km, right?

Or am I missing something?

Another question that is related: how is it even possible to do orbital rendez-vous?

I mean if I'm trying to rendez-vous with a satellite orbiting the body at a certain speed (and thus altitude). If I come from ""under"", meaning if I have a lower altitude, then I have a higher speed. So I'm ""gaining"" on it. Suppose I time my prograde burn so that I rise to the target altitude (and speed) but I'm a few kilometers ahead of the target. Then I'm toasted right? Because if I'm a few kilometers ahead of the satellite and try to slow down a bit by burning retrograde so that it can catch up on me, then I'm also lowering my orbit.

I get that we have computer models that make very powerful computations, but when we are talking about docking a ship to the ISS, I suppose the computer models cannot compute a single burn that will place the ship at _exactly_ the correct position and speed, at mm/s and mm accuracy. So there has to be adjustment burns, even minor ones. But since altitude and speeds are always linked, how does one position exactly at the correct speed and altitude?

Sorry if this is obvious, but something's not ticking with me on this one :/

Now I've done the problem (which asks for time to max height, and distance travelled to max height, as well as total time for flight) using forces [ ma = -kv^2 -mg (going up) , and ma = kv^2 - mg (going down) ] but I was wondering if it would be possible to use Lagrangian equations to solve this.

From what I understand I need a dissipating function to account for the energy lost because of the air drag, and I think I can use the Rayleigh dissipation function defined as, F = (1/2)k(dy/dt)^2 Then when I put the dissipation function into my equation I would set the negative partial derivative of F with respect to the partial derivative of y(dot) equal to the Lagrange equation?

At this point am I on the right track?

Consider this example: We are in empty space and ignore gravitational effects. There is an asteroid and a spaceship.

An observer on the asteroid measures zero rotational speed and zero acceleration using a gyroscope and accelerometer. Thus the asteroid creates an inertial frame of reference.

An observer on the spaceship measures some rotational speed and acceleration using a gyroscope and accelerometer. Thus the spaceship creates an non-inertial frame of reference.

Coordinate system A is fixed and referenced to the asteroid. The velocity vector of the spaceship `v_A` (measured w.r.t. A) has some non-zero value.

Coordinate system S is fixed and referenced to the spaceship. The velocity vector of the spaceship `v_S` (measured w.r.t. S) is (by definition) zero.

Coordinate system K is fixed to the spaceship BUT referenced to the asteroid. The velocity vector of the spaceship `v_K` (measured w.r.t. K) has the same magnitude as `v_A` but a different direction. The spaceship's rotation matrix `R` connects them: `v_A = R * v_K`.

I've had classes that used either S or K as a ""body coordinate system"". But I haven't seen an explicit distinction between the two. Can someone clarify the terminology and notation here?

I assume here, that in the definition of a coordinate system one can specify a ""fixed to"" body and a ""referenced to"" body independently.

The moon doesn’t have an atmosphere like earths so it wouldn’t burn up before striking the surface. 
Does Voyager travel fast enough to damage the moon in any significant way or would we notice any effect? Or is it simply too small to be nothing more than another negligible crater?

If it were traveling that fast towards earth (and for some reason had a heat shield/was durable enough to withstand atmospheric disintegration) would its speed cause an extinction event such as the meteor that killed the dinosaurs? I ask since Voyagers mass is much smaller than the meteor’s.

I know that objects falling towards earth have a specific terminal velocity that can’t be passed, but Voyager is traveling so much faster than that. Would the atmosphere really slow it down to a terminal velocity or would it simply rip right through? 
Maybe I’m just not understanding that right.

I know this is a hypothetical question but I don’t think it requires speculation since we’re using real variables here. I’m more interested in how a small satellite traveling that fast would affect larger bodies.

Abstract
Aims
The debate on the funding and availability of cytotoxic drugs raises questions about the contribution of curative or adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy to survival in adult cancer patients.

Materials and methods
We undertook a literature search for randomised clinical trials reporting a 5-year survival benefit attributable solely to cytotoxic chemotherapy in adult malignancies. The total number of newly diagnosed cancer patients for 22 major adult malignancies was determined from cancer registry data in Australia and from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data in the USA for 1998. For each malignancy, the absolute number to benefit was the product of (a) the total number of persons with that malignancy; (b) the proportion or subgroup(s) of that malignancy showing a benefit; and (c) the percentage increase in 5-year survival due solely to cytotoxic chemotherapy. The overall contribution was the sum total of the absolute numbers showing a 5-year survival benefit expressed as a percentage of the total number for the 22 malignancies.

Results
The overall contribution of curative and adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy to 5-year survival in adults was estimated to be 2.3% in Australia and 2.1% in the USA.

Conclusion
As the 5-year relative survival rate for cancer in Australia is now over 60%, it is clear that cytotoxic chemotherapy only makes a minor contribution to cancer survival. To justify the continued funding and availability of drugs used in cytotoxic chemotherapy, a rigorous evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and impact on quality of life is urgently required.

In this book I found by chance on Google, the author claims that “solutions of the wave equation only take the form of functions (...) in one and three dimensions. In two dimensions solutions are more complex”. Then, at the end of the paragraph of interest (which I posted the print here) he claims that in two dimensions, backward propagating terms are present but that is not the case for one and three dimensions.

As I have learned on multiple sources, the difference between odd and even dimensions is that on even dimensions the wave equation gives rise to infinite velocities for the propagation, creating a sharp wave front but diffuse tail. There’s a pretty great reddit post which clarifies exactly that (https://www.google.com.br/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/37xu2m/how_do_evendimensional_waves_behave/), but there’s no mention of backward propagating waves, just different velocities.

With that in mind, what did the author of the book mean by “backward propagating terms”? Could his interpretation be wrong? Am I missing something?

For example, the constant pressure heat capacity Cp is defined similarly through a partial derivative as (∂H/∂T)_p. What this directly represents is the change in heat respective to the change in temperature while holding pressure constant, however in a gas it is much more significant when understood in terms of intermolecular interactions; complex gas molecules can absorb some of the incoming energy through their vibrational states/bonds/etc, which therefore lessens the change in temperature due because not all of the incoming energy goes to influencing ΔT.

We are a plant ecology research lab at Monmouth University. We recently conducted a study investigating community succession after abandonment in abandoned cranberry bogs within the New Jersey Pinelands. Since the 1860's, the cultivation of the native American cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon, has been a major agricultural practice in the New Jersey pinelands. The pinelands have been well suited for cranberry production due to the sandy, organically rich soil and abundant sources of freshwater. Although cranberry agriculture can represent over a third of wetlands in the pinelands, the industry has been on the decline as it has moved to other regions of the country. As a result, many bogs have been abandoned. The effects of abandonment have not been investigated thoroughly. 

In this study, we explored the fate of bogs and examined bog succession after abandonment from time zero (an active cranberry bog) to 60 years abandoned in flooded and unflooded communities. A full inventory of plant and invertebrate species were collected from cranberry bogs of different ages from three locations. Community diversity and structure were determined from the inventories and a chronosequence for bog succession was developed. When a cranberry bog was left to dry, conversion from a wet savanna to either a mesic mixed forest or wooded swamp was observed. A cranberry bog that remained flooded transitioned to a lake, spung, or pond. With this information, recommendations can be made onto how the lands should be managed in the future in order to maintain healthy and native communities.

I guess the tl;dr here is ""what's so special about light that it happens to travel at the speed of causality?"" Is there some intrinsic relationship between photons/particles lacking mass and causality/information? Or is this just one of those ""That's how the Universe works; we don't [yet] know why, or even if there is a particular reason"" ? Could also be a sort of chicken vs. egg question; please read on with my apologies for failing to express these thoughts concisely.

From what I understand, c (~3 x 10^8 m/s) is the speed of causality, or of information. So, if parties A and B are spacelike-separated by some distance D meters, and an event X occurs in the immediate vicinity of party A, party B cannot be aware of that event until (at the earliest) D / c seconds later. So if party B is ~9 x 10^8 meters from party A, party B cannot possibly know that the event X has occurred until *at least* 3 seconds has passed (let's say parties A and B are in the same inertial frame to avoid relativistic effects for now).

Fine; I can accept that as a physical rule of our Universe. There is some finite maximum speed at which information can propagate.

What I don't understand is why light / massless particles are so fundamentally related to causality so as to have an identical propagation speed. Is it because information can be conveyed by almost any conceivable means, so if information about an event happens to be carried by massless particles, and massless particles travel at a particular maximum speed, which happens to be the highest speed we've ever observed, we conclude that causality travels at the same speed?

If THAT preceding paragraph is true, then how do we prove that causality cannot propagate faster than c and we simply remain unaware of any means by which to test/falsify that hypothesis, since the fastest way we know to verify the propagation of causality is via (generally) EM radiation/photons?

Is this just a really extended question about the proof of the relativity of simultaneity and I'm just going about thinking about it in an extremely convoluted, flawed fashion? I am aware of the scenarios postulated showing that traveling faster than light would effectively result in traveling backwards in time, causing a paradox, but don't they all hinge upon the assumption that the speed of light *IS* the speed of causality, rather than the possibility that the speed of light is slower than the speed of causality?

I feel like I'm missing something relatively simple making this a sort of dumb question.

Maybe a better tl;dr: What is the proof that the speed of light in a vacuum is exactly equal to the speed of causality, instead of the speed of light in a vacuum potentially being slower than that of causality, even if we are unaware of any phenomena traveling faster than light (or even if no such phenomena other than causality itself exist)?

I was laying in bed trying to sleep, and naturally, my brain started contemplating scientific questions. From what I've gathered, one issue with spacecraft driven by the reactive force applied on it when it ejects matter away from itself, is that it has a finite amount of matter to eject away, thus limiting the amount of movement it can generate (Δv..?). I assume that the availability of matter in outer space is quite limited (unless you find a body travelling roughly the same speed and direction as you, harvest matter from it, and use that as new matter for further acceleration), but then the idea mentioned in the title struck me. 

I mostly hear talk about converting matter into energy, but I would assume (and think I might have heard it mentioned) that there are theoretical possibilities of doing it the other way around; turning energy into matter. The famous E=mc² equation also instinctively strikes me as something you could turn on its head, though this is something I know absolutely nothing about. 

Something that there *is* an availability of in space, at least if my impressions are correct, is energy, in the form of light - or at least electromagnetic radiation. If you were to design a contraption capable of generating matter from the energy captured by the spacecraft, and then use some more of the captured energy to eject the generated matter opposite of the direction you wanted to go, would this be a (very theoretical) way of providing a spacecraft with unlimited Δv? 

I feel like I've answered some aspects of my question myself by now, but first of all I'm wondering if what I've assumed so far is correct, and if so, I'm curious about how possible this would be even on a theoretical level, and also a somewhat practical one.

I don't know much about the relations between matter and energy, but there is for example a chance that the numbers would be ridiculous. For all I know, with a solar panel the size of the Milky Way capturing 100% of the energy hitting it, and a machine converting that energy into 100% of the matter theoretically available, you would be able to accelerate 1 kg of matter 3 m/s in one direction every one billion years. Then this wouldn't be possible even on a theoretical level. This is what I'm curious about.  Is this possible at all, and if so, just *how* possible is it?",,False,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,self,"Would it be theoretically possible to turn energy collected from solar panels into matter, before ejecting said matter through some sort of nozzle, as a way of having ""unlimited"" fuel for a spacecraft?",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6sj6pv/would_it_be_theoretically_possible_to_turn_energy/,,,,,,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead of sending electrical signals and using transistors to represent bits, wouldn't it be better if we used light and photodiodes (I hope that's the correct component). This thought came after seeing the evolution of the way we send data, from sending data over copper wires to sending them as light pulses through optical fibres. Can the same thing be implemented with the way computers run? Given that, is it possible to store data as light?

I've been reading a few books and watching documentaries on black holes and it's really fascinated me. From what I understand, Stephen Hawking has theorised that black holes emit Hawking radiation which makes them shrink, lose mass and evaporate. Does this mean that black holes essentially cancel themselves out into nothing? If so, could black holes be essentially forced to lose mass by sending controlled radiation into them? If not, do we know what would happen if radiation was sent into a black hole?

Also, when a black hole does eventually lose so much mass it disappears, do they leave anything behind other than radiation to suggest they were there? Or do they simply cease to exist? (I'm sure I read that nothing can simply cease to exist, which is why I ask.) For example, years later, would there be any way to detect where a black hole used to be? 

I've also read that there is a large black hole in the centre of our galaxy, and then other things which say we might be living inside of a black hole. If so, does this mean we're living inside a black hole with a black hole inside the black hole and so on and so fourth? So black holes within black holes?

It's basically scientific research done for free (but it's amazing for your curriculum, like unbelievably amazing. Not that i care too much about that right now, as all i want is to pursue rigorous scientific research). 

All that being said, my idea is to create a project about building new lab equipment, experiments as required, etc. So the college labs could be more well suited for students to learn by tackling real problems head on, creating incentives to even more PAICS(I believe some people don't do it as often because of the reasons stated above) and maybe , in my wildest dreams, if enough is done, have the structure ready for a physics engineering major(this is a 10 years from now goal, but you gotta start somewhere, right?) 

So I need your help to understand what can be built, what can't and if so, why it can't be.

Now when a spacecraft re-enters the atmosphere, it uses the atmosphere as a breaking mechanism strong enough to land safely on earth, and it already uses the upper part of the atmosphere for much of the speed reduction. This would suggest *bad things*^TM would happen to a spacecraft going orbital speeds at sea level.

However, spacecraft are usually aerodynamically designed specifically to use the atmosphere for breaking, rather than trying to minimize drag and punch through the atmosphere. 

So thats my question - Would a spacecraft launched with orbital speeds(in the range of 6-10 km/s) designed with minimizing aerodynamic drag be capable of escaping the atmosphere intact? Would it still have a reasonable amount of speed left?(as in, would it leave the atmosphere with 90% of its original speed, or 10% of its original speed?)

As in any two of the hands are at 180 degrees and the third one is perpendicular to both hands. 

I tried to solve it using vectors. I assumed the clock is a unit circle, and the three hands all have length of 1 unit, therefore the hands can be described by trig vectors in relation to time. I assumed that the second (**s**) and the minute hands (**m**) are parallel at the instant, and using the rules of dot product, |**s** • **m**| = |**s**||**m**|, but as **s** and **m** are unit vectors, |**s** • **m**|=1. Then the hour hand (**h**) has to be perpendicular to both of them, therefore **h**•**s**=**h**•**m**=0.

But **h**•**s**=**h**•**m**=0 and |**s** • **m**|=1 are two long trig equation where the variable t can be anything between 0 and 43200 (I wrote the position vectors in terms of seconds, and there are 43200 seconds in 12 hours). Each has a ton of solutions and it's incredibly difficult to find a common result, also the other combinations (hour is parallel to minute hand, hour is parallel to second hand) have to be tried, which makes the process more difficult.

I'm wondering whether there's an easier way to solve for this problem, or if there's a way to solve my equations. Note it's possible that the equations may have no solutions, which means that there isn't an instant in time where the second and minute hands are at 180 degrees while the hour hand is perpendicular to both. Also, if there is no solution on a continuous clock, are there solutions for a discontinuous clock? As in the hands only point at the 60 markings directly and never at the gaps between them.

For those interested here are my position vectors for the hands:

* **s**=[cos(90 - 6t), sin(90 - 6t)]
* **m**=[cos(90 - t/10], sin(90 - t/10)]
* **h**=[cos(90 - t/120], sin(90 - t/120)]

I noticed that if layers are added to the top, the sequence more and more closely approximates 2^(i-1) close to i = 0. The next layer would be, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 63, 120, …


If S(L)(i) represents the i^th element of layer L, with layer 1 being the bottom, then S(L)(i) = S(L)(i-1) + S(L-1)(i-1) &amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp; S(L)(1) = 1. Starting with the bottom layer and working up using summation notation and algebra, I found that

S(1)(i) = 1;

S(2)(i) = i;

S(3)(i) = 1+i(i-1)/2;

S(4)(i) = (i^3 -3i^2 +8i)/6    

etc.


It looks like the largest power in each layer is L-1, but then why does it seem heuristically that S(infinity)(i) = 2^(i-1) ? I believe a lower sequence here is, in a way, similar to a derivative function for the sequence above, so I considered this stack might resemble a polynomial approximation similar to a Taylor series at different expansion levels. However, the Taylor series for 2^(i-1) around 0 contains only logs at the different expansion levels I checked.

**Questions:** I was wondering if there is a closed form solution for S(L)(i) in terms of L and i? If there is a closed form solution for this particular “stack” of sequences, does a closed form solution always exist for ""stacks"" of sequences such as these? I'm not sure that since the functions themselves are changing and at discrete jumps, that the concept of a limit even remotely applies. However, is there a reason that it seems the limit as L -&gt; infinity of S(L)(i) is equal to 2^(i-1)?

1) The first one has to do with the formula for deriving Gravitational Potential Energy. I learned that, for the derivation of Gravitational Potential Energy given large distances, we have to use the mathematical analytic way to derive an expression for it at a given distance.

To do so, you need integrate F dot dr from r to infinity. However, what I don't understand are as follows:

- Why do we need to take the zero point at r = infinity? Why can't I take it from any arbitrary point to get a general expression for its GPE when I integrate?

- Why is the work required to push an object to that height equal to the force due to gravity times the distance? Don't I need to apply a force that overcomes the force due to gravity to even raise it to begin with? Fg * h is definitely greater in magnitude than fg, but if I'm applying work to an object equal to Fg * h in the *opposite* direction of where it wants to move (towards the dominant object's COM) how do I know the magnitude of that work is sufficient to do so? 

If I was trying to figure out how much energy I need to give an object to raise it from one point in space to another relative to, say the Earth, I could take the change in energy from the two points. If its energy at its initial point is 2 and the energy at the point I want it to be at is 8, I need to supply 6 joules to it. But how do I reconcile that with the derivation from the above paragraph?

2) The second question has to do with zero points for potential energy. Is this allowed because, as long as the distance from each object relative to another is the same no matter where I place a zero point, everything resolves? If at point A, object 1 is 2 units from point A and object 2 is 5 units from point A (all in, say, the x axis), then I'm not cheating by taking point B to be at object 1's position and saying object 2 is now 3 units from point B, right? Wouldn't its potential energy then change here though? That's okay because it's all relative, right? But the magnitude changes.. that's okay?

Mainly I don't really understand how radio waves work. I presented several question here, in order for you to help me understand, but the big question is ""**how do radio waves work?**""

Let's start with location - PC1 (the black one) receives data from the router (the red one). This can also apply to FM radio. If I move my laptop, I still receive the same data, so there are waves of information everywhere - but each second it transmits different data, meaning that near the transmitting station, there is a different data that the one that had to travel all the way to the other end of the room/house/street. So why moving the receiver doesn't disrupt the signal?

Now look at the blue waves - they hit the wall and get back to the receiver ( waves do get projected from walls right? Well I don't know about wifi, but there are different types of waves right? ) so the receiver gets at least 2 different signal at any given time. Shouldn't it also disrupt the signal? If we talk about a wifi for a second - in every part of the room there are different set of ""1""s and ""0""s, and it received ""1""s and ""0""s simultaneously from all the wall projections.

Additional info: I was radio specialist in the army in my country, was AP physics in high school and currently doing computer science major. So I do now understand that specific topic, but I do have some background if you don't want to ELI5.

**Clarification**: Well this is a hard question to write without a picture so I did some horrible job with paint ( I don't have Photoshop on the pc ).",,False,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,self,How radio (and wifi) waves don't interfere with each other and send the same information to every location?,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/63fzun/how_radio_and_wifi_waves_dont_interfere_with_each/,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'tW7_bEetOjdZpl9zYE_Apyxeo7_2cV62RC-q3jarHKg', 'resolutions': [{'height': 44, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/N7HbXEnuA6n4uzCQPppxI1L-sOcGj1YcZVcfR-kIj2o.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=89aba76ec7f837f8649beb03a66acb11', 'width': 108}, {'height': 89, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/N7HbXEnuA6n4uzCQPppxI1L-sOcGj1YcZVcfR-kIj2o.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=9573c8650a9cbb17a9a1310b85edcac4', 'width': 216}, {'height': 132, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/N7HbXEnuA6n4uzCQPppxI1L-sOcGj1YcZVcfR-kIj2o.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=181b85c938ea81e4d80e6cac1079290a', 'width': 320}, {'height': 265, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/N7HbXEnuA6n4uzCQPppxI1L-sOcGj1YcZVcfR-kIj2o.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=273f42cb97553a0e7cb97e754abc817a', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 326, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/N7HbXEnuA6n4uzCQPppxI1L-sOcGj1YcZVcfR-kIj2o.jpg?s=fc76ba1b793ddcf4c838702000e62e69', 'width': 787}, 'variants': {}}]}",,0.0,,,,True,,,,,,,1439932661.0,{},{},,,,

    E = h*f

This formula is the result of one of the first things physics students learn; finding the correlation between two variables. Students know to plot the measured data on the relevant axes and measure the gradient of the line-of-best-fit to find the constant.

Due to the mathematics of an equation, the equivalence of units must be conserved. And since Energy has the unit of Joules (J) and frequency has the unit of Hertz (s^-1), we must give give the Planck's constant (the value of which is all that matters) a unit of J*s. 

This is merely the requirement of such a mathematical equation, we could easily forego the unit-requirement with language (apologies for any inaccuracies):
&gt; Each quanta of light has an energy (in Joules) that is 6.62...*10^-34 times the frequency of said light (measured in Hertz).

It's essential that we have units for variables; they have to be measurable. On the other hand, it seems senseless to give units of measurement to a constant that merely describes the relationship.

Of course I'm not saying that we should abandon the representation of the equation. It's obvious that using the mathematics with which students are familiar (multiplication and equivalence) has many benefits in their education and acclimation to the subject and its topics. Neither am I claiming the linguistic representation is superior or inferior. Both can be used in different situations to benefit understanding.

My question to you, is whether it is the case that adherence to such an equivalence system at more advanced levels of the subject restricts the exploration of further understanding.

Or is it the case that there is some function in giving constants units, to which I am ignorant?

When [plugging those values for this OH transition into here](http://www.calctool.org/CALC/phys/default/doppler), I get  frequency widths on the order 10 MHz.

Are not these frequency widths quite large for megamasers? I was under the impression these masers resulted in narrow lines. 

Also, I was led to believe there is velocity coherence in masers, but in this case, how can a maser have a velocity width of 2200 km s^-1 ? Would not the molecules moving at different velocities result in collisions and dephasing throughout the masing region resulting in thermal equilibrium eventually? Even when looking at Figure 1, why does there appear to be two peaks as opposed to a single pulse as normally observed?

And finally, can the velocity widths theoretically be even higher than 2200 km s^-1 ?

If you look carefully, you can see a pattern that from new born to ~11 days (~2 weeks) sleeping occours manly during midniught to ~3am, however form then on to ~32 days (~5 weeks, ~2 months) most of the sleep in shifted to day time. Following this, sleeps goes back to night time getting progresively longer.

So the question is, why is there such a shift between night, day, the night again? Searching for information I found that around 6 weeks (AKA the second shift) sleeping patterns begin to become more regular and before that is mainly erratic [^1](http://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-sleep-basics-birth-to-3-months_7654.bc). However it doesn't mention anything about *only day sleeping.*

So if the first qustion doesn't have a real answer, is this a mere coincidence? or is there really a physiological, psicological, chemical, etc. change in the body?

I tried to do the math myself, here is what I came up with:

Assumptions: 

* January Outdoor Mean Temp: 34F / 1.11 C
* Ideal temperature: 102F / 38.9C
* Energy saving temperature: 87F / 30.6 C
* Tub capacity: 435 gallons
* Tub dimensions: 2.3m x 2.3m x 1m
* Tub surface area: 19.78m^2
* Tub insulation: 0.1m styrofoam (top is on, for simplicity sake treating the top as the same thickness and material as the sides)
* Thermal conductivity of styrofoam: 0.03 W/(m*C)
* specific heat of water: 4.186 j/(g*C)

First we calculate the heat transfer rate at 102F and 87F respectively using R = kA(T1-T2)/d. We can assume the energy required to maintain the tub at a constant temperature is equal to the energy lost through the sides:

    R = 0.03*19.78*(38.9-1.11)/0.1 = 224.25 J/s
    R = 0.03*19.78*(30.6-1.11)/0.1 = 175 J/s

Next we want to calculate the energy required to heat the tub from 87F to 102F, to do that we need to know the mass of water in the tub (preferably in grams). 
    
    435 gallons of water = 1650000 grams [via wolframalpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=435+gallons+of+water)

The energy required to heat the tub from 87 to 102 is then calculated using E = k*m*(T1-T2).

    E = 4.186*1650000*(38.9 - 30.6) = 57327270

Now we can compare the two methods. The first method is running the tub constantly at 102F for time t. The second method is running the tub at 87 for time t and then heating it up to 102 when you are going to use it.

    224.25t = 175t + 57327270
    solving for t gives t = 1.16401×10^6 seconds = 13 days 11 hours 20 minutes

Thus by my calculation, if he uses the tub more than once every two weeks he is losing money by turning it down to 87F. Can someone with a stronger engineering or physics background comment so that I can show him that I'm not completely full of it?

No matter how perfectly you play, some games will force you to occasionally have to make a guess, as is the case in the image that I linked too.

If we can assume that we have a perfect player, who always makes the most highest probability selections (in other words, if there is a 100% ""safe"" square, it will always pick that before attempting to guess on a 50/50 safe square, and if there is a square that has a 2/3 chance of being safe, it will pick that before picking a square that has a 50/50 chance of being safe, then what would percentage of wins would the ""perfect player"" most likely approach?

Other assumptions:

* The first click will never result in a mine exploding --&gt; the game is generated AFTER you click your first square.

* Mine placement is completely random, except for the first clicked square.

* The Mines can not change position after the board has been determined on the first click.

What that intuitively tells me is that its hue (the direction from the center gray point, for example) and its saturation (the distance from the gray point) should be independent of Y (again, for a constant (x,y)).

So what I'd expect is that if were talking about xyY space and you took (0.2,0.1,0.1) (a really dark blue) and (0.2,0.1,0.9) (a nice bright blue), and converted them both to HSB space and looked at the values, they'd have the same H and S values, but a different B value. Yet, they don't, which you can see by messing around with [this converter](http://colormine.org/convert/yxy-to-hsl) for example.

So common tips you will find are to load your magazine with one less bullet. So if your magazine can hold 15, load 14. Another tip is to swap magazines every few months. The recommendation is 2-6 months depending on who you ask. The purpose is to let the magazines ""rest"" and reclaim some of their springiness.
But it's also common to find people saying that these practices are obsolete with modern handgun springs. Some people claim to have found old loafed magazines from decades ago and fired them with no problem.

From what I know, 1 / distance2 is what determines the intensity of a light source, or gravitational pull, or whatever you're observing. I've heard, many times, by actual physisists, that the simplification is ""Double the distance, divide the intensity by four.""

This is easily put into practice just by using a torch on a wall. If I stand a meter away from a wall, and hold a torch towards it, a part of the wall is lit up. If I stand two meters away from a wall, and hold that same torch towards it, four times the area is being lit up, but it's (roughly) the same amount of photons. By the logic in the above paragraph, that means the same area that was being lit up when I was standing one meter away is only being hit by a quarter of as much light, right?

That all makes sense to me, but when you turn what you're observing into gravity, my brain has a fit.

So, if I double my distance from Earth, I'll divide its gravitational pull on me by four? I'm currently sitting on a chair, with my feet up on my desk, suspended about 60cm from the ground. So, if I run this through a calculator with that equation up the top of this post, I get ~0.00027. Let's times that by Earth's surface gravity (9.8m/s, but because I punched in 60cm, not 0.6m, I'll convert it to 980cm). Interesting. I get 0.2646cm. So...Earth's current gravitational pull on me is 2.6mm/s? But it's not, otherwise I'd be knocking myself out on my roof every time I farted. Hell, if I double my distance, again, so I'm 1.2m away, its gravitational pull should be 0.65mm.

Can you see where my confusion is coming from?

Keep in mind, try to keep any explanations simple for my layman, little mind.

Just a side, but related question, if anyone knows, is there a simple equation I can punch into a calculator that can determine how far away from an object you need to be in order for its gravitational pull on you to be almost 0? I know that it can never be 0, because gravity will always affect you no matter how far away you are, but, for example, I'm working with limited decimal places, like 3. I mean, in the real world, once the gravity is as low as 0.001m/s, and you increase the distance further, it's going to go to 0.00099999999999999--etc, but if I'm working with 3 decimal places, maximum, it will just become 0.000.

Say I make up a fake planet with a random surface gravity off the top of my head. I'll choose 20.9m/s. Is there an equation I can pop into my calculator with ""20.9"" somewhere in it , that will spit out the distance from the planet a fictional rocket would have to be in order for that gravitational pull to be less than 0.001?",,False,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,self,Confusion about the inverse square law.

A few years back I read an article on Graphene and conductivity. It basically stated that it was so conductive that they were having a difficult time finding an interruption switch (they couldn’t turn it off).

We finally have an interruption switch for Graphene:

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/graphene-finally-gets-an-electronic-on-off-switch/

This effectively makes graphene a transistor.

""Semiconductors are defined by their band gap: the energy required to excite an electron stuck in the valence band, where it cannot conduct electricity, to the conduction band, where it can. The band gap needs to be large enough so that there is a clear contrast between a transistor’s on and off states, and so that it can process information without generating errors.”



I also read an article on how MIT was able to create something of a quantum gate, similar to a field effect transistor, but for quantum computing. However, in order for quantum computing to come to fruition we have to have the ability to pass a single photon (and only a single photon) through a gate. http://news.mit.edu/2012/single-photon-transmitter-could-enable-new-quantum-devices-0725

Is is passing through the gate or the drain? (like FET)

What is the definition of a band gap in quantum computing?

When it comes to writing code for quantum computing, I can’t help but think of a shutter on a camera. 

Will we write code that basically opens the shutter to a certain degree (instead of 0’s and 1’s) ? 

Or can we again apply the same principle of the interruption switch and control the amount of light?

I'm a historian doing archaeology, which means I'm doubly out of my element (so to speak). I've been looking at glass beads that were dropped in the outhouse of a New England boarding school sometime in the 1860s. Most of them are simple glass beads, perhaps used for teaching girls crafts, but I've got [one that I can't identify](http://i.imgur.com/EyZe4GO.jpg). It's definitely not glass, but I also doubt it's [jet](http://www.gemstones-guide.com/Jet.html), which was sometimes used for fancier things.

Because it's a historical artifact, any form of destructive analysis is out of the question. I used an X-ray florescence tracer at two different settings, one that excites only [low-Z elements](http://i.imgur.com/f0AseMB.png) (generally those less than Zn) and one that excites [high-Z elements](http://i.imgur.com/A4zmeZd.png) and uses a filter to absorb excess energy and obscure X-rays returning from low-Z elements. For those not in-the-know, X-ray florescence sends X-rays into an object, which excites the electrons; when they settle back down, they produce X-rays of their own depending on how big their home atoms are; the tracer collects these return X-rays and plots how many arrive at each energy level, basically producing a chart of which elements are present in the object.

As you can see, the [low-Z spectrum](http://i.imgur.com/f0AseMB.png) reveals almost no Si, which is the predominant element in glass. It instead spikes at S and Ti, with a number of other trace elements as well. The spike at Rh/Pd is caused by the X-ray tracer itself and can be ignored (although it obscures any Cl that might be present). Note that the tracer also has a hard time picking up elements beneath Al, so I can't assume that C, O, or other light elements are absent.

Regarding the [high-Z spectrum](http://i.imgur.com/A4zmeZd.png), the peaks at Rh and Pd can again be ignored, and the broad peak around 19.0 keV is the Compton peak representing a scattering of the Rh/Pd energy; it's height suggests that this isn't a very dense material, but it doesn't tell us much more. There are small peaks for most elements between Ti and Zr, with taller peaks at Ti and the Sr-Y-Zr combo which suggests (to me) a natural mineral source.

This is all qualitative kind of stuff, and unfortunately, there's no way to translate this data for rigorous quantitative analysis (unless I did destructive analysis on a small sample, which is again out of the question). I did push it through a program called PyMca, which uses fundamental parameters (i.e. a large number of assumptions that never quite match reality), and I almost certainly made errors in using the program. These data should be taken with a high degree of caution. Nevertheless, here's the elements that PyMca calculated having a mass fraction of ≥ 0.5% in each spectrum. Low-Z: Si 1.27%, P 0.50%, S 10.27% (Ti came out surprisingly low). High-Z: Se 2.97% (whereas I would have expected Ti, Sr, and Zr, with possibly Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Hg, Y, and Sn as well). My next step is using PyMca (or some other form of analysis) to produce more believable mass ratio data.

So that's what I've got! Does anyone have thoughts on what this could be, good places to find reference data that I can compare spectra or calculated mass ratios to, or any other constructive ways to use the data on hand? I'm grateful for any ways out of this dead end (but keeping in mind that I have only little access to the artifact and absolutely no access to research funds).

**EDIT.** Thank you for your overwhelming interest and knowledge! I've gotten a lot of great recommendations for future methods of analysis—Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, etc.—but for the moment I'm constrained to what I've got. The general consensus seems to be that the base matrix is probably rubber (organic, comprised of light elements that don't show up with X-ray florescence) hardened or ""vulcanized"" with Sulfur. Charles Goodyear patented this process in 1844, and the hardened rubber, also called [Ebonite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebonite), was soon being sold as a cheap substitute for fancy jet jewelry. This bead could very plausibly be a cheap bit of jewelry, perhaps even a [bolo tie](http://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-3ced9f/products/13190/images/13007/wolfbo9lo__88094.1405131641.1280.1280.jpg?c=2), although I've also gotten a few other interesting suggestions: an early electrical part, a jacket button, or even a piece for a stringed instrument.

The Titanium peak may represent Titanium Dioxide, which can be used to opacify and whiten a material. In this case, that would probably be a white paint or other residue, which may be seen in the [grooves on top](http://i.imgur.com/EyZe4GO.jpg). I suspect that this might come from lead paint that was dumped or otherwise leached into the outhouse on top of the bead. Although surface contaminants didn't substantially affect my assays of glass beads, in this case it may have been different. There was no white residue visibly present where I took my assays, but it may have bonded or otherwise permeated the surface and thus contaminated my results.

With these things in mind, I'd appreciate any further thoughts:

1. Does anything about this summary seem wrong or misstated?

2. High Sulfur points to Ebonite, but can't Jet also have high levels of Sulfur? Is there anything that points to this material *not* being Jet?

3. The other earth metals haven't attracted much attention. Are these plausibly present in Ebonite? Jet? or possible contaminants like white paint?",,False,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,self,What material could produce the X-ray florescence spectra for this historical artifact?,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/574qxs/what_material_could_produce_the_xray_florescence/,,,self,"{'images': [{'id': 'g1xd_rbuSyR0kSyU9R7bBFhMDxyFdEFxdbEPidG_XjU', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/Oo5v6T2CXDrlBp-Gs4t5DwM8bg5etmgfUbD6AivalmY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=0f800ba391e0a32183fc93dab8a43353', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/Oo5v6T2CXDrlBp-Gs4t5DwM8bg5etmgfUbD6AivalmY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=3b879f25666a141c5681db05e0ee792e', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/Oo5v6T2CXDrlBp-Gs4t5DwM8bg5etmgfUbD6AivalmY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=8a4b9c6853083c05c54e4465dc24271b', 'width': 320}, {'height': 480, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/Oo5v6T2CXDrlBp-Gs4t5DwM8bg5etmgfUbD6AivalmY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=23dc8b858f82abb3df6e9b5577b2bd31', 'width': 640}, {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/Oo5v6T2CXDrlBp-Gs4t5DwM8bg5etmgfUbD6AivalmY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=38da3725122feae9b37205607855b7ad', 'width': 960}, {'height': 810, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/Oo5v6T2CXDrlBp-Gs4t5DwM8bg5etmgfUbD6AivalmY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=2836b6d007bcb97e036949fc0e86ef2b', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1704, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/Oo5v6T2CXDrlBp-Gs4t5DwM8bg5etmgfUbD6AivalmY.jpg?s=f3b722ece0b5b51a544e311214726a47', 'width': 2272}, 'variants': {}}]}",1476330644.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,1408230249.0,{},{},,,,

In quantum mechanics you usually bump into infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, but I've always noticed that you can find a basis with cardinality = Aleph_0 (the cardinality of the natural numbers).

What I am testing are the factors which influence the strength of rope and I am doing some shock testing. 

I plan on attaching a weight to the bottom of the rope (with the rope tied to something of course, perhaps a tree) and dropping it from the height intervals.

I was thinking, my rope would probably withstand a drop from 10cm, but definitely not 20 (toilet paper rope BTW). But according the Newton's second law, F=m*a and the acceleration it would be experiencing would be 9.8m/s^2 meaning that the force would remain the same no matter what height it is dropped from.

So in physics, force is measured in Newtons (N) and the metric units of that are KgM/s^2, because it is a measure of force required to accelerate a given mass to a given acceleration

however, lets say I'm standing still and then jump. I will land on the ground with Force (F1). now, say i jump off a tall building and hit the ground with Force (F2). Surely F1 =/= F2 because the force of the second impact would certainly have been able to accelerate a given mass to much greater than acceleration than the first force would have. The reason being is because Velocity is the difference between the two jumps

Since the second person jumped from much higher, he had to to accelerate to terminal velocity, where as the first person only fell from a few meters and didn't pick up much speed.

The reason for the difference in these two impacts is the energy, which is affected by velocity e=1/2Mv^2

Infalling observers are time dilated to an indefinite shear as measured in a sidereal frame of reference. Unlike the infalling observers however, hawking radiation represents mass tunneling out of the black hole on a finite sidereal timescale: particle pairs form *beyond* the horizon (behind committed infalling matter) and one particle escapes completely, thus never shears as acutely as infalling matter does.

Therefore from the IO (infalling observer) frame of reference, hawking radiation must heat up to most likely fatal temperatures as you approach the event horizon and the black hole will evaporate and recede in front of your cooked remains faster than you can fall in. Additionally, the indefinitely high frequency of quantum tunneling in IO's frame of reference means that plenty of IO's mass will also evaporate (along with the rest of the black hole) prior to any official contact with the event horizon.

Another demonstration of this effect is that if two infalling observers (IO1, IO2) fall in via the same trajectory, IO1 can never reach the event horizon from IO2's frame of reference .. *but IO2 can never catch up to IO1 in their own frame of reference either*. These two facts combined should represent proof that IO2 can never reach the event horizon in their own frame of reference.

I am seriously interested to know, for many reasons, how much it would cost to build a larger and more effective ground based optical telescope then those we currently have at our disposal. 


This telescopes primary instrument(s) would need to have the capability to observe across the electromagnetic spectrum in at least two or three spectra if possible. IF seeing more than 2 or 3 spectra from a single optical telescope is possible please include how it would be possible and what would be needed. Additional instruments would be required of course. I'm not interested in simply making a bigger telescope. 


**My Interests?:** I am interested in innovation. The next frontier in cosmic observation. I'm not interested in a telescope that it's only driven factor is being bigger by a half a meter or similar.

When looking at any available EV that I know of (leaf, tesla, bmw i3, etc) none of them have any kind of gear system for higher speeds.

I drive a 2013 Nissan Altima for example and its most efficient speed seems to be between 65-70 mph (with a CVT transmission). A tesla's most efficient speed is around 45 mph. Why wouldn't giving it a second gear around 45 mph make it more efficient at a higher speed?

The only thing I can think of is that electric motors have very little friction to make higher RPMs worse and that as you increase the RPMs on an ICE engine you get a proportional increase in piston firings, burning more fuel. Is there anything else to it? Why wouldn't giving a tesla a second gear more mileage at higher speeds? Do electric cars lose mileage at higher speeds mostly from greater wind resistance? 

I'm asking because range for EVs is one of the biggest problems right now, and if a tesla model S gets 465 miles to a charge at 45 mph, wouldn't a second gear drastically increase the 265 mile range at 70mph?

Dr. Carroll has talked about the core theory on his blog in the past, and one of the comments on [this post from 2013](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/01/04/the-world-of-everyday-experience-in-one-equation), theoretical pharmacist [Marko Vojinović](http://www.markovojinovic.com/professional/index.html) says:

&gt;Sean, are you trying to be provocative on purpose? 🙂
&gt;
&gt;Leaving aside all the philosophical stuff about consciousness, God, etc., the gravitational sector of that equation is all but understood. Care to give a definition for the path-integral measure [Dg]? Do you sum over all possible spacetime topologies or not? What about the divergent loop-corrections for gravitons? And no, one can’t even get the classical limit (i.e. general relativity) from the above equation.
&gt;
&gt;So not even everyday life, sorry.
&gt;
&gt;There are also some missing pieces in the matter sector, like the proton mass prediction, etc. But those are probably just technical points.
&gt;
&gt;Best, 🙂

There are no follow up comments from Dr. Carroll, or anyone else. So is this guy talking out of his ass, or is the equation for ""the world of everyday experience"" really incomplete?

A photon goes through one(or both) of two slits(A and B). Behind each slit there's a Glan-Thompson Prism that generates two identical entangled photons from one photon. One of them passes through a lens and is detected by Detector D0. The other one, depending on whether it passed through slit A or slit B, is sent to Beam Splitter 1 or 2. Each beam splitter has a 50% chance of ending up in a detector(D1 and D2) or a quantum eraser. The quantum eraser collects photons from both Beam Splitter 1 and 2, preventing anyone from knowing from which detector(and so which slit) the photon came from. The quantum eraser then sends the photon to Detector D3.

Kim *et al.* proved that detectors D0 and D3 don't collapse the wave function of the superposition (|slit A&gt; + |slit B), so after sending a sufficient amount of time interference patterns can be osserved on detector D0). D1 and D2, however, collapse the wave function, so D0 doesn't detect any interference pattern. This is true even if D1, D2 and D3 are light years away from D0.

Let's say instead that I built a particular device containing D1, D2, D3 and the Beam Splitters and sent it to Proxima Centauri(distance from the Sun = 4.24 light years), where my friend John is currently living.

A certain amount of photons go through A or B(or both) and then are duplicated: one goes to D0 in my backyard, one to Proxima Centauri.

Meanwhile my friend John flips a coin and if it is head, he replaces the beam splitters with two mirrors pointed towards their corresponding detectors, if it is tail, he replaces them with two mirrors pointed towards the quantum eraser.

If John flipped tail, after a few seconds D0 will detect interference patterns. If John flipped head, it won't.

Didn't I just receive information 4.24 times faster than *c*?

Alternative version if you don't like FTL theories: the photons enter the LHC and 4.24 years later they are directed towards the device.

Referencing sections 5.1 and 5.2 of [""Modeling Materials"" by Tadmor and Miller:](https://www.amazon.com/Modeling-Materials-Continuum-Multiscale-Techniques/dp/0521856981)

I understand their derivation in 5.1: using the Born-Oppenheimer approximations you can derive a time-dependent Schrodinger equation for the nuclear wave functions which has no explicit dependence on the electrons -- only on nuclear positions *and* the determination that ***if*** you can treat the nuclei as classical particles that this function becomes the classical interatomic model.

I also understand the usage of the *de Broglie thermal wavelength* as a justification for treating atoms as classical particles, not as quantum mechanical ones.

In essence, this justification says that *""if the wavelength is much smaller than the average interatomic spacing then the waves are spatially localized and the atoms can be treated as classical particles.""*  If the wavelength is *""on the order of (or greater than) the interatomic distances, then the wave-like behavior of the atoms is relevant.""*

**My concern / question regards the treatment of Hydrogen atoms.**

They present a case for aluminum and show that the temperature at which the *de Broglie* wavelength is equal to the interatomic spacing is ~1.34 K -- the treatment of aluminum as a classical particle at even just a few Kelvin is valid.

I'm interested in CH3 (methyl groups).  To do the same exercise as above, I want to see if the assumption is valid for Carbon:

    hbar = 1.0545718e-34; % m^2 kg /s
    k = 1.38064852e-23;   % J / K
    amu2kg = 1.66054e-27;

    r = 1.09;  % C-H bond length in Angstroms
    A2K = 1e-10;
    m = 12.0107; % amu 

    T = (2*pi*hbar^2) / ((m * amu2kg) * k * (r*A2K)^2)
 
T = 21.36 Kelvin -- This is a *valid* assumption for carbon, even in really cold CH3 molecules.  However, when I do this for the Hydrogen (use m = 1.008; ) then I find the minimum temperature to be ~255 Kelvin.  So I guess I have several questions:

**Q1**:  Did I do the math right? 

**Q2**:  If yes, does this mean that the assumptions in MD aren't valid for ""warm"" temperatures (~-20 C)

**Q3**:  How valid would trends at/below this temperature be?

**Q4**:  Is there a better justification I should be applying?

For instance, if we have two particles A and B moving at each other at 10m/s, you can say:

- An observer on A will perceive particle B as moving at 10m/s while particle A itself is stationary.
- An observer on B will perceive the opposite: A is moving at 10m/s while B is stationary.
- An external observer on a particle C between A and B might perceive both A and B as moving at 5m/s each.

Again, as I understand it, we don't have a fixed point of reference, we can pick any arbitrary point and have different results. And that's all fine and dandy, until we get to other properties besides speed itself.

Let's say particle A releases a particle B, and particle B is moving away at the speed of light. If we follow the logic above, we could also say that, from the point of view of B, A is the one moving away at the speed of light. However, when a particle moves at the speed of light, it acquires different properties:

- Particle A will experience time as moving at a certain rate, while particle B will experience time as not passing at all.

- If particle B has mass, that mass will be converted to energy. The same won't happen to particle A.

These properties can't be reversed, regardless of the point of reference. You can think of it as a photon released from the Sun - the photon moves at the speed of light, with all the mess that happens because of that, but you can't say the Sun also moves at the speed of light from the photon because that would cause it to change its properties.

I'm using the speed of light as an example, but any speed will actually cause the properties of a body/particle to change. So, my question is: how can we say one particle has a certain speed and the other has another? Is there a fixed, absolute point of reference we can use to measure that? If not, and if speed can only be measured by relative points of reference, how can the properties of the moving particles change in different ways?

------

Edit after the first replies:

Ok, I used 10m/s and the speed of light as extreme examples, but we don't need to use a photon specifically. Let me amp the speeds on the example here.

Note: I know c is technically a constant and not a speed measurement, but I'll use c here as short for ""speed of light in a vacuum.

The effects of relativity, as I learned it, work in a continuum. Everything that moves suffers these effects, but when we talk about day to day speeds, the effects are too slow and can be discarded. However, the faster something moves, the slower it experiences time and the more its mass gets turned to energy, with c as a limit.

Now imagine two particles: A travels at 1/3c, B at 1/4c. Both are fast enough to experience relativistic effects. However, how much of these effects will they experience? From the point of view of B, A travels only at 1/12c, which would be a much smaller effect. Again, from the point of view of B, B doesn't move at all itself. Are they really traveling at 1/3c and 1/4c based on a fixed point, and suffering those effects? Even if these numbers are low, you can think of examples at 80%c and 81%c. Reaching 1c isn't really a requirement for special relativity.

The question then would be - how can we tell something moves at 1/4c or 80%c or any other speed, even relativistic ones, without a frame of reference?",,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,self,"How can we say something travels ""at the speed of light"" (or at any certain speed)?",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4tkz6k/how_can_we_say_something_travels_at_the_speed_of/,,,,,1468975863.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,1410906626.0,{},{},,,,

The difference in actual velocity between 99.9c and 99.99c is very small (~0.1%), but my understanding of relativity is that time dilation effects would slow time down on board the ship relative to the rest of the universe.

Could the time dilation make it appear as if you were moving faster than c compared to the rest of the universe?

In the thought experiment in which you send your older brother on a near-lightspeed journey so that he comes back to Earth the same age as you, let's say he's observed 2 months passing while you've observed 2 years. In that time, the spaceship travelled almost 2 lightyears, so on board it would look like you travelled 2 light years in 2 months, right?

Another way: if you add energy to a system so that it accelerates at 10 m/s^2, as it approaches c its acceleration to an outside observer would seem to decrease (or else it would eventually surpass c). On board the ship, would it always appear as if you were accelerating at 10m/s^2, assuming the energy input remains constant?

Though that sometimes the redness at violet spectral colors is attributed to [this absorption graph](http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/IMG/conesens1.gif) (considering the trichromacy theory), most of the scientific literature states that [this is the most proper cone responses on a living human](http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/IMG/conesens4.gif), and that the redness in the violet spectral colors is attributed to the S cone having a [positive weighted value on the r/g opponency](http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/IMG/oppwgts.gif) (note: this weights are already compensating the difference on the population of the cones). 

So, summarizing, the violet colors at the end of the spectrum cause the most *distinct* response from the S cone, and the spectral unique blue actually happens when you have enough M response to put the r/g at the white (zero) point.

Why am i explaining this? Cause the RGB and CMY system (theoretically) aim for the spectral areas where each cone respond more *distinctly* (and not where the spectral unique hues happen, even though two of them sits close to two of the unique hues).

There's a simple explanation for why the RGB systems use blue instead of violet: Energy economy. Violet has low luminance, so, instead, they use a mix of spectral blue and spectral red to reproduce the purple colors (both spectral and non-spectral ones). You lose gamut, but gain energy efficiency.

But, why don't the CMY systems use a green-yellow pigment with a peak absorbance at the violet spectrum, if this should be the best choice for a wider gamut?",,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,self,Why does the CMY systems uses yellow instead of a green-yellow pigment?,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4pp5fr/why_does_the_cmy_systems_uses_yellow_instead_of_a/,,,self,"{'images': [{'id': 'SdDYogWeinMjyLfPvISbfF-Ovs_R68yLKcMBZYE9Lzc', 'resolutions': [{'height': 105, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/WowiifuEnpvqxCPfEASzY0Qs-oVwlVdjunKvHcn4ycM.gif?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=bc788b1be034cdc0a233d4f2b0e8e890', 'width': 108}, {'height': 211, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/WowiifuEnpvqxCPfEASzY0Qs-oVwlVdjunKvHcn4ycM.gif?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=70cd7efb9f1934cfa3bcf97cc52223df', 'width': 216}, {'height': 313, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/WowiifuEnpvqxCPfEASzY0Qs-oVwlVdjunKvHcn4ycM.gif?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=3dfe918c6d7d0968e643509b68de6333', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 362, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/WowiifuEnpvqxCPfEASzY0Qs-oVwlVdjunKvHcn4ycM.gif?fm=jpg&amp;s=5dece5e4f752750b323534a29935fac2', 'width': 369}, 'variants': {'gif': {'resolutions': [{'height': 105, 'url': 'https://g.redditmedia.com/WowiifuEnpvqxCPfEASzY0Qs-oVwlVdjunKvHcn4ycM.gif?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=d9906b17e5ab7cc03e8dd7813f182400', 'width': 108}, {'height': 211, 'url': 'https://g.redditmedia.com/WowiifuEnpvqxCPfEASzY0Qs-oVwlVdjunKvHcn4ycM.gif?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=9584b85fc755f2fac40d4ff39817c6aa', 'width': 216}, {'height': 313, 'url': 'https://g.redditmedia.com/WowiifuEnpvqxCPfEASzY0Qs-oVwlVdjunKvHcn4ycM.gif?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=d725855dd21aa0a5b68b2f95e79f2d72', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 362, 'url': 'https://g.redditmedia.com/WowiifuEnpvqxCPfEASzY0Qs-oVwlVdjunKvHcn4ycM.gif?s=7238092a02f5617c4bd3e8e014982cc1', 'width': 369}}, 'mp4': {'resolutions': [{'height': 105, 'url': 'https://g.redditmedia.com/WowiifuEnpvqxCPfEASzY0Qs-oVwlVdjunKvHcn4ycM.gif?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;fm=mp4&amp;mp4-fragmented=false&amp;s=f496554ce12fec20aa0aa0cd76956230', 'width': 108}, {'height': 211, 'url': 'https://g.redditmedia.com/WowiifuEnpvqxCPfEASzY0Qs-oVwlVdjunKvHcn4ycM.gif?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;fm=mp4&amp;mp4-fragmented=false&amp;s=c4cb31f61601c6d4ef7514c976a1bc5a', 'width': 216}, {'height': 313, 'url': 'https://g.redditmedia.com/WowiifuEnpvqxCPfEASzY0Qs-oVwlVdjunKvHcn4ycM.gif?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;fm=mp4&amp;mp4-fragmented=false&amp;s=49bc05b9da94d68254396902f5c3280e', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 362, 'url': 'https://g.redditmedia.com/WowiifuEnpvqxCPfEASzY0Qs-oVwlVdjunKvHcn4ycM.gif?fm=mp4&amp;mp4-fragmented=false&amp;s=b6e469720de9cfc74f2d66d4293744a2', 'width': 369}}}}]}",1466802411.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,1465197940.0,{},{},,,,

Strange question.  But I was watching a neighbor pass by my house on a skateboard today, and I started wondering about the physics of it.  Obviously, he was moving between points A and B on his journey faster than he would be walking.  But then again, he also has to occasionally use one foot to push against the ground several times to keep the momentum of the skateboard moving forward at a higher speed than if he was just walking.

My question is basically is he ending up expending the SAME amount of total energy by the ""pushing"" of his one foot while using the skateboard as he would if he was just walking the same distance traveled using two feet?  

Assume all other things are equal, as in the ground being level in the comparison, etc.

My intuition says there is no such thing as a ""free energy lunch"".  That regardless of how he propels his body between two points, he would have to expend the same amount of energy regardless whether he was walking or occasionally pushing the skateboard with one foot.  But I'm not sure about that right now.  Are there any other factors involved that would change the energy requirement expended? Like the time vs distance traveled in each case? 

EDIT:  I flaired the question as Physics, but it might be an Engineering question instead.

EDIT 2:  Wow.  I never expected my question to generate so many answers.  Thanks for that.  I do see now that my use of the words ""energy expended"" should probably have been ""work done"" instead.

The answers (other than: “that’s just how it is”) fall into two categories:
    
1) It’s completely random, but convenient because it makes is easy to tell events which can no cause each other (“space-like separation”) from ones that can (“time-like separation”) by the sign of the answer. (Which is nice, but seems hardly a big deal)     
2) Because it’s consistent with reality by making the spacetime interval (S^2) be invariable in all inertial frames.
 
First of all, the two answers seems to be mutually exclusive.     
Second, answer #2 is not much of an answer unless you explain HOW it’s consistent with reality whereas having same sign would not be. It seems to me that one can use a coordinate system with all same-signs for time and space that also has the spacetime interval be invariant.

If we were to draw an X &amp; T two dimensional chart where both axes have positive values, then a shifting of frames would rotate simply rotate both axes by same degree keeping them 90deg to each other instead of moving them toward each other.

[Frameshift image](http://s33.postimg.org/pd34s0f7z/frameshift.gif)

Looking at using good-old Pythagoras theorem, one would write X^2 + (CT)^2 = S^2 But X’^2 + (CT’)^2 also equals S^2.

I.e. - X’^2 + (CT’)^2 = X^2 + (CT)^2 = S^2 Meaning S^2 is still showing to be invariable and without the use of any minus signs. So why add all the awkwardness of negative CT?

Now I know that you can't expell the mass at or beyond the speed of light but even then you can still add and ever increasing amount of energy and therefore momentum giving you greater thrust. 

Is this possible or is there some physical reason of why it can't happen,  I'm speaking from a purely hypothetical standpoint and using technology in the distant future, maybe using super conducting magnets or something.

There is this medicine that is used to ""improve"" the immune system. I was reading an article about it, and it said what I mentioned in the title, and I was wondering if that meant the drug could also potentially prevents Candida Albicans (Thrush infections) in people. 

This is the excerpt that is interesting: 

""(DCs = Dendritic Cells) IF-S inhibits C. albicans and A. fumigatus binding to human DCs.Given the origin of the polysaccharide moiety of AM3 (IF-S), we initially set up an experiment to analyze whether IF-S could affect the capture of pathogenic strains of Candida by DCs. IF-S inhibited the binding of C. albicans to human MDDCs in a dose-dependent manner and to a similar extent as a function-blocking anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1A and C). Furthermore, IF-S also diminished the number of fungi bound per cell, as evidenced by the reduction of the mean fluorescence intensity of the cell population (Fig. 1B). Besides, IF-S reduced the binding of A. fumigatus conidia to human MDDCs in a dose-dependent manner, and the degree of inhibition was comparable to that obtained with equivalent concentrations of S. cerevisiae mannan or with a blocking antibody against DC-SIGN antibody (Fig. 1D). Therefore, the polysaccharide component of AM3 inhibits the DC-SIGN-dependent binding of C. albicans and A. fumigatus to MDDCs.""

http://aac.asm.org/content/51/7/2313.full

So to conclude, does this mean the use of this drug (AM3 - IF-S) could prevent/help get rid of Candida Albicans infections causing Thrush? 

If C. Albicans is intracellular, then this medicine would help prevent it, but if it isn't, then it looks like the medicine would actually HELP the C. Albicans fungus. (I am a complete noob this is noob reasoning). Does candida attack the DCs or does it just attack the skin cells?

On April 13th, however, we detected an M6.9 quake in [Burma](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20005hqz#general).  If I'm doing the math right, that's like 116° away from my location in eastern Pennsylvania, USA.  Yet, our [plot](http://www.kjmagnetics.com/images/blog/4_13_2016.png) clearly shows a squiggle at exactly the time you'd guess P-waves would arrive here.  That's around 14:15Z.  Ignore the noise hours earlier from a nearby heating system.

It's not just me.  When I look at the data for other seismometers here in PA, they see it as well.

&gt;If we plug c (speed of light) in as Vesc, G = 6.67408 × 10-11 m3 kg-1 s-2, and M = 5.972 × 1024 kg, we can solve for R.

I’m Jeff Galvin, son of an MIT Electrical Engineer and inventor who pioneered advanced portable radar and analog signal processing. I’m an entrepreneur, Silicon Valley startup guy and former Apple International Product Marketing Manager in the 80’s; where I traveled the world introducing the original Macintosh (and LISA if you ever heard of that). Computer nerd from the 7th grade (early 1970’s), I taught basic computer programming on weekends at MIT and later became the youngest-ever Head Teaching Fellow for Natural Sciences 110 (the second largest undergraduate class on campus) at Harvard as a Sophomore. After a successful career in computers, software and the Internet, I retired to become a “Silicon Valley Angel Investor”. Retirement didn’t last long… I met Dr. Roscoe Brady at the National Institutes of Health and he showed me something that I immediately realized would be bigger than computers or the Internet ever became. In 2006, Dr. Brady opened my eyes to viral vectors and genetic technologies that I realized could let me reprogram the fundamental computers of life itself: the human cell. That “ah-ha moment” back in 2006 began my quest to solve intractable human disease by repairing the underlying genetic roots of cancers, inherited disorders and infectious disease. Now, I head a leading genetic technologies company that is going to help send chemotherapy and radiation for cancer the way of leeches and bloodletting, and provide treatments and cures for scores of formally un-addressable disorders and diseases.

TL;DR - Silicon Valley sweetheart turned genetic drug developer


The Activator - My name is David Pauza, an OG (original gene cloner) since the 1970s. My areas of expertise are human virology and cancer. For the last 30 years or so, I have been studying HIV / AIDS, publishing scientific papers and educating the public about viral diseases. Before joining AGT, I had started an HIV research program at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, then built a strong HIV program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and finally moved to the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. During those years my lab group focused on understanding the most basic steps in HIV disease and designing new treatments or vaccines. We first talked openly of curing HIV disease in 1992 and have kept that flame burning ever since. The path to a cure depended on studying fundamental aspects of human virology and immunology. Many of the lessons learned in our study of AIDS apply directly to human cancer, which continues to be a major threat to HIV+ people even with current therapy. I brought these perspectives, skills and some team members to American Gene Technologies where we are working with Jeff to chart innovative cures for major human diseases.


TL;DR - A scientist with deep knowledge and a big bag of tricks.


As we see it, the new frontier of drug development is genetic science, where rifle-shot treatments deal with the specific, underlying causes of disease, eventually leading to cures rather than lifetime treatments. We take a creative approach, believing that many diseases can be treated with genetic therapy if you mix the right technology with a solid understanding of disease and add advice from talented clinicians to guide treatment delivery.

The macroscopic view shows a [blurry 'cloud'](https://imgur.com/Fso58CY) not visually unlike an electron density cloud.

Not just that, but an electron density cloud is often described as probabilistic, with the position being otherwise unknowable. Similarly, the position of the quarter can be expressed in probabilistic terms: the quarter has, at any given moment, an equal probability of making any angle θ with respect to a coordinate plane orthagonal to the spin axis. Without knowledge of underlying patterns, that is the best approximation possible.

Yet, with classical physics, the 'cloud' may be analytically deconstructed to determine the path or position of the quarter. All that is required is known data, in this case, the velocity, mass distribution, size, etc. These form conditional probabilities that make for a predictable path, thus expressible in terms of equations (eg. the probability that the angle 1 second from now is π radians is 100% given that the current angle is 0, angular velocity is π rads/s, angular acceleration is 0, etc; θ' = θ+w*t+(1/2)αt^2

I am most likely thinking about something the wrong way, making the wrong assumptions, or am just generally uninformed about the topic, as it is not my area. But let me try to ask it in the clearest way possible (which admittedly might not be all that clear), and hopefully someone more versed on the topic can answer this for me.

**Background**

* I was watching Richard Feynman's lectures on quantum physics some time ago where he explained the probability of light traveling in a certain direction. To paraphrase [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUj2ZRUa7c) lecture. Light has the probability to travel in any direction, however it has the highest probability to travel along the shortest path in space. Ex light will reflect off of a mirror in a straight line because this is the most probable outcome, due to it being the shortest path the light can travel.

* Relating this to Relativity, I made the assumption that the gravitational lensing of light moving around a massive object, like a black hole is due to the fact that the massive object will bend space, creating a new ""shortest path"" for light to travel on, rather than the light just moving ""straight"" into the object. Which in turn allows us to view stars, etc. ""behind"" massive objects.

**Specific Theoretical Situation In Question**

In general, I am thinking of a theoretical case where there is some immensely massive object that can bend the light from another object directly behind it. I.E. i am thinking of a star that is directly behind, say a blackhole, or galaxy, other more massive object relative to our line of sight. (Though I know we haven't been able to observe gravitational lensing with black holes)

Let's say we have some huge spherical gravitational anomaly such that, for a star directly behind it, in a straight line with our viewpoint: (1) The anomaly physically blocks the object completely (if gravitational lensing is ignored) (2) The star behind the object is completely visible to us with gravitational lensing (i.e. all the light from the star travels around the anomaly to make it visible, [which I am not sure is physically possible]), such that the light from the ""left"" side of the star travels around the ""left"" side of the object, following the shortest path in space [I am also not sure this is how it works], same with the ""right"" side and ""top"", etc.

**Question(s)**

* If this is an allowable case in physics, what would happen to a photon created directly in the center of the star that travels directly towards the center of the gravitational anomaly? 

* Do we as observers see this photon? If we do, how does the photon travel to us, assuming it takes the shortest path [if it does]? Is there some ""default"" shortest path in space the photon takes? Or is the path governed purely by probability, meaning it can take any path around the sphere?

* Does it ""hit"" the gravitational anomaly and is thus ""blocked"" from our view?


Hopefully this made some sense. Something seems off about this situation, and I have a feeling that it has to do with the assumption I made about how gravitational lensing works, or if it is possible to see an object directly behind another if there is enough gravity, or something along those lines. 

If someone could set me straight on the issue, I would really appreciate it. Sorry for such a wordy question.

1.  First off, is this actually what happens or is it perhaps an optical illusion caused by the motion of the rocket relative to the camera, and the huge telephoto lens it's surely using?

And if it is true that it increases the chance of implantation failing, what percentage does it increase to?

Let's assume you have an object that is moving through space extremely fast. Let's say it is a rocket traveling at a constant velocity of 0.999999C. This rocket emits a laser. The theory of special relativity states that light is always observed to be traveling at C (3e8 m/s) in every inertial frame of reference.

Say we tracked the positions of the rocket and the laser beam in two different frames of reference: that of the rocket, and a 'stationary' frame. From the 'stationary' frame of reference, an observer will see the positions of both the rocket and the laser beam staying very close together, diverging at a rate of (1-0.999999)C. After a period of time, t, the distance between the rocket and the furthest point of the laser beam will be (1-0.999999)Ct. However, from the frame of reference of the rocket, special relativity states that the laser will be observed at speed C at all times, so if we again track the positions of both the rocket and laser, they will be diverging at a rate of C, and the distance between them at a time t will be Ct.

As you're scraping the sides, you notice you can tilt your spoon in such a way that the edge matches the curvature of the truncated cone (that might be a made up term, correct me if I'm wrong). With this match, you can cleanly scrape all the yogurt [in a pass of a certain thickness] off the sides of the cup. 

So my question: Is this always the case? Can every spoon match every yogurt cup at some angle? 

Also, does this have anything to do with parabolas being conic sections?

I may have just learned the wrong thing early on and never looked back.  Here's how I understand greenhouse gases.  Let's think about combustion in its simplest form: coal combustion.  C (s) + O2 (g) -&gt; CO2 (g).  The gas we started with was O2, and we exchanged one O2 mole for one CO2 mole.  I always just assumed that CO2 must have a lower heat capacity than O2.  Therefore, when the sun's (relatively constant) energy hits a mole of CO2, it is able to warm it up more than it would be able to warm up the mole of O2 that existed before.  Hence, the temperature rises.  After looking at a heat capacity table, a mole of CO2 has a higher heat capacity than a mole of O2, so this turns my whole understanding upside down.

Since we have such a good variety of experts then maybe someone already knows what I need.

Suppose you have a droplet of water or other aerosol, if unperturbed it should sit as a sphere with the pressure and surface tension in balance. If it is then perturbed it will oscillate I assume in shapes according to spherical harmonics.

I know that if you have a charged droplet (e.g. Millikans oil drops) then you can [force these oscillations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamic_droplet_deformation) by the application of an alternating electric field. 

However, if no driving force is present do they still oscillate? As in imagine you sprayed some perfume and as it hangs in the air are the droplets oscillating or still?

In terms of a single droplet, if they do oscillate then at what frequency do they oscillate? Is there a preferred mode(s) from an arbitrary perturbation (in terms of power spectrum)? Does that mode have a set frequency?

Lastly, what are the typical amplitudes of any oscillations? I assume there must be a limit where the droplet would become droplets but are they deforming in terms of radius by 1% 10% 100%?

Any help (or useful discussion) would be greatly appreciated!

Let's say we want to find out how much force (in Newtons) is being applied on a car. If a car has a Mass of 600kg and an Acceleration of 20m/s/s then we can work out the Force pushing the car by multiplying the Mass by the Acceleration like this 600 x 20 = 12000N

Right?

But then what if we use pounds instead of kilograms? 600 kilograms=1322.77 pounds.

But the equation F=ma doesn't pre-define it's terms/values. And thus we get 1322.77x20=26455.4N

To be more specific - let's imagine there's nothing in space - just Earth and Sun, they are both locked in their positions so that the same side of the Sun is always facing Earth and the same side of Earth is always facing Sun. We are an observer looking at it all from the top. We consider two cases -in both we start with the current distance between Earth and Sun. In the first case the Earth is orbiting Sun - period=1 year. The observer on the top is also rotating once a year - so everything seems stationary to him (there is no way of saying that it's not).

&amp;nbsp;

Drift Velocity - Electrons don't really travel at the speed of light. But wires have a lot of electrons in them. So when we turn the light on, a kind of domino effect is created, where one electron bumps into another, and this happens pretty instantaneously and that's how electricity flows. Individually they're pretty slow, but due to the domino effect, current flows at a pretty rapid rate. And the amount of current is high because the number of electrons per unit volume is very high ( 10^(21) electrons/m^3 or something).And if I remember correctly, the value is something like 10^(-5) m/s or something.

Now I calculated the factor that space expands at every second by expressing 1 Mpc == 3.1 * 10^-19 km

FAQ:

&gt; Where do they come from?

The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). 

&gt; How fast do they go?

Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)).

&gt; Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?

The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16).

In 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.

&gt; Does this mean we can control gravity?

No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html).

&gt; What's the practical application?

[Here](http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.

&gt; How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)

There is a bar magnet with its N pole facing a wheel, and on top of the wheel, there is another bar magnet firmly attached to it. On the right half of the wheel, the N pole is always closer to the bar magnet above, and is thus repelled, causing a clockwise rotation of the wheel. As the wheel rotates round and the magnet on the wheel reaches the left half, the S pole is closer and is thus attracted. This reinforces the clockwise rotation of the wheel. 

In both cases, it seems that the wheel is constantly being accelerated clockwise resulting in perpetual motion. What am I missing here?

A bonus question (if anyone is nice enough to answer this as well): Does this system have an equilibrium state (unstable or stable)? That is, is there any position I can place the magnet and the wheel such that there is no motion.

In the process, I came across [this NYT article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/business/misgivings-about-how-a-weed-killer-affects-the-soil.html) from 2013 about the detrimental effects of glyphosate on soil (and yes, I know that GMO != glyphosate), which draws its empirical evidence largely entirely from Robert Kremer's work on glyphosate.

His paper [*Glyphosate and glyphosate-resistant crop interactions with
rhizosphere microorganisms*](http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/35795/PDF) seems to capture the substance of his work well:

&gt; Current crop production relies heavily on transgenic, glyphosate-resistant (GR) cultivars. Widespread cultivation of transgenic crops has received considerable attention. Impacts of glyphosate on rhizosphere microorganisms and activities are reviewed based on published and new data from long-term field projects documenting effects of glyphosate applied to GR soybean and maize. Field studies conducted in Missouri, U.S.A. during 1997–2007 assessed effects of glyphosate applied to GR soybean and maize on root colonization and soil populations of *Fusarium* and selected rhizosphere bacteria. Frequency of root-colonizing *Fusarium* increased significantly after glyphosate application during growing seasons in each year at all sites. Roots of GR soybean and maize treated with glyphosate were heavily colonized by *Fusarium* compared to non-GR or GR cultivars not treated with glyphosate. Microbial groups and functions affected by glyphosate included Mn transformation and plant availability; phytopathogen–antagonistic bacterial interactions; and reduction in nodulation. Root-exuded glyphosate may serve as a nutrient source for fungi and stimulate propagule germination. The specific microbial indicator groups and processes were sensitive to impacts of GR crops and are part of an evolving framework in developing polyphasic microbial analyses for complete assessment of GR technology that is more reliable than single techniques or general microbial assays. 

Wikipedia seems to describe [*Fusarium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusarium) as a benign, commonplace fungus (and of course, too much of something can still be a bad thing; also, it was a strain of *Fusarium* that almost wiped out bananas in the 1800's, if I'm not mistaken), and the paper's introduction notes increased susceptibility to *Phytophtora*, which Wikipedia tells me is significantly more dangerous, but honestly, if I've learned anything during my time at university so far, it's that if I have to Wikipedia stuff even just once while reading a paper, then I don't know enough to fully understand it. Moreover, I couldn't really find anything *responding* to Kremer's work (the USDA work referenced in the NYT article sort of sidesteps the issue - understandable given the sizeable literature).

Hence my question: how significant are these findings, really? Is glyphosate actually as threatening of an ecological risk as Kremer [make it out to be](http://www.ipni.net/ppiweb/pbrazil.nsf/1c678d0ba742019483256e19004af5b8/66b18e2a70f87a180325738c0050a0b2/$FILE/Anais%20Robert%20Kremer.pdf), and how much actual support does his work offer to [anti-GMO activists](http://foodintegritynow.org/2015/04/15/dr-robert-kremer-gmos-glyphosate-and-soil-biology/)?",,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,self,Effects of glyphosate on rhizosphere?,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3ulee1/effects_of_glyphosate_on_rhizosphere/,,,self,"{'images': [{'id': 'v45ErN0GViFh2cWhr6YdW0tK_nje-9BAZbOyQd4ODto', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/d1JIOGiMqRLLnEEUUhbRotSRyjFr19aEtRC5AXbK8EY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=5df8811510b78f21d797d83d2d1d93ac', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/d1JIOGiMqRLLnEEUUhbRotSRyjFr19aEtRC5AXbK8EY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=fd01762a0ea85ef5be8783827c56ad97', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/d1JIOGiMqRLLnEEUUhbRotSRyjFr19aEtRC5AXbK8EY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=d0829baaaa952d5794b720908c1f900c', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 338, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/d1JIOGiMqRLLnEEUUhbRotSRyjFr19aEtRC5AXbK8EY.jpg?s=35a4a6b9d753a65767fed9f5ced4dc70', 'width': 600}, 'variants': {}}]}",1448725946.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,1418243505.0,{},{},,,,

I'm preparing for my finals papers and it's holidays already so I can't turn to the library for help. Through my course, we have discussed Chinese religions, and how their believers interpret, practice, and utilize their beliefs. But we never addressed the most basic, basic - almost non-important - question of how scholars define religions. 

Why that would be an interesting question to delve into is because, Eastern and Westerns religions are so fundamentally different that if the same definitions are applied to examine them, the results can be very, very misleading. But at the same time, lay people are basically unaware of this; ""Are you religious?"" is essentially an impossible question to answer for traditional Taiwanese/Chinese. (At least personally speaking; I am ethically Taiwanese but was born in the States, and attended an Americanized international school in Taiwan for middle and high school - so culture-wise I'm very much 50-50 American and Taiwanese.)

So I would imagine common definition of religion coming from an Abrahamic point of view would be: Does one believe in a supreme being(s)? Does the religion impose a distinct way of life (going to church on Sundays, praying - as to separately define religiosity and non-religiosity)? Is there scripture?

But those definitions would never work for Chinese religions because, first, Chinese religions can be said to be agnostic in nature. The questions of creation and supremacy of Gods are non-essential. That's why there is [secular Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_Buddhism) and people considering [Taoism as atheist](http://atheistexperience.blogspot.com/2007/09/taoism.html). Moreover, Chinese religions do not really require a different way of life; you can eat meat and be a Buddhist. Buddhism basically operates on believing in karma, which is a concept believed beyond religions. Taoism describes a way to becoming peaceful inside. So, people do seemingly Buddhist and Taoist stuff already, whether they specifically follow them or not. 

**So I want to know if any expert can provide me with how the academics approach defining Chinese religions. Or, if you can provide me with evidence (academically studied or not) of trying to define or interpret Chinese (Eastern) religions with Abrahamic definitions.** The closest I have is my personal experience of how when I came to college some people asked me if I am religious and it took me a while to provide a well-rounded answer. Most Taiwanese are the same with me: Do we actually believe in the supernatural, with Gods and hell and ghosts? No, since there's no scientific evidence. But do we sometimes go to temples? Sure, why not, it takes like, 5 minutes. We do it ""just in case"" the prior is real. So, I'm wondering if there is any more recorded evidence which I can use to supplement my paper.

So, a magnet [S|N] on the left of a point of reference if the point of reference is surrounded by a spherical shell of thick ferromagnetical material (mu-metal or just iron), should have most of the magnetic lines that would have gone through the point of reference instead go through the shell. 

However, I don't get why this would happen on am more mechanical viewpoint. 
I imagine (possibly incorrectly of course) that any ferromagnetic material essentially acts like a lattice of relatively randomly arranged microscopic magnets...where these magnets could be the atoms or molecules themselves. We call these 'domains', and they have North and South ends like a any other magnet.
So I next imagine that a shell of this stuff places in a magnetic field would result in these domains, which are otherwise fixes in 3 dimensions, to rotate (losing some energy due to molecular friction or whatever..resulting in heat) to arrange themselves with the magnetic field lines. 
So now I imagine that some arrangement of little magnets around a point of reference would negate whatever field is at that point of reference without the shell.

I tried to draw this, and get a situation where if everything is in one line and nicely shaped, then the top part of the shell would be a magnetic mirror image of the bottom (if we are looking at just 2 dimensions). Shouldn't this mean that the net effect on the exact center of the shell from any symmetrical arrangement of the domains be 0?

So, science redditors, can you point out where my understanding is incorrect? I tried to look for an animation gif that would demonstrate this effect but couldn't find one.


long question shorter:

To ensure I'm doing this correctly I'll post my process: using F = G ( m1 * m2 / r^2 ) [from here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation#Modern_form) and using the closest approach distance as the radius. Then a = F/m where F is the force (N) given in the previous equation and m (kg) is from either planet - assuming the answer is in m/s^2. So this gives the acceleration at closest approach, and I'm assuming I could evaluate this against some kind of threshold to determine a safe amount.

Edit: Just to clarify, this is not a homework question (on reflection I noticed it may sound that way). I'm a game developer trying to implement a realistic and customisable solar system into my game.

I'm just kind of thinking about this and wondering if this is correct.

So for all purposes in this thread, we'll use the speed of sound through stainless steel- 5800 m/s- to keep descriptions and ideas kind of homogeneous.

So, from what I understand of the speed of sound through solids (Engineering student taking senior level classes right now, so please correct me if I'm wrong), is that when you apply force on an object, the force is essentially translated through the object at the speed of sound (so if I apply force P=1kN at point A on a rod 5800 m long, P' at point B will be 1kN one second later).

That being said, would the translation of the rod be staggered? If my rod moves 1m in one second, would the rod be shorter 1m until the force reaches point B and the rod starts to move? If so, would the Generalized Hooke's Law properly model the change in volume and length of the rod of this, or would it not be applicable because there isn't a true P' at the other end causing compression?

To take this one step further, if what I think is going on is true, I'm going to set up a thought experiment and see what you think about it.

Assume you have a perfect sphere the same proportions of earth (assume a circumference of 40 million and one meters) and with the same gravity, laws of physics, etc. I have a steel rod that rests perfectly on the surface of the sphere (and contours to it) and let's say it's 40 million meters long. If there's no friction and I push one end of the rod one meter from its original position, will it take the other end (which is one meter behind me) 6897 seconds to also move a meter?

Now that I think of it, is this also related somewhat to the movement of earthquakes?

My current understanding of dark matter is that from our math there is missing mass in the universe that we cannot observe/explain.  We've lumped this into the term ""dark matter"", and it is believed to be some type of particle(s).  

Say you had a particle with a diameter near the plank length, that is dispersed throughout this empty space.  I would imagine this is impossible to observe ever.  The rough math I did on the back of a napkin here using a conservative particle density and some numbers I googled for size of the universe, mass of visible matter, and estimated total mass of the universe say that this should be justifiable given how much ""empty space"" there actually is.  

Someone please teach me a little more about this because I'm sure it isn't this easy and I am genuinely interested in why people are searching for dark matter and whether or not our efforts are fruitless.  Thanks!

In Mass Effect, the explanation for the increased power of weapons is found in the codex entry for mass accelerator tech:

&gt;A slug lightened by a mass effect field can be accelerated to greater speeds, permitting projectile velocities that were previously unattainable. If accelerated to a high enough velocity, a simple paint chip can impact with the same destructive force as a nuclear weapon.

I understand the underlying concept here, as it is simply referring to the formula for kinetic energy, F = mv^2 /2.  What I don't understand is how this results in more power.  

To illustrate, say you have a 1 kg slug and can apply enough force to accelerate it to 1000 m/s (i.e. 500k N).  Now say you use the mass effect to decrease that slug's mass to .1 kg.  You could now accelerate it to roughly 2236 m/s by my calculations (using the formula for kinetic energy).  However, it would still have the same amount of force upon impact, so I don't see how firepower is increased unless you can generate more force to begin with, which would translate to more firepower with or without the mass effect (disregarding that higher velocity means less bullet drop, etc).

I've been studying linguistics lately (via the [MIT OCW Intro Linguistics course](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/linguistics-and-philosophy/24-900-introduction-to-linguistics-fall-2012/)) and there's this concept of the ""lexicon."" Linguists suppose – and there's some evidence to this effect – that every speaker of a language has a mental reference table called the lexicon. The lexicon contains an ""entry"" for every word the speaker knows, with ""fields"" for the word's meaning(s), pronunciation, and grammatical properties. It's all presented as very orderly, and the model has held up for many decades.

My question is this: given what we know about information storage in the brain, could we ever *localize* the lexicon? A pattern so orderly and extensive in the mind would appear equally orderly in the physical connections between neurons and groups of neurons, right? Will we ever be able to point at a structure in the brain and say ""That's the lexicon,"" or even perhaps ""That's the lexical entry for the word 'sandwich'""?

If you may please read this short explanation of an eddy current braking diagram (picture included): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current#/media/File:Eddy_current_brake_diagram.svg


""A diagram showing how a disk-type eddy current brake works. Eddy current brakes are used in power tools like circular saws to stop the blade quickly, and in electric meters. The brake consists of a spinning conductive metal disk (D) spinning counterclockwise in this example, whose surface is positioned between the poles of a magnet (N and S). The magnetic field (B, green) passing downward through the disk, induces circular electric currents (I, red), called eddy currents in the metal of the disk. **At the leading edge of the magnet (left) the magnetic flux is increasing, so the eddy current is counterclockwise. At the trailing edge of the magnet (right) the magnetic flux is decreasing, so the eddy current is clockwise.** Due to Lenz's law, the eddy currents create counter magnetic fields (blue) which oppose the magnetic field which created them. At the leading edge of the magnet (left), the counterfield is directed up, creating an opposing force between the surface of the disk and the magnet. At the trailing edge (right) the counterfield is directed down, creating an attractive force between the departing surface of the disk and the magnet. Both these forces oppose the motion of the disk, acting as a drag force slowing it down. The kinetic energy of the disk's rotation is dissipated as heat by the eddy currents flowing through the resistance of the metal.""

**My question is,** when they talk about the magnetic field (magnetic flux) increasing at the leading edge of the magnet, why are the eddy current counterclockwise? What is the relationship between either an increasing/decreasing magnetic field in relation to whether the current moves clockwise or anti-clockwise?

With the classical interpretation, interference happens between the light waves as they travel through the apparatus, and so there will only be interference if the waves interact with each other, and so when one path (let's say the upper path in the diagram) is much longer than the other path (the lower path), no interference will be detected until the wave from the other path reaches the second beam splitter (B2) and subsequently the detector(s).

With the quantum interpretation, the interference happens with the [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function), and [interaction isn't necessary for interference to occur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction-free_measurement), whether by firing particles one-by-one so only one occupies the apparatus at a time or by other means. The wave function is non-local so I'm not sure you can talk about its ""propagation"" in space, since its effects are ""instantaneous"" and sometimes can be described as propagating backwards in time.

So my question is...

If you do an experiment with an interferometer as described above, with one path much longer than the other (say the upper path is 1m and the lower path is 1,000,000,000m or approximately 3.33 light seconds), will you still have interference (D1 always fires, D2 never fires) in the 3.33 seconds where the light hasn't even arrived at the second beam splitter?",,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,self,"If one section of an interferometer is orders of magnitude longer than the other, will there still be interference between the particles/beams?",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3lbhey/if_one_section_of_an_interferometer_is_orders_of/,,,self,"{'images': [{'id': 'eikueEbKZh4w-t7g9gNgAPFP5KW6slxR-ZG-4utmTDg', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/KpWeXuITLtH_OCnKI3L7OjxEHamVmrg4cHtURTuZ1Uc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=9aae54b7ae9790f1eec87ce44c59cfcf', 'width': 108}, {'height': 120, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/KpWeXuITLtH_OCnKI3L7OjxEHamVmrg4cHtURTuZ1Uc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=17522e15d6010fe004634f1fa9494944', 'width': 216}, {'height': 178, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/KpWeXuITLtH_OCnKI3L7OjxEHamVmrg4cHtURTuZ1Uc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=e8882cbf52ea19f91608415eb4487229', 'width': 320}, {'height': 356, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/KpWeXuITLtH_OCnKI3L7OjxEHamVmrg4cHtURTuZ1Uc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=a515b29434ed6ad10dd9b9c998678833', 'width': 640}, {'height': 535, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/KpWeXuITLtH_OCnKI3L7OjxEHamVmrg4cHtURTuZ1Uc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=921da8364583da8a32337decedc8ba67', 'width': 960}], 'source': {'height': 568, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/KpWeXuITLtH_OCnKI3L7OjxEHamVmrg4cHtURTuZ1Uc.jpg?s=896ab74c96ded6ee26798c5b52e29fb4', 'width': 1019}, 'variants': {}}]}",1442509851.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,1436979480.0,{},{},,,,

Is there a name for the fallacy?**  There are plenty of problems with this process of choosing a winner, since the winner will likely receive less than 50% of the votes, meaning most of the viewers think that the contestant shouldn't have won. 

Another problem is that there's no guarantee that this #1 contestant in the Round of 10 would win if those who voted for contestants #3 through #10 had to re-vote between #1 and #2.  

Lastly, there's no guarantee that even *anyone* in the top 3-4 in the round of 10 would finish in the top 2 if they eliminated contestants one by one, with the voters for the eliminated contestants instead voting for, say, contestants #5 and #6 to the point that #5 and #6 end up in the top 2, and the initial #1 and winner of the 10 finishes 6th.

____________________________________________________________________________________

America's Got Talent is a talent show that awards a winner at the end of the season.  They use fan-voting to determine who should advance and eventually make it to the final 10 contestants, and the final 10 contestants represent the 10 highest vote-getters.  Then, they have a night where viewers vote for their winner, and then the finale reveals the contestant who received the most votes, and that person WINS simply by getting a plurality, not majority, of the votes..

This format  raises a lot of problems:

* **Problem #1: The ""winner"" is likely someone whom most of America (as in, most of the viewers) thinks shouldn't win out of the 10**

Sure, there's the mathematical possibility that out of 10 contestants, there's one who gets over 50% of the votes while the other 9 get less than 50%.  But let's ignore that extremely unlikely situation.

Ignoring that scenario, that would mean the winner would have most of ""America"" thinking ""I didn't think he should have won,"" since they all voted for someone else.

For example, let's say the winner (let's call him Bob) is crowned because he got the most votes, with 25% of the votes.  Obviously, that means 75% of the viewers thought that Bob shouldn't win.

*** Problem #2: We don't even know if the winner, Bob, would win in a head-to-head voting match-up with the runner-up**

So, during the voting of 10, let's say the percentages ranged from a high of 25% to a low of 3% for the 10th-place finisher.  The runner-up (Alice) has, say, 20%.  Just for this example, let's assume that #3 though #10 are out of the picture, and now America must vote for Bob or Alice.  Even though Bob was the winner of 10, there's no guarantee he'd be the winner against Alice in a pool of 2.

Those who voted for contestants #3 through #10 can't vote for those contestants anymore and are now stuck with Bob and Alice.  What if all those voters now vote for Alice?  That means Bob, who won with 25% in the round of 10, would become the runner-up in the round of 10 with still 25% while Alice wins in a landslide with 75% of the votes.  That's an extreme example, but it's still very possible that Alice still wins with something like 55% of the votes, since there's no telling as to whom the viewers who voted for #3-#10 would vote for, Bob or Alice.

But that's a problem that's not even an automatic problem...

*** Problem #3: We don't even know if Bob and Alice -- the top 2 vote-getters in the round of 10 -- would be the final 2 if they eliminated contestants one at a time.  Heck, we don't even know if #3 and #4 would finish in the top 2, either.**

Let's say instead of a finale of voting for 10, they extend it 10 weeks so that every week a contestant is eliminated by eliminating the one with the absolute lowest number of votes.  #10 is eliminated.

Now, it's just #1 through #9.  Those who voted for #10 now vote for either #3 (Dave) or #4 (Cathy), and roughly half of #10's votes now go to Dave and Cathy each.

Week 2, #8 is eliminated.  The #8 voters now vote for Dave and Cathy, with 50% and 50%.

This is repeated all the way down to 5 contestants. #5 is eliminated, and like all the other voters, #5's voters vote for Dave and Cathy.

That means with 4 contestants remaining, we have Bob with 25%, Alice with 20%, and Dave and Cathy with around 26-29% each.  This could continue until Dave and Cathy, who weren't even in the top 2 during the round of 10, are now the final 2 while #1 Bob and #2 Alice don't even make it to the finale.

Of course, there's no guarantee that even 2 of the top 4 make it to the final 2, as #5 (Erin) and #6 (Frank) could make it, depending on the initial voters for #3 and #4.  For example, same situation except Dave and Cathy had only 8.1% and 8% of voters, respectively, while Erin had 7.9% and Frank 7.8%, respectively during the round of 10.  This time, as people get eliminated, their voters vote for Erin and Frank such that Dave and Cathy get eliminated, and now Erin and Frank have around 26% to 29% of the votes in the round of 4.  Bob and Alice eventually get eliminated and Erin and Frank -- who were #5 and #6 in the round of 10, actually finish #1 and #2.

**There's a chance that the ""winner"" and #1 vote-getter of the official process and round of 10 ends up #6 if they did it by a round-by-round elimination process.**

I'm sure there are other similar problems I haven't brought up, **but the bottom line is that there's no way that a final vote to decide the champion among 10 contestants would yield the ""true people's choice"" for the winner.**",,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,self,America's Got Talent's finale has 10 contestants and the winner is chosen by fan voting and the one with the highest % of votes wins.

After Bismuth (although even Bismuth is technically radioactive), all odd number element's most stable isotopes have a vastly shorter half-life than even number elements.

To start, Polonium's(84) most stable isotope, Polonium-209 has a half life of 125 years, although the most readily available isotope (208) has a half-life of 138 days.  While neither of those are particularly long in half life terms, compared to Astatine(85) the longest lived half-life of any of its isotopes (Astatine-210) is only 8.1 hours, significantly shorter lived. 

There are many more examples of this I could bring up, so here are some involving natural elements:

Radon(86)'s most stable isotope is Radon-222 (also it appears the most common) with a half-life of 3.8 days.

Francium(87)'s most stable isotope, Francium-223, has a half life of just 21.8 minutes.  Only a few other isotopes of Francium have half-lives longer than a minute.

Radium's(88) most stable and most common isotope is Radium-226, with a half life of 1600 years approximately.

Actinium(89) on the other hand, is more unstable with its's most stable isotope, Actinium-227, having a half life of 21.7 years.  It's next most stable isotope, Ac-225 has a half life of only 10 days.

Thorium(90) is a different story with it's most stable and most common isotope, Th-232, having a half-life of 14.05 billion years, longer than the accepted age of the universe.

Protactinium's(91) most stable isotope, Pa-231, has a half-life of 32,760 years.  It's next most stable isotope , Pa-233, half-life is only 27 days.

Finally Uranium(92).  Its most stable isotope, 238, has a half-life of 4.468 billion years, or nearly as long as the age of the earth.  Also, it's second most stable isotope, U-235, has a half-life of 703 million years.  

Also, as a bonus question, is this occurrence and the fact that the two non-transuranic elements that don't occur in nature (Technetium(43) and Promethium(61)) at all related?

Laymen's explanation of its use and method of action:  For MS patients, its the most extreme treatment option.  It won't stop the progression of MS but does slow it down and hopefully prolong or minimize the chance of developing secondary progressive MS.   It acts like micro-condoms on immune cells, preventing them from passing the blood brain barrier.

Downside of that last part is that the immune system is partially compromised and increases the risk of developing a PML infection in the brain or similarly developing a HSV2 brain infection.  Neither are good and the survival rate has been pretty bad.

As an experimental psycholinguist, I wonder to what extent speech recognition technology is shaped by what we understand about speech recognition in humans. In the other thread, a lot of people seemed to be saying that speech recognition is done through simple template matching. My questions are: 

1) Is all speech recognition technology just simple template matching right now?

and

2) If so, are people working on speech recognition technology aiming to improve this by incorporating knowledge from experimental research?

---

My own thoughts on speech recognition are as follows:

Ultimately, sounds can usefully be described by their values on various acoustic dimensions such as formant frequency, voice onset time, frication, etc etc. These are all things that can be pretty easily automatically extracted from the speech stream. But of course the obvious problem is lack of invariance -- different people produce the same sounds differently, and sometimes produce different sounds the same way. 

But we do know a little bit about how people handle this problem via work on phonetic adaptation. People can shift their sound category boundaries around after being exposed to people who show a clear distributional shift in a particular cue value for some sound (for example, their [p]'s shift in VOT to sound more like [b]'s). This itself would be pretty easy to implement, right? The system has some default distribution for each sound over the mean and variance of the various cues (which is formed by aggregating across all speakers the system has been trained on), but then you simply update those distributions to account for the statistical pattern observed in a new speaker.

The one problem that arises there is that in order to gather this data, you somehow need to know with high certainty what sound a speaker produced, which can be difficult when you have high uncertainty about what word was produced. Maybe you could solve this by having people produce words with very low phonological neighborhood densities in some training session, but I'm not sure that would solve the problem.",,,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,self,What is the state of the art in speech recognition technology?

I figured in this scenario the best method would to simply the practical formula for dry air Cair = (331.3 + 0.606 * ℃) m/s - since I likely won't have access to an adiabatic index on every planet/moon, it probably wouldn't be best to factor in Ideal Gas Law, and instead it'd be better to just give a simple approximation if I'm only going to calculate speed of sound for RT60.

To pass your own wake you'd have to go faster than the wave speed of water, which is unfortunately complicated. I read that the highest wave ever recorded was 112 ft from trough to crest (34.137m) in some ocean. The wave traveled at 23 m/s.

I have a question regarding gravity assists hopefully an expert can help with, specifically, doing multiple sequential gravity assists with the same body as was done with MESSENGER, Mariner 10, Rosetta, etc.

I'm trying to model the trajectory of MESSENGER, which is seen [here](http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/the_mission/images/traj_helioecl_earth2moi2_10292010.jpg)

So, first I noticed that the probe was launched from Earth on what looks like a radial trajectory - its first orbit intersects Earth, but is slightly offset. After one year and without any Deep Space Maneuvers, it flies by the Earth again, presumably leaving the Earth in the retrograde direction to continue on to Venus.

My question is, why did it do that? 

A planet will change the velocity of a passing object relative to the Sun, not itself - rather it changes the object's direction relative to itself. If a probe enters a planet's gravity at 100m/s, it will always leave at 100m/s, but potentially in a different direction relative to the planet, and as the planet is a fast moving body this can greatly affect the heliocentric orbit. An observer on Earth would see the probe come and go at the same speed (right?)

So if MESSENGER was launched and escaped from Earth the first time at 100m/s, it would come back around at 100m/s a year later, right? After the gravity assist, wouldn't it leave Earth at that same speed relative to Earth (100m/s) but in the retrograde direction to head to Venus? Why didn't they just launch it retrograde at that speed to begin with? Am I misunderstanding gravity assists, is there some n-body thing at work here, or what?

I've got all kinds of questions about this mission, but the thing I'm having the most trouble with is how they can keep getting more momentum (or rather losing momentum here) assisting off the same planet multiple times.

They are walking along a hallway roughly 8' wide and 8' tall.

On [this website](http://www.dvandom.com/coriolis/spacestation.html) the author details how you would feel heavier if you move with the rotation (increasing your angular momentum) and lighter if you went against the rotation.

In the book, it takes them a very long time to walk around the whole of the space station. They don't state exactly how long, but 9.42 hours at a walking pace (5km/hr) seems like a good estimate.

radius = (9.42hr * 5000m/hr) / (2 * pi) ≈ 7500m

Knowing that velocity^2 / radius = acceleration, and we are aiming for 9.8m/s^2, v=sqrt(a*r) ≈ 270m/s or about 600mph.

Even at a running pace of 6.7m/s (15mph) you are only going to be able to have a 2.5% impact on your relative rotational velocity.

So, on a station this massive, would it feel any different walking with vs. against the rotation? Would the actual upward curve of the floor be noticeable (visually or when moving)?

So I just finished a lot of books on the subject of evolution and watched a couple YouTube videos on the topic. and I saw somewhere that humans are actually for a large part consisting out of other organisms that we have a symbiotic relationship with because they are also part of our evolution and we need each other. and that basicly to see it from the microbes perspective they together with al other microbes basicly ""help"" build a platform that will hopefully give them an edge over other microbes.

so that got me thinking about that we humans maybe do kind of the same thing again when we for instance build city's. where we all live in these places that are the perfect living areas for us and we provide our self with different organs (company s) that specialize in food,development,energy, transport of resources. and our infrastructure of roads also resemble the blood vein's in an animal. Now with adding the internet we are finally adding a ingenious nervous system to this macro organism and it can now actually start too feel and comprehend the world around it if forms of weather stations satellites cameras and of course manual input from its multiple subjects (us) these cities also off course work with each other on a bigger scale to together form this big fungus like organism that engulfs the earth.

off course I know that it is a bit far-fetched to call this an organism already but it certainly has resemblances with it and it will be more and more and more in the future.

-Line segments that mark North to South and West to East; lined up properly by using a compass.

-Two rays starting at the vertex of the aforementioned mentioned N/S &amp; W/E lines that point out in an Easterly direction.  Their ends will mark roughly the heading of the rising sun on summer solstice and winter solstice respectively.

-Between the two ""sun rise points"" (mentioned above) I will use a ""mobius strip"" (even though it wont be an *actual* mobius strip) on which i will mark the beginning of each month.  So if you look at it during sunrise you can ball park the date (month and week)

-I would also like the ""twist"" point of the modius strip (mentioned above) to coincide with the sunrise azimuth on the day of an equinox.  I'm assuming that this day could be shared by the same point for both equinoxes but I could be wrong.

-I also want to include another ray starting from the vertex of the cardinal lines that points towards the north star.  *I'm open to suggestions for any other number of interesting things that I could chart on this model* :)

[Here is a very, very rough idea of what I'm looking for](http://i.imgur.com/WSUNX5S.jpg).  At what degree on the face of this device should the summer solstice be plotted, the winter solstice, and both or either of the equinoxes and is there a formula for me to calculate where they should be for my location in the world?  Has anyone seen something like this done before in this way and can give us some good examples for direction/inspiration?

-----

I've been trying to use [this online tool](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/ ) to calculate the azimuth of sun rise on the aforementioned dates; but I'm not sure I'm using it right.  

For example I'll use New York, New York.  I set the lat/long, time zone offset of -5 and check mark DST because I'll be using 21 June 2015 as the date and 5:25 am as the time.  The tool gives me 57.5 degrees with an elevation of about 0.  Seems right I think.  So sunrise would be @57.5 on the compass correct?

BUT this doesn't help my kid learn anything, or me for that matter.  So can I calculate this for myself rather than relying on internet tools?  Of course, the last thing I want is to take my daughter to check our calendar on the date of the winter solstice to find that its off by 10 degrees or more; but this is about learning and doing something together...(even though I'm asking you all haha)

I was watching Masters of Sex recently (an American tv drama based on the lives of sexologists [Virginia Johnson and William Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_and_Johnson)) and in the show they mention using an EKG and an EEG to gather readings during sex. As far as I know an EKG and EEG just monitor the voltage fluctuations in the heart and brain, ie: the contractions of the heart muscles (heart rate) and neural impulses during brain activity. Both of these seemed like rather unsuitable means of measuring an orgasm because, well... 1950's.  But also because they don't seem to directly correspond to a surge of oxytocin we know today as the Big O. 

I get that Masters' and Johnson's research had to start somewhere -and for that, the EKG and EEG were enough to give them a general framework to understand what happens during sex. What bothers me is the way they talk about their research findings in the show. Obviously this could just be the show, but from the way they talk, you'd think that an orgasm would be categorically identifiable as a particular spike on a waveform read-out. 

""And there it is. That's when you had an orgasm."" 

""...Did I?""

If measuring a female orgasm was that simple, we could probably just strap HRM watches on our partners and get instant feedback on our performance. 

So what techniques do researchers use today? Are they precise? Because while I'm sure they can monitor the muscle spasms in the vaginal canal during sex, I'm not so sure the event of an orgasm always strictly corresponds to a particular muscular contraction either. 

On the other hand, I also don't imagine they can just watch the chemistry of your brain while you orgasm. 

Do researchers have a way to measure the intensity of muscle contractions that would reflect some kind of subtle variation from one orgasm to the next? And what about male orgasms?

My rudimentary research led me to understand the following:

* the only thing blood flow does for melanocytes is carry melanocortins from the pituitary gland

A [couple](http://users.etown.edu/s/stuckeym/AJP1992a.pdf) of [papers](http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0011070v2.pdf) I found seem to stick to redshift explanations, but then I remembered something I'd learned about nuclear reactors.

[Cherenkov radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation) is emitted when a charged particle passes through a medium at a speed greater than the *phase velocity* of light in that medium (e.g. water).  The characteristic blue glow in an underwater nuclear reactor is a result of this Cherenkov radiation.

I surmised that Cherenkov radiation might just be such a symptom, so I naively googled ""Cherenkov radiation dark matter"" and found [this paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.3683.pdf) by a Kazakh scientist, LM Chechin.  With all due respect to Mr Chechin, his English phrasing throughout the paper is awkward and I am certainly no physicist, so the significance of his findings are entirely a mystery to me.

I'm hoping someone here can help me understand this better.

1. If there is Cherenkov radiation either emanating from or otherwise hanging around the dark matter halo of distant galaxies, then what exactly is exceeding phase velocity in this case?  

2. In addition, what is the *medium* in this case, the vacuum of space or something else?  

3. Finally, does this have anything to do with galaxies receding faster than the speed of light?

--------

UPDATE: After carefully re-reading Chechin's paper and the wiki on Cherenkov radiation, I think I've answered my own questions.  Thanks to those that took the time to respond!  

What the [IACT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IACT) guys are doing is analyzing high-energy gamma and X-rays passing through the earth's atmosphere.  So as far as the scientific facts go that answers questions #1 &amp; #2: high-energy particles from outside the solar system are exceeding the phase velocity of light *in our atmosphere*, triggering a very short (5 to 20 *ns*) flash of Cherenkov radiation which is detected by a telescope array.  So the answer to question #3 quickly follows: this probably has nothing to do with expansion.

But one of the neat goals of [CTA](https://portal.cta-observatory.org/Pages/Dark-Matter.aspx) is to detect dark matter annihilation in the galactic center.  And this is where his paper gets provocative ... Chechin proposes that much like how charged particles in galactic space (see [Wolf-Rayet stars](https://books.google.com/books?id=yzvrCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA501&amp;lpg=PA501&amp;dq=wolf-rayet+particles+shock+wave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-8TQIW9EUi&amp;sig=3uBT58IJBLVxzg-qxs5R6CiXB_8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMIzqy55rmTxgIVTTWICh0xHQA4#v=onepage&amp;q=wolf-rayet%20particles%20shock%20wave&amp;f=false)) can be accelerated by plasma shocks, a very small number of these shocked particles could then *in addition* be further accelerated by passing through a galaxy's dark matter halo (yay gravity!), which might then in principle emit Cherenkov radiation *in the dark matter medium* that could be detectable, indirectly pointing us more precisely to where the dark matter might be.  

At least that's how I read it.  Let's be clear: Chechin's paper is a preprint, and as someone else mentioned, it probably hasn't been peer-reviewed nor published anywhere.

So, based off a conversation with my girlfriend today and then further conversation with my roommate we have a question about infinite data storage. This came about after discussing a previous question which I will explain below the main post so you can see the progression. However, for now I will get into the meat.

Assuming perfect-control devices (for spinning electrons and sending them along a perfect path) and measuring devices (for seeing the electrons’ state), could we use electrons (possibly harvested from the solar wind (a source of ""potentially data-containing particles"" that is infinite enough for the human race's timeline of existence), spin them based on bit structure (1 for positive spin, 0 for negative spin) then send them into a vector of space that contains no celestial bodies (or at least no celestial bodies moving slower than 2200 km/s (or the fastest speed of some other particle that could contain data)), moving away from us to create a massive stream of data that is accessible in a way that allows data access in a fraction of the time it has taken to move outward, from the time it was sent past earth and ""spun""?

Further, could we do this in such a way that the particles could (again assuming perfect-control and measurement) be “spiraled” (see definition below) outward in such a way that every particle would be visible from earth and accounted for based on red-shift? The spiral metrics could potentially control data compression and accessibility time.

This all developed from a conversation that started out pondering the installation of mirrors in space, which could be used to see into the past, by controlling the path of light reflected from the earth. We soon realized that this is no better than simple video recording and that the data storage and access are the real issue at hand.

Definition of ""spiraled"": Using mass (assuming perfect placement and size) or some form of particle movement manipulation to set the path of the electrons into a spiral pattern which would allow movement away from source to be less than 2200 km/s.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7h6mS7x-Rg

In it they mention the use of some kind of drone to measure the amount of water depleted underground. Pretty sure it's this:

https://earthdata.nasa.gov/community/community-data-system-programs/access-projects/high-spatial-temporal-resolution

Anyway, the GRACE system measures the amount of ground water based on gravity, and it got me thinking, if this system can be altered by even slight changes in ground water level, why couldn't weather patterns?

My background is in Biochemistry and Chemistry, so I can't claim to be any kind of expert on Meteorology, but is it possible that by reducing the levels of ground water, we're making it less likely that rain clouds will be drawn to that particular area of the world? Again, my knowledge of weather is limited, but wouldn't a higher gravitational pull be more likely to draw storm clouds?

First let me give you a little background. In a 3d game development engine (UE4 for anyone wondering) I'm trying to build a realistic, albeit very small, physics-driven solar system simulator. The end goal is to have any number of random mass objects placed at random locations in 3d space and have them attract, orbit, and rotate each other realistically. One of my first problems is the issue of scale and shrinking the tremendous masses, distances, and speeds that exist in space. The second problem I am running into is as the title says, calculating when an object is, or setting an object to be in a stable orbit (not crashing into a star, and not with enough velocity to escape). I think the second problem will be solved when the first problem is.

As for the first problem, the three(?) variables that need to be scaled are mass, distance (radius), and the Gravitational Constant. These need to be scaled; one for practicality and game play, and two because in many instances, values as big as real life literally cannot be stored because of there size. I really don't know if what I am trying to do is mathematically sound. Currently these are my arbitrary conversions:

1 uukg (Unreal unit kilogram) = 10 ^ 24 kg

1 uum = 1,000,000 m

This puts the Earth at 5.97 uukg, the Sun at 1,990,000 uukg, and the distance between them about 150,000 uum; just for scale. These values are acceptable and can be easily calculable. The next step is finding the new Gravitational Constant value. By just experimenting and finding a value that creates nice behavior in the game, the constant I'm using is 100. This can be easily changed, and I have a hunch that it will need to be. Here is a sample of what I am calculating and applying right now.

F(grav) = 100 N uum^2 / uukg^2 * (5.97 uukg * 1990000 uukg) / 150000 uum

comes out to

F = 7920 ""N""

I don't know if I am allowed to do those calculations with my scale, but if my Gravitation Constant is in the right unit to give force the newton unit, why not? I'm going to pretend for now. Currently, this calculation works and it is applying gravity to the two objects. No matter what I randomly set the initial velocity as, the orbit either spirals toward the sun, or is greater than the escape velocity. So I need to calculate at what speed and distant will the smaller of these two objects will stably orbit the larger, which I will call Earth and Sun. Kepler tells us that orbital speed equals the square root of, the Gravitational Constant times the mass of the central object over the radius (I'm not even going to try and format). So plugging in my values and units, the equation should look like:

v = sqrt(100 N uum^2 / uukg^2 * (1990000 uukg / 150000 uum))

comes out to 

v = 115 uum/s ?

Shit, this feels stupid. I'm not sure if any of this is making sense. If anyone can offer any assistance or wants to contribute to the project, that would be extremely appreciated.

However, after the test I remembered that there is a central Mg ion and I though that maybe the rest of the molecules act as ligands for it.

A second large ([magnitude 7.3 ish](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20002ejl#scientific_tensor) - this is likely to be revised in the coming hours as more data is collated) earthquake has occurred in Nepal this morning. This is related to the [M7.8 which occurred last month](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20002926#scientific_tensor) also in Nepal.

These earthquakes are occurring on fauilts related to the ongoing collision of the Indian subcontinent into Asia, which in turn s building the HImalayan plateau through a complex structure of fault and folding activity.

[Thrust faults are generally low angle (&lt;30 degree) faults, in which the upper surface moves over the lower surface to shorten  the total crustal length, and increase crustal thickness around the fault](http://facweb.bhc.edu/academics/science/harwoodr/Geol101/study/Images/Thrust.gif).  Because of the large weight of overlying rock, and the upward movement required by the [headwall (or hanging wall)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cKknu9lsZbQ/T207I50MoNI/AAAAAAAAGr4/JbZSApxFK5M/s1600/Headwall+and+footwall.jpg) of the fault, these types of fault are able to accumulate enormous stresses before failure, which in turn leads to these very large magnitude events.

The earthquake in April has had a number of aftershocks related to it, as when an earthquake occurs the stress field around a fault system changes, and new peak-stress locations form elsewhere. This can cause further movement on the same or adjacent faults nearby.

If you refer to http://www.corrosion-doctors.org/Experiments/rust-chemistry.htm, you'll find that they say that ""More acidic water increases corrosion."" I know this is a conventional given across our planet - lower pH indeed increases the rate of rust. But why? It's got to do with hydrogen evolution, how, as per their site, hydrogen ions react with the electrons (2H+(aq) + 2e- --&gt; H2(g)) in preference to the usual reaction of (4e- + 4H+(aq) + O2(aq) --&gt; 2H2O(l)). Then they go on to say that the actual rust solid is formed by Fe2+(aq) + 2OH-(aq) --&gt; Fe(OH)2(s), which takes hydroxide ions as a reactant. But where are the hydroxide ions in an acidic solution? They say that 'as the pH increases, hydroxide ions appear'. This means that the pH must get to 7 and above that, as this is the point where excess OH- ions are in solution.

L = r*m*v

L is angular momentum
r is distance from the mass to the axis of rotation
m is mass
v is linear velocity of the mass


If you'd compare it to the [formula for linear momentum (for a single particle)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum#Single_particle):


P = m * v

where P is the linear momentum, and 'm' and 'v' are the same as above.


You see that in the formula for angular momentum the radius pops op without any equivilant variable in the formula for linear momentum.


My question is; This difference seems to imply that conservation of angular momentum doesn't mean you necessary conserve linear momentum (and the other way around), is this true? And if that is the case, where would the formula for angular momentum come from?



Note:
Obviously there is a difference in the way the velocities 'work' in both formulae as the velocity itself would be a funcion of the radius in the case of angular momentum while it is constant for all praticles in linear momentum.

I'm aware that things become more complex and there are many exceptions, so I'll refrain from using words like ""always"" or ""never."" If there is something that is ""always"" or ""never"" by definition, please do say so.

Here's what I think I understand:

We humans have 48 chromosomes, comprised of 24 pairs, with each pair comprised of a chromosome from each parent. 

My question comes, is to how genes, alleles, and chromosomes relate. We will assume this pea plant has 1 recessive allele, (s), for the trait for wrinkles, and 1 dominant allele (S) for the trait of being smooth: If you look at the mess of DNA located in the nucleus, you can say that there are many, many, many genes. However, we know that there is 1 gene we can define. 

We can say there must be a sequence of DNA that, if expressed, would yield wrinkles in the plant. This sequence, that we call allele (s), is recessive so it is not expressed. Instead, another, different segment of DNA is expressed, called allele (S). These two, different segments of DNA are located in different positions in space, are in fact the same gene, but in alternate forms (alleles). 

In short, this plant has 1 gene, defined by 2 alleles in different locations, and will be smooth because one dominant allele is being expressed while the recessive other isn't. 

If you look at this plant after the DNA has been compacted into distinct chromosomes, you will see a chromosome pair. 1 chromosome has allele (S), and the other allele (s). This chromosome pair contains the gene for smooth/wrinkled skin. After replication, in preparation for Meiosis, there are still 2 chromosomes. 1 chromosome is comprised of sister chromatids with each chromatid having allele (s), and the other chromosome is comprised of sister chromatids with each chromatid having allele (S).

Are my statements correct?

There is a simple theory that says somewhere there is a digital picture of myself standing on an airplane.

The chances of it happening are close to none. 

My question and something I cant seem to understand... If we could try every possible binary combination, or at least begin computing different binary combinations. Would we find something useful? The only catch to this is how do we know what these binary combinations can do? are they compile-able? 

In my opinion, this is the first step to AI. Once the machine can understand code written from outside of itself. Or better yet, self compiling and understanding. It will be able to write its own random code and come up with new programs/pictures/code that are entirely its own.

You are actually a computer, so you won't run out of oxygen and have infinite patience. Would it be possible to make it to the ground without burning up?

Your hang glider has a lift-to-drag ratio of 10, which wikipedia says is low-balling it.

Survival seems absurd, but I am having a hard time figuring out exactly why. You would start out with just the miniscule tug from the atmosphere. That tug would slowly grow as you were dragged downwards into the atmosphere. But at any point, you could use your lift to keep your altitude up and your drag down, until the point that you stall. I'm not a airplane-ologist, but it seems like stalling would happen (order-of-magnitude-ly) when your weight exceeds your lift. And your lift is ten times your drag. So, if you drive just right, you could keep your drag down to a tenth of your weight and maintain a just-barely-not-stall. A drag that small is not going to pump a lot of energy into you at once, so it seems like you would not burn up.

So what is wrong with that story?

This however does not account for gravitational compression so the actual volume would probably be somewhat smaller while the average density and surface gravity would probably be a bit higher.

How do I go about calculating the decrease in volume?

If one tries to write up how this is supposed to work,. this leads quickly to very implausible numbers.

As an example, 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extramarital_sex

The puzzling point is this: We know that to every sexual encounter belong two people (at least). Also, the great majority of people behaves mostly heterosexual, that means that for every male having a sexual relationship there is a female participating, too. (For the sake of simplicity, I will omit homosexual people and paid sex from the following consideration - it will not change the conclusion significantly).

**If these numbers were consistent, the number of sexual partners per percentile in the population would need to be vastly different for men and woman.** As a slightly exaggerated example, let's assume that each male has on average two sexual partners and each female only one. We now can make assumptions how the numbers are distributed across [percentiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile). One of the possible distributions looks like this:

    D = Decile 
    nm = average number of partners in heterosexual males 
    nf = average number of partners in heterosexual females
    S = sum of sexual partners across all deciles

     D   nm  nf
     1    2    0
     2    2    1
     3    2    1
     4    2    1
     5    2    1
     6    2    1
     7    2    1
     8    2    1
     9    2    1
    10    2   12
     --------------
     S   20   20

In short, one ultra-promiscous woman would need to make up for the chastity of nine others by having twelve times more sexual partners than her fellow women. Still, both sexes would have an average of two sexual partners each. This distribution can't explain the numbers from Kinsey and others, and in fact no distribution in which the summed number of partners across all deciles are equal can.In any such distribution, the average number of partners for heterosexual males and females will be equal! 

This just isn't plausible. One can try to explain this by arguing that married and unmarried persons behave different in both sexes. It is often maintained that men do have more extramarital affairs, but this would have the consequence that unmarried females are far more promiscuous than men, which is even less plausible. Is there any more logical distribution? How is the number of sexual partner actually distributed across percentiles for both sexes and for the married / unmarried populations? Is there any plausible explanation for average numbers of sexual partners  that are not equal?

After this explanation I immediately thought of Maxwell's self-propagating electromagnetic wave, thinking perhaps an EM-wave ""shows"" me its magnetic ""side"" or electric ""side"" (aspect? quality? etc.) only depending on my reference frame, but both exist entirely; inextricably woven together, whether I view them as standalone or as some combination.

I was doing some reading and talking with people in my department, and I learned something that really was strange to me: [*Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (Budding or Baker's yeast) is capable of undergoing apoptosis](http://jcb.rupress.org/content/175/4/521.full). They possess a caspase-like protein, translocate phosphotidylserine from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to the out leaflet during this process, and a decrease in [cardiolipin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2788820/) results in the release of cytochrome c and other proapoptotic factors into the cytosol. 

I believe *Candida albicans* can also undergo apoptosis, but I am not nearly as well read on that matter. This appears to happen after a failure to mate and under oxidative or nutrient stress. My confusion lies in the fact that other yeast species such as *S. pombe* undergo necrosis rather than apoptosis in these types of conditions.

Thinking about it from an evolutionary standpoint, it doesn't really make sense. These cells are committing resources to something that will not immediately benefit surrounding cells anymore than simply becoming necrotic would. From my admittedly limited understanding of microbiology, the cells that commit the least amount of resources to things other than growth and reproduction stand the strongest chance of surviving. Committing resources to producing caspases and other proapoptotic molecules seems counterproductive to me especially when other forms of cell death exist that do not require the apoptotic machinery.

I apologize in advance, I don't know how to make mathematical markup on reddit. Please feel free to ask for clarifications if needed.  
  
  
**Statement of the Problem**  
1) Let f(x) be some function with the following properties:   
* f(x) has finite support over some known interval, S.  
* f(x) is everywhere non negative.  
* f(x) is continuous with continuous derivatives, except maybe at the boundaries of the support.  
  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
  
2) Let P(x,y) be some known function which is integrable on the interval [0,infinity).
  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
  

3) Let {Y_i} be a set of N values for which the result of the following operation is known:  
  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
  

R(Y_i) = R_i = Integral[dx * f(x) * P(x,Y_i),{from 0 to +infinity}]  
  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
  
  
4) From the knowledge of {R_i} and P(x,y), find f(x) or some approximation of f(x).
  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
  
**My solution:**  
I assume f(x) doesn't change too much over small enough intervals dx. I can then approximate f(x) as a series of N constant values over small intervals. Formally,    
  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
  

f(x) = Sum[w_j * g_j(x),{j = 0 .. N}]  
  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
  

  
Where w_j is the set of approximating constant values and g_j(x) is a set of functions which take the value 1 for the appropriate interval, j, and 0 everywhere else. The j intervals are simply equally spaced subdivisions of the finite support of f(x), S (though they don't have to be).  
  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
  

I then have,
  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
  

R_i = Sum[w_j * P_i,j, {j = 1 .. N}]  
  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
  
  
Where P_i,j is the result of the integration of the known function P(x,Y_i) over the j'th interval.  
  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
  

The problem is now reduced to inverting the matrix P_i,j and calculating inv(P_i,j)*R_i to solve for the coefficients w_j. The resulting solution is adequate for my current needs but I do have some questions with an eye to future improvements:  
  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
  

1) I'm assuming this problem (or something similar/more general) has already been studied before. I'd appreciate any links to relevant material.  
2) Is there a way to choose the intervals g_j optimally?  
3) My solution results in a discontinuous approximation of f(x) which is known to be continuous. Is there a method find an approximation that is continuous?  
  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
  
Any input would be much appreciated!

NASA's recent publicity with their delivery systems testing casts a shadow of worry about the technical/intellectual direction of the organizations that are spearheading space exploration efforts at present.  The idea that they are making huge, expensive, delivery systems capable of sending large payloads from the surface out into the inner solar system seems like very old-fashioned thinking.  ~~As your stuff gets larger, it takes ever more ridiculous amounts of energy to send it further, faster.  Sending lighter payloads are a fraction of the cost, as commercial ventures are demonstrating with their development of efficient small-scale delivery systems.~~  It seems better to find an alternate path to this process by segregating payloads into bulk/light/human and then piecing the final mission together in orbit where energy costs to move around are extremely low.

Instead of making bigger rockets for sending bigger payloads farther, why not have those bigger rockets send large exploration vehicles to a transfer station in LEO, and then have cheaper, more efficient delivery systems supply the transfer station with fuel, light equipment and personnel?  You can then conduct as many missions of any nature as you like using a reusable space exploration vehicle that would rarely have to return to the surface(if at all) saving vast amounts of expenditures in energy.  The same idea would work for deep space probes - you can put more equipment, larger/more engines and larger fuel storage on a probe, put it on a small delivery system, and have it fuel/return/refuel from deep space missions instead of relying on the majority of your energy coming from the initial launch and a small ion engine(and never seeing the probe again in the near future once you send it out), which ends up limiting the size of the probe.

Eventually you can even launch some freighter style vehicles that can head out from the depot and refuel missions afield, or deliver supplies to exploration efforts on Planets and moons throughout the rest of the system, returning with samples, lab work, data, even malfunctioning equipment/vehicles and then heading back out again.  This idea just makes supreme sense to me, and it makes no sense why we are continuing to use surface-based delivery systems to facilitate extended space exploration.  The mere existence of such a facility would make bootstrapping humanity's advance into space so much easier.

Maybe I'm missing something obvious, but if we have the technical and economic means to build the ISS and have all the data from it's extended use, surely a modest supply depot with robots controlled from the ground is not outside of the realm of possibility.

The famous macroscopic example being that all the gas in a room might randomly with *incredibly* low likelihood end up in one corner of the box.

However, is this actually true? Has such local decreases in entropy actually been observed and if they have, are they true global decreases and not just a ""trick"" that the entropy increased sufficiently elsewhere?

How would this classical discussion be transplanted to quantum frameworks involving Von Neumann entropy?  

Is the CMB fluctuations examples of these entropy fluctuations? However, in that context, wouldn't the fluctuation in fact be increases entropy away from the ""perfect"" homogeneous fluid? In solid state, there is always a population of point defects in crystals as a function of temperature, these are here precisely because of the effect of entropy on the energy of the system. In fact, can't we write an analogous Boltzmann's epitaph S = k lnW for both systems to show that these are indeed in agreement with the second law?

I don't have much knowledge in this area, but I would bet that for an application that requires good resistance to impact, concrete would not be a choice material.

As far as I understand (and please correct me, since I’m probably off base), the properties of concrete that make it unfavorable are its hardness and brittleness. When subject to impact, concrete won't deform much since it’s hard, thus cannot dissipate the energy and as a result will fracture because of its brittle nature. I suppose this means it has a low toughness, since a small deformation causes fracture.

How does the strain-rate effect the fracture? An impact load would cause a very high strain rate, so that makes me wonder if different materials (or concrete mixes) have an upper limit on the rate at which they can deform? For example, a load applied gradually may not crack concrete, however if applied (almost) instantaneously it probably will. Is this because materials dissipate energy (by deforming) at a rate equal to the rate energy is being applied into to it, and if the material can’t keep up then it will fracture? I have learned that strain rates from impact can be on very different time scales (in civil applications), ex: 10E-6 to 10E-5/s for vehicle collision to 5x10E-2 to 10/s for aircraft landings.

What are a few general applications (not necessarily specific to civil) where impact resistance is an important parameter? What materials are commonly used in those applications, and what properties do those materials have that make them ideal?

I'm trying to look at things from a different perspective, since impact resistance of concrete is usually a discussed as a more secondary design parameter. Impact is often a result of an accident/extreme occurrence in civil applications, so designing for it is kind of treated as a last line of defence.

I was thinking, the Michelson–Morley experiment was one of the experiments that disproved the existence of a 'aether' for light to travel through.
However, I thought the theories postulated some interesting ideas, naming the concept of 'Aether dragging'. Which, as I understand it and again if I am wrong I duly apologise, is the effect of a spinning and rotating object has whilst moving through a medium, like the disturbances noticed when you observe a ball rotating in water perhaps. Depending on the density and viscosity of the fluid, at certain points on the body, areas of pressure would build up.

I just don't want to leave anything out so I want to clarify as best as  I can. So lets start with the key fob that you get from the factory for most cars. These are relatively standard on most vehicles and they normally operate the car alarm, the trunk, locking, and unlocking. Well common sense says that the only way that remote works is via a frequency right? Well is it an AM frequency or FM? How could you find out what frequency the remote is on? Because each car much come with a specified frequency for the simple for the simple fact that if they were on the same frequency then when I tried to unlock my car or pop the trunk it would open several other cars as well, if they were on the same frequency. So another question is, is there a specific range of frequencies used? Now let's say I sit in the walmart parking lot and just broadcast a range of frequencies. I wouldnt think this would yield much for results which would make me think maybe there is a certain pulse width of frequency that goes in a specific pattern. Then when this pattern matches what the computer is looking for the function is complete. Mind you this is all just my theory but it seems to make sense. I just would like some explanations for the questions I have above. If there is a pattern how  could one replicate that pattern? Or use the old remote to intercept the frequency so we could replicate it. Now lets jump to auto start for a second. The reason autostart works is because you bypass the cars anti theft system in a sense. This allows the car to be started without a key. Does this operate on the same basis as the factory fob? Is there a way to map out the frequency(s) needed for each specific function without having a key fob? The reason for all these questions is because I am trying to help my friend in telecomm. and he is trying to do something like this for a class project and asked for my help. I am a gear head so really anything related to cars or mechanical systems intrests me and when we were both stumped I decided to keep looking.

There are famous examples which explain why speed of light appears to be constant to an observer who is stationary and an observer who is in a spaceship due to time dilation, that is fine. However I'm not able to understand how speed of light appears constant to two observers who are in different gravitational fields.

Suppose person A is on a super dense planet and person B is somewhere far off in space. Say there are two towers on the planet. Tower 1 emits a laser directed at tower 2. Both towers have beacons at the top. When tower 1 emits the laser, the beacon on top lights up simultaneously. Likewise when tower 2 detects the laser, its beacon lights up.

Both the observers start their stopwatches as soon as they see tower 1's beacon light up and stop when they see tower 2's beacon light turns on. Since speed of light should be constant, both clock's should show the same time, i.e it takes light the same amount of time to travel a constant distance. The distance between the towers appears the same for both the observers. So, where is the time dilation for person A due to gravity? 

It would appear light takes the same x seconds to travel the same  distance s for both the observers.

I'm going to explain my understanding of the question first, then pose my question. Responses should take two forms. One is to correct misunderstanding inherent to my question, and the other is to answer my question directly.

So I know that there are 2 fundamental theorems to special relativity. 1) The speed of light is a constant in all reference frames, and 2) The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. From these two theorems time dilation follows. I'll explain the reason for this, as I understand it, with a thought experiment.

Imagine 2 observers. Observer A is sitting on earth, and observer B is travelling away at some very fast velocity. Observer A shines a light towards observer B. Obvserver B has two rings which are aligned with the source of light. The rings are 1km apart. From observer B's perspective the light travels 1km from ring 1 to ring 2. Light travels at 2.9979*108 m/s, so the light takes 3.33 microseconds to travel from ring 1 to ring 2.

From observer A's perspective after the light passes through ring 1 observer B continues to travel away, so the light actually has to traverse a bit more than 1km before reaching ring 2. Thus it takes a bit longer than 3.33 microseconds for the light to traverse from ring 1 to ring 2. This inconsistency is resolved by saying that time is actually passing more slowly for observer B than it is for observer A. This is all well and good.

Now we come to my question, and it relates the twin paradox. The twin paradox states that if a traveler goes away from the earth at near the speed of light, and back again at the same or a similar speed, that when he get's back he'll be younger than his twin due to time dilation. Based on my thinking, this isn't the case, and the twins should be exactly the same age at the end of the trip. Allow me to explain why.

The scenario I outlined above is exactly that of the twin as he makes the away journey. The scenario as the twin returns is exactly opposite however. The twin is approaching the earth at some very fast velocity. After the light passes through ring 1, from the perspective of observer B it has 1km to go, so it takes 3.33 microseconds. Observer A is where things diverge from the previous example however. In observer A's perspective, after the light passes through ring 1 the traveler continues to move towards the light source. Thus the light actually has **less** distance to traverse then 1km and takes **less** time to traverse the space then 3.33 microseconds. Using the same logic as we applied in the first example we can now say that time is actually passing faster for observer B.

In other words, based on my understanding, there should be **negative** time dilation. As the traveler is moving away time passes more slowly, and the observer ages less. As the traveler is approaching time will move faster for the traveler and he will have aged more. The net result being that by the time the traveler returns, the net change in time elapsed will be 0 between the 2 observers.

So, after reading up on the concepts of gravity and time dilation, I realized that the way we describe the speed of light is based on the concept of time (299,792,458 meters PER SECOND). But, if time is relative, how can we use it to accurately describe something, especially something that passes through different areas of space with different amounts of gravity? I made a diagram to help demonstrate my point: 

http://imgur.com/lNbTALs

(Sorry about the black background, I don't really know what I'm doing, but it's still readable). So start at the star in the middle. Now it's shooting light in all directions, but go right to reference point 1 first. It takes one year to reach our beacon there, and then 2 more years for the signal from the beacon to reach us on Earth, so 3 years total. That's our baseline. To the left, however, the path of the light goes through a section of space that has a higher amount of gravity due to a black hole being near it. Now, as far as I understand, shouldn't that light be travelling slower (at least from reference point 2's and our perspective) so that it takes longer than 1 year to reach point 2??? I know the light itself wouldn't 'experience' this slowdown, but to us on Earth, the light would appear to take longer than 3 years to get to us, right??? 

If this is the case, that the light doesn't slow from its own perspective, but from ours due to the higher gravity and slower 'time', how do we compensate for that in our readings of deep space? Also, is it possible that black holes actually let light pass through, but they just appear dark because it takes so long for the light to actually make it through (1 year black hole time = billions of years to us, or something to that effect?)

We have also reached the conclusion that the rate of expansion of the universe is accelerating.How can Hubble's Constant be called a ""constant"" if the expansion rate is increasing? I came up with a few hypotheses of my own:1. Two objects in space 1km apart will ""expand away"" from each other at a faster rate than two objects 500m apart. So, the rate of expansion of the universe is said to be accelerating simply because each reference point is being moved farther away from (nearly) all others, thus the rate of expansion between any two reference points appears to be increasing. In reality though, the space in 1 MPc still increases at a rate of 70km/s. This means Hubble's Constant is really ""constant"".2. The actual number of 70km/s/MPc is actually increasing over time (i.e., over 1 billion years it might be 80km/s/MPC), but it is increasing so slowly it is easier to refer it as a constant.

Growing up was great. Primary school was great (UK). My parents were amazing. When I reached secondary school my parents started to tell me to focus in school more, which I did. Everything was fine until I got to year 9 and started my GCSEs. My parents suddenly went from being these amazing caring people to being very cold and sometimes traumatic. 

They are Asian parents that immigrated here when I was around 2 so they have no idea how schools work. My dad told me that when grew up in Kurdistan, his education system was based off averages. If you got over 90% in every subject, you go to medical school. Over 80%, engineering. Under 80% and you can go and study to be a teacher. A broken system. 

They thought it was the same here even though I told them it wasn't. They wanted me to strive for medicine because of numerous family members also doing that. Competition within the family. I had never been sure on what I wanted to do when I grew up so the naïve 13 year old me agreed after they told my how much a doctor could earn. 

Soon after that, my dad was made redundant from a high paying job and was unemployed for around a year. This meant he was home 24/7. Anytime he saw me not revising, he'd call me ""useless"" or something similar. My mom was even worse. I don't recall being called ""Son"" or being praised by either of them in the past 5 years. I remember them trying to get me to revise for non existent exams during the summer holidays and refusing to talk to me when I proved them wrong. 

I wasn't aloud out. Ever. When I made plans, I asked for permission a week in advance and they'd say yes. Then the night before they say I can't. Every time I asked why, they commented on my behaviour even though I'm generally the quietest out of my siblings. When I brought this up they'd simply refuse to answer or say ""no backchatting.""

Fast forward to around the end of year 10. I researched and found a plethora of careers I'd love to get into, all maths related. When I told my parents, they'd go mad. ""A shame to the family"" and ""complete failure"" were just 2 of the things they'd called me. I got scared and decided to shut the fuck up.

Then I got into year 11. This was a year of constant hell. My dad got a night job that paid enough for us to live on and save a small amount every month. My mom didn't like this job and this caused arguments and resentment between the two of them constantly. I'd leave for school in the morning while they were arguing to come home from school to some other argument. All these arguments were over really small and dumb shit. But it was stressful. My siblings (13F and 5M) didn't pay attention to them. I wish I did the same as them. I was brought into arguments all the time and then had everything pinned on me even though I had nothing to do with what they were arguing about. This happened day in, day out for around 6 months. 

Then came exam season. Even with the arguments continuing, I tried my best to study. My mom had become lazy and simply slept in every day. This meant I was responsible to wake my siblings up, made sure they were ready and fed before school. I was stressed to the point of me being sleep deprived. Every day, it became harder and harder to pretend to be happy at school. I finally got my parents to sit and talk. I told them everything I had been going through, and they didn't care. ""You have to learn to be responsible."" No, you can't just shift your responsibility on me. 

I then told them that I was sure of not wanting to do medicine. Big mistake. They went batshit insane. They called me every word they could think of. Then they worried about what the rest of the family will think and how bad they'd look as parents if I did anything other than medicine. I've seen distant members of my family. I've seen how depressed they are knowing that their parents have forced this shit on them. 

My mom wanted to do whatever it took to keep me from making this decision. She threatened to disown me and to top it off, the crazy bitch threatened suicide if I didn't go to medical school. It's an empty threat and she knew I could tell. 

So she started to turn my siblings on me. While I'm revising, my sister would randomly walk into my room and call me dumb or a failure. 

Going through that shit with my sister and my mom and my dad every day while stressed to extreme levels hurt me like nothing else. I went to sleep crying. The ""sleep"" was around 4 hours long with me waking up a few times. 

After I finished my exams we moved cities. We moved around 150 miles to London. To get back to my city, we had to drive or catch a train. 

It was results day last week. I went back to school by train and got 4As, 2Bs and 4Cs. I was happy with them. My mom wasn't. She was expecting straight a*s. On the phone, while my best friends were in the same room as me, she started swearing. That meant I got to spend a 3 hour journey back dreading going into my home. When I got home, she went mad. I just ignored her and went into my room and closed the door while listening to her shouting on the other side. 

At that point, I cracked. I stopped being a kid who was too scared to make his own decisions. I can't wait for two years time. I can't wait for when my A levels are over and I can simply leave. I can't wait for the inevitable disowning. I can't wait to leave them and never come back. I can't fucking wait.

With the current focus on Ebola, I've struggled to understand why healthcare workers are consistently exposed to needlestick injuries when evaluating patients with the disease.  Per the CDC, the [preferred sample is 4ml of whole blood](http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/pdf/ebola-lab-guidance.pdf). This is consistent with other guidance from the WHO and MSF.  This obviously requires the use of butterfly needles/vacutainers to obtain a sample which is more dangerous (in my opinion) than using a [safety lancet](http://www.mountainside-medical.com/media/catalog/product/s/a/safety_lancets_safe_t_lance__86391.jpg) to obtain capillary blood. 

Is there a reason why we need (a) this quantity of blood and (b) why couldn't we use capillary blood using [a microtainer - PDF link](http://www.bd.com/vacutainer/pdfs/microtainer_tubes_vdp40093.pdf)  for testing? 

The reason why I get confused is for the following reasons: 

* We can already do ELISA testing for [HIV](http://www.orasure.com/products-infectious/products-infectious-oraquick.asp) and [HCV](http://www.orasure.com/products-infectious/products-infectious-oraquick-hcv.asp) using even smaller amounts of capillary blood. 
* Acute infections are assessed with a RT-PCR assay - surely the amplification step would provide evidence of viral infection even with small amounts of blood collected?

Ionizing atoms does not change the nuclear makeup.

BUT! It got me thinking... is it conceivable that sub-stellar rocky objects like small moons and large asteroids could impact each other with enough kinetic energy to cause small amounts of nuclear reactions at the impact site, possibly transmuting new elements or isotopes?  My original gut feeling was that it's not possible, given the prevalence of iron and other high-Z elements you'd find in rocky material like that, and I didn't think they'd be favorable towards fusing.  In addition, I'm inclined to think the typical velocities (10-100km/s?) and masses involved in solar-system-level collisions like this, even between large bodies, just can't quite reach the millions of degrees Kelvin and immense pressure to stimulate nuclear reactions, but I'm not certain.

Obviously, in principle, this process *should* be possible.  If you could magically accelerate, say, Comet 67P to 90% c and hit some else of similar size, I imagine you'd get all sorts of fun nuclear action.  In reality, though, I imagine it's exceedingly rare to find massive objects moving at relativistic speeds, save for exotic and extreme events involving black holes and/or supernovae.

Is there a way to model this to figure out what kind of conditions I would need to cause fusion?  I'm reminded of [what if? #1](http://what-if.xkcd.com/1/) and the fusion-inducing baseball pitch.

The reason I ask is because on the first page of the r/science there is an article about a fortuitous circumstance of hubble being able to capture evidence of a supernova while it is happening. So I got to wondering if it would be possible to pre-empt the event. I also know that the rate at which light propagates through matter is less than through a vacuum and that space is not actually a vacuum. I also know that there are a pair of satellites that are designed to detect gravity waves, which presumably don't have the same issues travelling through matter.

Basically, I'm wondering if it would be possible to use gravity waves to get a slight jump on a supernova or other such event. If the discrepancy in time of arrival is even 1 ms over 100,000 light-years that would be enough.

It would have the added benefit of being able to give a pretty good idea of what the distance to the object is (the difference in time between the light and gravity waves, combined with absorption spectra to give you the distribution of matter along the path should be able to tell you).

What I think from what I've read is that in electron degeneracy pressure the star compresses only enough until the electrons refuse to get any closer and hold the star as a white dwarf.  Does this mean the electrons are all squished together and are actually touching?  If so does that mean in neutron degeneracy that the electrons are compressed inside one another?  How does this support system provide energy and light?  How does it collapse compared to the regular collapse of a star that's used up it's fuel and why can the star remain in this state so much longer than the regular star can before collapsing?

For those who don't know, cyberpunk is a genre of science fiction which typically pertains to dystopian futures run by multinational corporations, but at core feature cybernetic enhancements or revolve around the growing relationship between man and machine (corporate espionage invloving data, virtual reality matrices, cyborg hitmen, etc). Its 80's sci fi predominantly,  so a lot of it has actually come to pass already.

I have a pretty optimistic view about the future when it comes to prosthetics and the neural interfacing required to make them function. 

What I am very curious about is the feasibility of the SENSORY interfacing that would enable a person to experience full virtual reality directly from machine to brain. See, in cyberpunk,  they had these things called ""datajacks"" which were typically fiber optic ports on your neck or head that connected directly to a device on your brain, which when stimulated took over your senses and displayed the ""matrix"". The person typically either
 a) ""willed"" themself through the net with commands driven by thoughts or
 b) maintained limited motor functions and used a keyboard by touch alone

Is it feasible to have a setup wired to brain feeding information to and fro from a 5 senses standpoint? Are we within sight of being able to simulate senses such as pain, pleasure, or hot or cold?

Dont worry about the logistical nightmare establishing something like a virtual reality matrix. I just want to know if it's something we could work towards in the not-too-distant future (as I do believe it to be possible at this point).

First off, a little background. I'm 33. When I was in my 20's RedBull was the big thing. I used to drink many of them (probably 5-8) a day. After about 3 years of constant consumption I gave up on the energy drink phase. By that time Monster had come around and a bunch of different kinds. But I had no desire to drink them anymore.

Anywho, cut to about 2 years ago I start working at a ""health food store"" that sold ""natural energy drinks"". There are two brands in particular I drink often, Blue Energy and Guru. I typically will have one of these before I start work, and maybe one mid shift, depending on how busy I've been. When I'm at work, these suckers get me wired and ready to go. My only problem is that if I have one when I'm not at work my body almost immediately goes into shutdown, ""must nap"" mode.

So I guess my question is strange. Am I having these problems because of how many I drank when I was younger and something is physiologically happening to me, or is it because I am getting older and my body is reacting in peculiar ways and is there a scientific reason for it?? Or is it all psychologically induced reason for it reacting on me in certain ways in certain atmospheres and environments??

The power source is a lithium chemistry battery  with a nominal voltage of 3.7v, and at full capacity an open circuit voltage of 4.25v. The exact chemistry is lithium ion manganese oxide, if that helps narrow it down, and I'm working with 18650 and 26650 format cells.

When the switch is closed, the battery's voltage drops about 0.3-0.4v, so let's assume the cell reads 3.8v across the terminals under load.

Others (e.g. [NOAA's GFDL](http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/global-warming-and-hurricanes)) consider such a declaration premature, even for the Atlantic basin, but mention an expected trend of an increased global proportion of intense hurricanes that mayn't be detectable until past 2050, and potentially accompanied by a possible global decrease in number of tropical storms.  The GFDL page also mentions expectations of higher rainfall associated with storms.  Another recent paper ([Kossin et al. 2014](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v509/n7500/full/nature13278.html)) entitled ""The poleward migration of the location of tropical cyclone maximum intensity"" documents, well, what the title indicates and mentions the potential role of anthropogenic contributions.  However, searching for information online (I don't have access to most peer-reviewed literature) about whether hurricanes are changing / will change in some predictable way in the future yields blogs and websites full of amateur speculation,  websites with agendas / clear biases, and less-than-robust inference / dubious statistics.

His explanation being (my paraphrasing) they sacrifice human understanding of programs at the lowest level for the resource optimization requirements of the 50s that don't affect us today. Specifically the desire to reduce the number of gates (or tubes) for cost purposes. He argues that because 2's compliment is prone to over-run and binary floats are prone to rounding errors when converting to decimal that it would be better to implement a single number type, decimal float, that would ""optimize for the humans"". The discussion in the interview begins at time 41:30.

I infer from his statements that he believes we can implement this change (let's ignore for now the legacy support problem) in our circuitry without ill effects. Presumably without any performance loss. 

Is he full of it? Can we implement decimal number types without noticeably increasing the number of switches required to perform a single operation? I assumed since it's what I was taught, that at this point these types are highly speed-optimized. That is was hardware manufacturers care about after all: speed, cost, and power consumption. Possibly we can afford the extra gates (my laptop has several billion transistors after all), but can we afford the extra time and power consumed per operation?

It looked so cheesy. When I see 90's television today, it's in a different aspect ratio but the quality does not look that bad. (I'm assuming digitizing video must have started in the 90's?) but episodes of the Simpsons look awful. And I don't remember them looking that awful.

Now as for photographs, I know that my photographs have deteriorated over the years because the colors are more dull and less vibrant and I am almost sure they didn't always look like this.  But I guess I could be wrong. 

I also recently saw news footage from 9/11. It also had that dated look like it was shot in the 80's. (my reference point for awful video)

Did the video really look like this or is it tape/film deterioration and time? If the videos and film have indeed always looked like this is it my eyes which now see them as less vibrant and less colorful because I am now used to higher resolution video?

I see most driver do this... the dis-obey traffic laws where they should stop, but do not take advantage of traffic laws where they do not have to stop or should not stop.

A ***tldr*** of the article: Woman gets lost in snow. Falls into a tree well and is unconscious. This occurs at 2:00 AM. At 9:30 AM a team finds her. No pulse, no breathing. Cold body, no signs of life. They preform CPR and mouth-to-mouth ventilation for 4 hours. She is successfully revived. 

To my knowledge, ventilation supplies oxygen (a relatively small amount when given from the breath of another person) to the lungs, which oxygenate the blood. CPR manually stimulates the heart to pump blood (oxygenated by ventilation) throughout the body and the brain. Without oxygenated blood, the brain will eventually die - with many reports stating brain injury at 3-4 minutes without oxygen. 

This woman was presumably dead for 7 hours, then worked on for another 4 hours before she showed signs of life. The article spoke of hypothermia allowing her body to be revived. Hypothermia would slow your heart rate and breathing immensely in order to keep you alive - so much so that a pulse or a breath would be easy to miss. But eventually, won't your body still not be getting enough of the required oxygen to prevent brain injury/death? Especially for 11 hours?

When phosphorus in the sewage was identified as the limiting factor causing the algal blooms, treatment plants were installed for the sewage and the water quality improved and surpassed initial measurements.

A similar example in the gulf of Mexico is a result of nitrogen fertilizers running off the Mississippi watershed and causing a huge deadzone in the Mississippi river delta.

I asked my professor what it was that made them dependent on different elements but he wasn't sure. I don't have a background in chemistry or biology so I was hoping someone could help me out!

The specific question stems from [Dr. Harold ""Sonny"" White's paper](http://doczine.com/bigdata/1/1385630202_9456562b4d/davis_staif_conference_2.pdf) (warning: PDF) and the third equation in that paper:

T^00 = -(c^(4)/(8*&amp;pi;*G))(v^(2)&amp;rho;^(2)/(4r^(2)c^(2)))(df/dr)^2

Where:

* c is the speed of light
* G is the gravitational constant
* v is the ""speed"" of the warp bubble along its travel vector
* &amp;rho; is the square root of the sum of the non-travel-vector coordinates y and z (x being the travel vector)
* r is the radial position in the commoving spherical space around the spacecraft's origin, determined by sqrt( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )

That aside, it's often said that a warp drive using these principles would require tremendous amounts of energy (negative energy at that, but let's table that particular aspect for this conversation) -- **how is that calculated from the above?** What's the next mathematical step? 

Further, **is this energy a one-time expenditure**, such that the warped spacetime is established and then remains, or is it something that must be expended continuously (representing, perhaps, the per-second energy expenditure)?

I was wondering: Why don't we have a better way of determining what a kilogram is? The kilogram is still based on a physical object.

We now define 1 meter as the distance light travels in a certain amount of seconds. First there was a wooden and later a metal bar and that was the definition of a meter. They found the speed (m/s) of light, and later defined the meter with the speed of light as the distance travelled by light in a certain amount of time. So they used the constant to define the constant, in a way. 

So now I was wondering, why does this not happen for mass. We still base mass on the physical kilogram (that is stored somewhere in France I believe?). But we have defined the mass of electrons and protons and neutrons in kilograms. (1 proton = 1.67262*10-27 kg at rest).

And the protons and neurtrons are found in the middle of this structure? or is there an area of probability where you will find the protons and neutrons as well?

To my question, how correct is this way of visualizing atoms, as shown in the first image of the structure of water?

&gt;The Sour Sop or the fruit from the graviola
&gt;
&gt;tree is a miraculous natural cancer cell killer 10,000 times stronger than Chemo.
&gt;
&gt;Why are we not aware of this? Its because some big corporation want to make back their money spent on years of research by trying to make a synthetic version of it for
&gt;
&gt;sale.So, since you know it now you can help a friend in need by letting him know or just drink some sour sop juice yourself as prevention from time to time. The taste is not bad after all. It’s completely natural and definitely has no side effects. If you have the space, plant one in your garden.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The other parts of the tree are also useful.
&gt;
&gt;The next time you have a fruit juice, ask for a sour sop.
&gt;
&gt;How many people died in vain while this billion-dollar drug maker concealed the secret of the miraculous Graviola tree?
&gt;
&gt;This tree is low and is called graviola ! in Brazi l, guanabana in Spanish and has the uninspiring name “soursop” in English. The fruit is very large and the subacid sweet white pulp is eaten out of hand or, more commonly, used to make fruit drinks, sherbets and such.
&gt;
&gt;The principal interest in this plant is because of its strong anti-cancer effects. Although it is effective for a number of medical conditions, it is its anti tumor effect that is of most interest. This plant is a proven cancer remedy for cancers of all types.
&gt;
&gt;Besides being a cancer remedy, graviola is a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent for both bacterial and fungal infections, is effective against internal parasites and worms, lowers high blood pressure and is used for depression, stress and nervous disorders.
&gt;
&gt;If there ever was a single example that makes it dramatically clear why the existence of Health Sciences Institute is so vital to Americans like you, it’s the incredible story behind the Graviola tree..
&gt;
&gt;The truth is stunningly simple: Deep within the Amazon Rainforest grows a tree that could literally revolutionize what you, your doctor, and the rest of the world thinks about cancer treatment and chances of survival. The future has never looked more promising.
&gt;
&gt;Research shows that with extracts from this miraculous tree it now may be possible to:
&gt;
&gt;Attack cancer safely and effectively with an all-natural therapy that does not cause extreme nausea, weight loss and hair loss
&gt;Protect your immune system and avoid deadly infections
&gt;Feel stronger and healthier throughout the course of the treatment
&gt;Boost your energy and improve your outlook on life
&gt;
&gt;The source of this information is just as stunning: It comes from one of America ‘s largest drug manufacturers, th! e fruit of over 20 laboratory tests conducted since the 1970's! What those tests revealed was nothing short of mind numbing… Extracts from the tree were shown to:
&gt;
&gt;Effectively target and kill malignant cells in 12 types of cancer, including colon, breast, prostate, lung and pancreatic cancer..
&gt;The tree compounds proved to be up to 10,000 times stronger in slowing the growth of cancer cells than Adriamycin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug!
&gt;What’s more, unlike chemotherapy, the compound extracted from the Graviola tree selectivelyhunts
&gt;
&gt;down and kills only cancer cells.. It does not harm healthy cells!
&gt;
&gt;The amazing anti-cancer properties of the Graviola tree have been extensively researched–so why haven’t you heard anything about it? If Graviola extract is
&gt;
&gt;One of America ‘s biggest billion-dollar drug makers began a search for a cancer cure and their research centered on Graviola, a legendary healing tree from the Amazon Rainforest.
&gt;
&gt;Various parts of the Graviola tree–including the bark, leaves, roots, fruit and fruit-seeds–have been used for centuries by medicine men and native Indi! ans in S outh America to treat heart disease, asthma, liver problems and arthritis. Going on very little documented scientific evidence, the company poured money and resources into testing the tree’s anti-cancerous properties–and were shocked by the results. Graviola proved itself to be a cancer-killing dynamo.
&gt;But that’s where the Graviola story nearly ended.
&gt;
&gt;The company had one huge problem with the Graviola tree–it’s completely natural, and so, under federal law, not patentable. There’s no way to make serious profits from it.
&gt;
&gt;It turns out the drug company invested nearly seven years trying to synthesize two of the Graviola tree’s most powerful anti-cancer ingredients. If they could isolate and produce man-made clones of what makes the Graviola so potent, they’d be able to patent it and make their money back. Alas, they hit a brick wall. The original simply could not be replicated. There was no way the company could protect its profits–or even make back the millions it poured into research.
&gt;
&gt;As the dream of huge profits evaporated, their testing on Graviola came to a screeching halt. Even worse, the company shelved the entire project and chose not to publish the findings of its research!
&gt;
&gt;Luckily, however, there was one scientist from the Graviola research team whose conscience wouldn’t let him see such atrocity committed. Risking his career, he contacted a company that’s dedicated to harvesting medical plants from the Amazon Rainforest and blew the whistle.
&gt;
&gt;Miracle unleashed
&gt;When researchers at the Health Sciences Institute were alerted to the news of Graviola,! they be gan tracking the research done on the cancer-killing tree. Evidence of the astounding effectiveness of Graviola–and its shocking cover-up–came in fast and furious….
&gt;
&gt;The National Cancer Institute performed the first scientific research in 1976. The results showed that Graviola’s “leaves and stems were found effective in attacking and destroying malignant cells.” Inexplicably, the results were published in an internal report and never released to the public…
&gt;Since 1976, Graviola has proven to be an immensely potent cancer killer in 20 independent laboratory tests, yet no double-blind clinical trials–the typical benchmark mainstream doctors and journals use to judge a treatment’s value–were ever initiated….
&gt;A study published in the Journal of Natural Products, following a recent study conducted at Catholic University of South Korea stated that one chemical in Graviola was found to selectively kill colon cancer cells at “10,000 times the potency of (the commonly used chemotherapy drug) Adriamycin…”
&gt;The most significant part of the Catholic University of South Korea report is that Graviola was shown to selectively target the cancer cells, leaving healthy cells untouched. Unlike chemotherapy, which indiscriminately targets all actively reproducing cells (such as stomach and hair cells), causing the often devastating side effects of nausea and hair loss in cancer patients.
&gt;A study at Purdue University recently found that leaves from the Graviola tree killed cancer cells among six human cell lines and were especially effective against prostate, pancreatic and lung cancers Seven years of silence broken–i

&gt; According to Alessio Fasano, the Medical Director for The University
&gt; of Maryland's Center for Celiac Research, no one can properly digest
&gt; gluten.
&gt; 
&gt; ""We do not have the enzymes to break it down,"" he said in a recent
&gt; interview with TenderFoodie. ""It all depends upon how well our
&gt; intestinal walls close after we ingest it and how our immune system
&gt; reacts to it."" His concern is that the gluten protein, which is
&gt; abundant in the endosperm of barley, rye, and wheat kernels, is
&gt; setting off an aberrant immune response.

I am not an expert in the matter, but my understanding is that the very etiology of celiac involves the breakdown of gluten (specifically the gliadin) by tissue transglutaminase, which is definitely an enzyme*. 

&gt; [However][2], in some instances, TG2 can react with water in preference over an amine, leading to the deamidation of glutamine residues. 118,119 Gluten proteins, the immunological trigger of gluten sensitivity, are glutamine-rich donor substrates amenable to deamidation. TG2 contributes to disease development in at least two ways: ﬁ rst, by deamidating gluten peptides and thereby increasing their aﬃ nity for HLA-DQ2/DQ8, which potentiates the T-cell response, 120,121 and, second, by haptenisation of self-antigens through crosslinking with gliadins. 122 This latter activity has been implicated in autoantibody development (ﬁ gure 4). Activation of TG2 and deamidation of gluten peptides seems to be central to disease development and is now well understood at a molecular level. 

In fact, it's my understanding that testing for celiac often involves looking for those Anti-transglutaminase antibodies. So it's an enzyme that normally breaks down gluten and the process has gone haywire. If we have an enzyme able to do this, wouldn't that allow normal people to break down gluten? Am I misunderstanding things? 

I do find info that gluten tends to be hard for the human digestive system to break down**

&gt; [Because][3] human gastric and pancreatic enzymes lack postproline cleaving
&gt; activity, the abundance of proline residues in gluten renders it
&gt; highly resistant to complete proteolytic degradation in the human
&gt; gastrointestinal tract, a feature that is most likely linked to the
&gt; disease-inducing properties of gluten.

But no evidence that this has negative effects on healthy people since most plant foods contain things we can't break down

1) If I hit a hammer to the ground, what will the energy spectrum look like (what frequencies will have energy) as a function of the relevant hit parameters (i.e. duration etc.).

2) Background: A real experiment I conducted -
I have an automatic hammer that hits for a duration of about 0.1 seconds.
I used it on the ground and measured the signal with a geophone.
I performed a Fourier transform on the signal and the energy is spread in the range of ~ 20-100 Hz. No energy what so ever under 15Hz.

If I used this hammer at a frequency of 5Hz (5 hits on the ground every second), will the signal carry energy in 5Hz?
My intuition says it will, but math says it won't (because if the signal of one hit is s(t), then the signal of the repeated hit will be [s(t) conv comb(t)]. Fourier transform for this will give S(f) * comb(f). meaning it can't carry energy in any frequency the original signal didn't have energy in.

What is wrong with my intuition? or with my math?

Essentially I have pictures that I've done some math do, and at this point they're all stored as matrices where each element can have values -1, 0, or -1.

Over all the images, I'm taking an average (and some other statistical data) to come up with an average image. I'm also taking an average that ignores 0 values (unless the average of all the -1's and +1's comes out to zero). For these images, a value of zero meant that there was no flame present at that pixel, -1 and +1 were different kinds of flames.

I know that there are some symbols for average values, and I'm trying to find a symbol to represent the averaging where I ignore 0 values.

At the moment, I'm using &lt;X&gt; for the average value of X (X is the value of a pixel), and &lt;X|B=0&gt; as that average ignoring zero values, (where B is the probability for a given pixel that it's value will be 0. A is the probability that it's -1, and C is the probability that it's +1).

Would this be an appropriate way to convey the averaging?

First off, why do we assume that all/most of the earth's dry land was all clumped together at the same time? This might be a pretty elementary question, but most of what has been explained to me just seems to indicate that, at one time or another, many parts were connected (fossil records/shape/rain forests of Africa and S. America, for example). Why do we assume that all were connected at the same time, though? Would a theory providing support to the idea that they might not have all been one gigantic body at once be credible, or is Pangaea pretty much the prevailing theory? (e.g. evolution in the biology field).

Second, why did all of the dry land seem to come together in one spot? Is this especially likely or was it just a coincidence? Were there noteworthy patches of other dry land? My two points of confusion here are that it seems unlikely (as someone who knows nothing at all about the field) that the vast majority of the highly elevated earth would be in the same spot, and that a lot of noteworthy islands don't seem to be separated continents, but created by volcanic activity.

RECOGNIZING A STROKE
Thank God for the sense to remember the '3' steps, STR. Read and
Learn!
Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. Unfortunately, the lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke victim may suffer severe brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke.
Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three simple questions:

&gt;S *Ask the individual to SMILE.

&gt;T *Ask the person to TALK and SPEAK A
SIMPLE SENTENCE (Coherently)
(i.e. Chicken Soup)

&gt;R *Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS.

&gt;If he or she has trouble with ANY ONE of these tasks, call emergency number immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher.

NOTE: Another 'sign' of a stroke is this: Ask the person to 'stick' out his tongue. If the tongue is
'crooked', if it goes to one side or the other that is also an indication of a stroke.

Parents just refilled their ~400 gallon hot tub and were hoping to use it later in the evening.  The only data point we had was that in the first hour it went from ~60*F to ~65*F.

Simple question -- the water is refilled in a hot tub, and comes out of the hose at a relatively low temperature (60*F for this example).  The desired temperature is 100*F, is the heating of the hot tub linear, or is there some scaling function involved at the start of the process or when the temperature nears desired temp?

My mom thinks the first few degrees are the ""hardest"", and after that it gets easier.  My dad and I both think it is linear, and if anything gets more difficult to heat at the higher temperatures given the (delta)T with the ambient air this time of year (40's and 50's F).

So the SI system of units has seven base units: the meter, the kilogram, the second, the ampere, the kelvin, the mole, and the candela.

But what if we were to define two new base units called the ""mperk"", equal to one meter per kilogram, and the ""mtimesk"", equal to one meter times one kilogram? If I'm understanding things correctly, we could just as well go about using {mperk, mtimesk, s, A, K, mol, cd} as the base units of a new system of units, right? So, for example, a joule would be mtimesk^2 second^(-1) rather than m^2 kg^2 s^(-1). 

(Also: is it correct or appropriate to think of the 7 SI base units as ""spanning"" a vector space of some sort? If so, then we could conceptualize the transformation from {m, kg} -&gt; {mperk, mtimesk} as basically changing bases.)

**Given that we *can* do this, *why* do we not do so?** Is the SI system of units in some sense a ""natural"" system of units? Does using SI just make doing physics easier? Or is it just a historical accident that we've defined the units the way we have?

(I'm not asking why e.g. we define the second in terms of the hyperfine transition in Cs-133, or why we use a decimalized system - obviously, we need to define the *values* of the units somehow [and I guess those definitions are almost surely matters of historical accident], and decimalization is quite clearly a convenient way of doing things. I'm only really asking about the *dimensions* of the base units.)

---

Another question: **is it possible for us to define a system with more or fewer than 7 independent base units?** I guess I'm particularly interested in the case of the candela. I've never had to use a candela in 2.5 years as an undergraduate physics major thus far, and the definition of the candela seems kind of outrageous for a ""base unit"" insofar as it seems to be related to the luminosity function of the human eye. 

The mole also strikes me as a somewhat dubious unit, in the sense that it seems to only serve to define what is effectively a dimensionless scaling factor (Avogadro's number). Would we have any harder a time doing physics if we worked exclusively with particle number and did away with the notion of moles? It doesn't seem like we would.

And come to think of it, temperature, too. Temperature just seems less inherently physical than mass, length, time, and charge (or current, whatever). Is this true in any sense?

---

Aside: I've been thinking over this question for a while now, but what prompted me to post this was /u/bluecoconut's answer to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/12yy8e/what_stops_light_from_going_faster/), in which he mentioned that ""[c is defined] in such a way that that is how the two dimensions [distance and time] talk to each other."" So I guess I'm also curious **if the known physical constants like c cause us to favor one system of units over another because of how they allow different units to talk to one another.** (but then again, is {h, c} any more fundamental than {h\*c, h/c}? So I'm not sure if this final question is well-formed.)

---

EDIT: I'm also aware of the existence of ""naturalized"" systems of units in which e.g. one might set c, h, and G equal to 1, thus defining the meter, kilogram, and second by proxy.

My friend, a philosopher, reasons that most if not all the health risks are due to the smoke (burning died tobacco) or tobacco (chewing).  He says it's a logical argument to conclude that if you remove the smoke; that nicotine is ""fairly safe"" as long as taken in a pure form (like patches or gum).

The wiki states that ""Nicotine increases blood pressure and heart rate in humans"".  His counter argument for that is ""so does caffeine, but humans have been using it without harm for thousands of years"".

He says the benefits outweigh the risks [again, wiki, highlights his]

&gt; Nicotine's mood-altering effects are different by report: in particular it is both a stimulant and a relaxant.[44] First causing a release of glucose from the liver and epinephrine (adrenaline) from the adrenal medulla, it causes stimulation. Users report **feelings of relaxation, sharpness, calmness, and alertness.**[45] Like any stimulant, it may very rarely cause the often catastrophically uncomfortable neuropsychiatric effect of akathisia. By **reducing the appetite and raising the metabolism, some smokers may lose weight as a consequence**

**In the following example, for clarity, ignore the luminosity &amp; chromaticity of the aberration of light/radiation as experienced by the spacecraft.**

You are in a spacecraft that accelerates from say, a platform “at rest”, i.e. constant (subrelativistic) velocity in space.  

On the platform there is a frictionless rotating object, which is rotating at a constant, subrelativistic, (but obviously noticeable) velocity. 

Say, for example, two spheres of 100m diameter, connected by a 200m bar, mutually rotating about each other (the centrepoint of the bar), rotating at 100m/s as measured by the “circumference” traced out by the centres of the spheres. The platform simply represents zero changing velocity, as opposed to the velocity spheres.

**Question:**

**What is the physical behavior/appearance of the on-edge (towards/away) and across-sideways (right angle vector) velocities of the spheres under the (Lorentzian) contraction of space &amp; dilation of time, as viewed from the receding/approaching spacecraft at velocities tending towards and/or away from *c*?** 

Also, assume you have a telescope of infinite angular resolution so you can see the bloody thing at the stupid distances necessary….

I'd really like to discuss this and have any concerns someone might have (including me) put to rest if there is no similarity. Warning: long post.

The book [The Coming Global Superstorm](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_17?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=the+coming+global+superstorm&amp;sprefix=the+coming+global%2Caps%2C254) postulates the theory that climate change from global warming can result in gigantic, previously impossible storms that can be disastrous. Things like a storm that can cover an entire continent, or drop huge amounts of snow overnight.

The basic theory (filtered through my 13 year old recollection and layman's comprehension) goes like this: rising temperatures increase glacial runoff of cold water into the north Atlantic which shuts down or inhibits the [gulf stream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_stream) which is a current largely responsible for bringing warm water from the south to the north and doing things like keeping England and the east coast warmer.

This results in larger storms with crazy results up to and including negative air pressure so low and air so cold that it is basically chunks of space falling to the ground and freezing things instantly, or dropping unbelievable amounts of snow in a very short time, or the storm persisting for weeks or months or longer. To paraphrase the book: a given storm will persist until the conditions that create that storm abate.

Many of the comments I see about Sandy remark on how unprecedented it is. [This article/blog post](http://epawablogs.com/the-great-halloween-hybrid-named-sandy-2/) has quotes like: ""we were somewhat skeptical as to whether such an event could happen"". 

""This 'capturing' of Sandy by the trough will transition the storm from a tropical hurricane (which is a WARM core system with it’s highest winds and greatest rains near the center of the system) to a hybrid type or extratropical storm (or COLD core system, with winds and rain much more spread out). Additionally, this trough interaction will cause rapid deepening, meaning the pressure will fall quickly. This is important because as the pressure falls, the winds with the storm pick up, because of the pressure contrast with an area of higher pressure to its north.""

""her pressure has dropped to 932 mb, and the wind field has greatly expanded – sustained winds of greater than 45 miles per hour extend for over 1000 miles, while winds of greater than 65 mph, with gusts to 90 mph, extend for over 500 miles. Granted this is about a mile up in the atmosphere"".

""This setup is truly a historical, once in a hundred year event.""

""Because this storm will be so large, with such a massive windfield, the exact point at which the center crosses the coast won’t be as important...""

Or this from the [reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/1267bq/every_once_in_a_while_a_storm_comes_along_on_the/) about the article: ""Some computer models have this storm pegged at 935mb off the coast of Delaware on Monday, which would be the lowest pressure ever recorded in the Northeast Atlantic.""

Couple this with posts about [the skies turning purple](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1267qu/the_sky_was_purple_after_a_storm_in_wisconsin_a/) and other things it just seems like some really weird shit is going on.

I know some people have trouble accepting this has any legitimacy due to the source (including me) but I'm genuinely curious. I'd really appreciate it if anyone can provide more clarification, if there was some legitimate discussion, and if the post wasn't dismissed out of hand or deleted because someone just assumes it's ridiculous.

We are currently covering magnetic theory in my electrical engineering, and since my first year I have been quite curious and skeptical about the nature of energy in magnetic lines of flux.  The reason being, we have all these equations which work in regards to the flux, but we still do not understand the composition of it.  Of course, obviously the current theory is that the molocules align when a voltage is induced over the ferris ( or gasseus elements when ultra cooled according to New research) but the actual energy and composition of the energy is Unknown aside from formulas and the word ""magnetism"" attributed to it. But I have a theory for which to explain it, and please educate me and prove me wrong if there is something I am missing.  Sorry for non paragraph format, on a cell phone.    Now let's assume current magnetic Theory is correct....  The atoms align which create flux with an induced voltage,  now, magnetic lines of flux contain direction, but not motion.  ................. When a magnet is placed in conjunction with another magnet in a n s configuration, the lines of flux combine, and create a path from magnet 1 n to magnet 2 s.  They share the same field.  Now, with the alignment of these atoms, why can't the atomic electron orbitals also combine as the magnets do ( which shares similar polarization properties of repulsion and attraction).  If this were the case, there would be many directions in which these orbitals would combine, and the alignment forces them so sit in such a way that the orbitals combine and due to this there is less of an energy requirement to hold the electrons nearby ( which remain near their respective nucleus). They stop moving and the excess energy from the orbital field within the magnet is protruded outwards, not dissipated but stay in orbit around the entirety of the magnet, which is why they possess direction as the electrons cease movement but stay near their respective nucleus,  the direction is taken from that movement, which resumes when the flux collapses.

It works by interrupting power to the unit when the temperature inside falls below a specified level,  in this case 52 degrees. When the temp rises above 54 power is restored and cooling kicks back on. Anyway I had heard of people doing this with refrigerators but I went with a stand up freezer for a couple reasons. First,  there is no wasted space like a separate freezer section,  soda dispenser, vegetable drawers , etc; just a bunch of shelves inside. Secondly, the freezer works by circulating coolant throughout tubes on each shelf instead of using cold air like a standard fridge. I thought this would more effectively distribute the cold and I would avoid the low humidity problems associated with fridges. Ideal humidity is 70% for wine,  much more and the labels are likely to mold and/or fall off. Well, I'm getting **100%** and the top shelf is always dripping. I can wipe it down but it just comes back. I even tried putting desiccant in there in the form of a closet dehumidifier which helps the humidity of the air come down to the high 80's, but the top shelf is still dripping on my wine bottles below.

Now, while this is clearly idiotic, I wanted to judge the possibility of breaking your fall by swinging in a quarter circle from some point of height for the grappling hook.

Naturally there are some challenges with this. In order to attain the optimal position, the hook would have to grapple at full length, with no slack, to avoid a huge jerk. It would also have to be grappled at exactly a 45 degree angle to achieve the maximum amount of distribution of force.

But, if somehow we managed to achieve this, one would think that the massive amount of force that is acting on your body when hitting the ground at such a velocity would be distributed along the curve that the body takes. 

My question is this, what amount of force would be acting on your arm(s) as you go through the curve and shoot out horizontally, and could human arms withstand that force? Could the rope withstand it?

Obviously there is the issue of what to do once you have a horizontal velocity of a lot, but that is a completely different question.

On a BHI they were small golden/yellow colored colonies.
I also did a DNAse test, which was also positive. 
On an antibiogram test I saw resistance for Deferoxamin and the bacteria was sensitive for Novobiocin. I could see an inhibition zone with Oxacillin, but there were a couple colonies that were still growing in that zone, so it was also resistant for this one.
So I would have probably decided that these bacteria were S. aureus.
But then I took a look under the microscope, and I could only see Streptococs and gram negative bacteria. So my question for you guys is: Are there any gram negative bacteria or Streptococs that test positive for protein A?

The book then went on to say that the reason the walls collapsed is due to what Science now understands as playing a 'sound' at the same resonant frequency to the material(s) the walls were made of.

I did some further research at the time and found an article (sorry, no link. This was many years ago) that mentioned a similar device was made and tested during the cold war but on a smaller scale (ie. a 'gun' that would resonate at the same frequency to [some?] internal organs and make the person being 'fired' at very queezy and sick so long a the gun was active. Once firing stopped the person would recover).
I also remember a story [I read online] about some occupants of a building complaining about stomach cramps/pains and upon investigation it was found that the air-conditioning was acting up and this was causing the air-con ducts to vibrate at a certain frequency and cause the unpleasant feeling.

Is it possible to cause apparently solid matter (walls etc...) to collapse or vibrate using such a device? Would the device need to be larger the more 'solid' or larger the object you want to affect is?

This is particularly noticeable in South America, where it began with a positive (more than average) gravity, and then ended up having less than average gravity after a few months.

Now the further away the moon is, the larger the linear velocity. It shouldn't be too hard to have the linear velocity be greater than c. Can this happen? Why or Why not?

*PS: a student asked me this. I said I thought that the beam would move sideways at v &gt; c, but since the photons are not moving sideways, each photon is moving in a radial direction, that there is nothing physical moving faster than c, so relativity is not violated.

Here are some calculations just to illustrate what I mean. If it doesn't work with the moon, then aim it at the sun (which is farther away) but has the same angular diameter.

    distance to moon:  384,400,000 m
    diameter: 3,500,000 m
    angular diameter: 0.5 degrees

angular velocity w = q/t (where q = theta).  How long does it take to move a laser 0.5 degrees? Lets say 90 degrees/second - it it were mounted on something quite stable, it could be done - the laser (or rather the mirror that the laser points at) would complete one rotation in 4 seconds.

    w = q/t = 90 degrees/sec = 1.57 red/sec
    v = w * r
       = 1.57rad/s * 3.84 x 10^8 m

This is easy.  All we need is the velocity of the ship, the speed of light and the amount of ""subjective time"" the ship was traveling (the amount of time the crew perceives).  

So, if a ship were to travel at .99c for, say, 150 years ""subjective time"" (crew time), they would arrive at their destination 1,063 and change years later in ""objective time"" (Earth time).

My question is how does this work for an accelerating object.  Imagine a ship launches from Earth in a given year, let's call it year 0, accelerates at constant thrust of 9.81 m/s/s (one ""gee"") for half the trip, turns around and decelerates at an identical speed and stops there.  The total trip time, just like the above ship, is 150 years.

I know these equations get tough quickly, but if we assume a constant acceleration, how long will it take the ship to reach .99c? I tried to look that up, but it seems to require more math than I have.  I think it should be considerably less than 1 year though, right?  The only way I thought to figure it is (((.99c/9.81)60)/60)/24) which gave me about 350 days.  I know that's wrong because acceleration compounds, so it should be a hell of a lot *faster*, right?

And if the acceleration remains constant, if the ship accelerated for, to give an example, 100 years, how close would the speed be to the speed of light?

In other words, can the above equation, t=t0/(1-v^2 /c^2 )^1/2  even be used at all if the ship is accelerating?  Does the acceleration really matter that much after the first few years when the ship is at .99999999999c?  How different would the calculations be if you took the actual acceleration into account, rather than just assumed the ship was traveling at .999999999c for the entire trip?  

If the equation above isn't useful for an accelerating object, how would one go about figuring up the objective time (Earth time) for a ship under those circumstances?

Second question:  Imagine a second, exactly identical ship leaves exactly 5 years after the first and accelerates and decelerates in an identical manner.  Would it arrive exactly 5 years after the first?  In other words, if the first traveled 2000 years ""objective"" time, would the second do exactly the same and just be five years behind the first?  (arriving 2005 years after the first ship left)?

That is, will mass ""a"" have energy ""b"" Joules regardless of where I observe it from. To this, he replied yes.

Now, consider mass x (100kg) is moving through a vacum in a straight line at  a constant speed of 1x10^8 m/s, parallel to z who is also moving at 1x10^8 m/s [(see diagram for a clearer picture)](http://imgur.com/9HN3c). The distance between x and z is constant, so we may assume that x is at rest relative to z. However, relative to y, z is moving at 1x10^8 m/s.

Ek =1/2 x m x v^2, so x's kinetic energy relative to point y = 5x10^7J BUT, as far as I can see, x's kinetic energy relative to point z is 0J because from z, x's v = 0m/s.

Again, I approached my teachers on the matter, and they told me that energy is conserved and invariant, but the type of energy mass x has changes depending on where you observe it from.
I then investigated the energies of x relative to y and z using E=mc^2.

*x's energy relative to y*

E=(relativistic mass)c^2

=100kg/ squareroot(1 - 1x10^16/9x10^16) x c^2
=106.066c^2 J


*x's energy relative to z*

E=mc^2

=(rest mass, 100kg) x c^2
=100c^2 J


I cannot make left or right of this. Does this mean that energy is in fact not an invariant quantity? Could someone explain where the difference in energy arises, and why it appears that energy is not conserved?

**What are the results?**

[Eric Lander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Lander) characterizes ENCODE as the successor to the [Human Genome Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project): where the genome project simply gave us an assembled sequence of all the letters of the genome, ""like getting a picture of Earth from space"", ""it doesn’t tell you where the roads are, it doesn’t tell you what traffic is like at what time of the day, it doesn’t tell you where the good restaurants are, or the hospitals or the cities or the rivers."" In contrast, ENCODE is more like Google Maps: a layer of functional annotations on top of the basic geography.

After a whole day trying to figure how the permittivity is related to the conductivity of a material (a few books later I am now convinced some people fake understanding it or can't address it properly or I am stupid as stupid gets..which is probable) I came to the conclusions that the permittivity in the presence of free carriers (or else there is no conductivity) is just some kind of convention/analogy with the bound charge case (very often mentioned) and is given by this [expression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_medium#Lossy_medium) \espilon= epsilon_0 + (i*\sigma)/\omega where \epsilon is the permittivity, \sigma is the conductivity, i is the imaginary unit and \omega = 2 *\pi * frequency 


So this real part of the complex permittivity in the presence free carriers is often replaced by the ""high frequency limit of the permittivity"" which makes some kind of sense for it is the remaning component when \omega goes to infinity. My problem is the following : It is also sometimes referred to as ""permittivity due to bound charges"" which, to me, sounds like a DC limit.. ""why?"" you ask. Because for higher frequencies things start to get complicated, you get absorption for instance. For DC, I would expect matter to behave ""linearly"". I cannot understand why we have to work with this high frequency limit when the value usually found is the static limit of the permittivity. For example, the silicon has a static permittivity value of around 11.7 which, converted to the refractive index, gives around 3.4 (\sqrt(11.7)) which is indeed the DC limit you find [here](http://www.ioffe.ru/SVA/NSM/Semicond/Si/Figs/141.gif)



My question would be : how is this ""high frequency limit permittivity"" related to the DC permittivity limit?


I guess I'm wrong but I am honestly confused and the explanations I get from different books for the existance of permittivity in the case of free carriers are confusing me.


Thank you very much for taking the time to read this.

**EDIT**

My other guess is that there exists a frequency \omega_i for which free carriers cannot absorb electric field due to it's ""high frequency"" but at which ""bound charge"" effects still exist and are the only one measurable. This would explain why ""high frequency"" is related to ""bound charges"" but is stil DC in contrast to the electromagnetic spectrum.... a ""high frequency"" relative to the electronic world more than to the optic world. 

Yeah.... I'm desperate...

**EDIT #2**

I have found the [following pdf](http://www.nist.gov/data/PDFfiles/jpcrd162.pdf) (5 Mo) which suggests that \epsilon_infinity would be the permittivity when neglecting the infrared absorptions of the material(P.563, eq.4). What now?

**EDIT #3**

Ok so it might have to do with ionic motion relative to electronic motion as I read in a document called ""Optical Properties of Solids"" by M. S. Dresselhaus (notes for a class). High frequency relates to a frequency at which ions cannot move but at which electrons can contribute to the polarization and \epsilon.

The general sort of symmetry I'm thinking of I'll call ""update symmetry"" though I imagine it's already been defined and has some other name: Suppose I have some commutative monoid T with action on some set S. Then, if it has ""update symmetry"", there exists some function R such that for all s of S and all t of T, R(t(R(t(s)))) = s.

My question is this: given the commutative monoid T, space/set S, and function R such that R(R(s)) = s, is there any way to find nontrivial monoid actions satisfying all this? (ideally, the family of all actions satisfying such for a given R, T, and S)

Motivation: S is a state space, T a generalization of time/iterations/etc of the dynamic, the monoid action the dynamic, and R the type of time symmetry the whole thing obeys.

(Example: in physics you have CPT symmetry, so R would be the operation of flipping monenta, charges, and parity, S would be the state space for physics (hilbert space) and T would simply be (EDIT: the nonnegative real numbers under addition) representing an amount of time with the action being evolving the system according to the laws of physics for t time.)

A) 1:28 - 1:52

I have the smallest problem with this bit, but he says ""you could float freely around with no sense of up or down"". 1, once you reached terminal velocity in such a tunnel, you would have almost no sense of up or down, correct? 2, you wouldn't be able to ""float around freely"" because you have nothing to push off of and, presumably, no device to thrust you. (mostly just a minor nitpick)


B) 2:55 - 3:06

He says ""gravity from the different parts of the spherical shell would perfectly cancel out, and you'd float freely about inside..."" In the drawing, the stick figure is closest to the top left of the drawn circle. If this were the case, wouldn't the side closest to you have the strongest gravitational pull on you, pulling you toward the edge of the interior of the sphere?

C) 3:20 - 3:35

Hey says ""Back outside of the earth, we wouldn't really notice much difference, at least, not from a gravitational perspective. Falling things would still accelerate at 9.8 m/s^2, a [thrown] baseball would follow the same trajectory, and the moon would follow the same orbit around the earth"" First off, wouldn't gravity on the outside of the Earth be much, much weaker, considering the insanely large amount of mass the Earth would lose if it were hollowed out, thereby causing things to accelerate towards the Earth much slower, baseballs to fly further, and the moon to cease orbiting the Earth and start going in a straight line, as the Earth's gravitational field would now likely be far too weak?

I would *greatly* appreciate some answers to these questions, because looking at what minutephysics is saying with what I have learned in high school physics and science classes throughout my life, it seems like they are just sort of spouting BS.

So I recently installed halos to my projector headlights, they are quite nifty. They are beautiful in their current state but I would like to add some functionality to them, turn signals.

Now I already have (working) turn signals that I would like to incorporate to incorporate into this project.

The Concept:

When the turn signal(s) do not have voltage (off) I would like the halos to be on. When the turn signal(s) have voltage (on) I would like the halo to turn off. Basically I want the halo and directional signal to flip back and forth. I want to make this as simple and cheap as possible (i just bought books for college). I would also like this to work when the hazards come on. Two separate entities are likely part of the solution. 

Information:
Both directional signals have their own separate ground and 12v power wires. The directional signal gets turned on from a microcontroller in the car's computer when the directional is activated. When the directional comes on (for what appears to be .5 seconds) 12v gets powered to the line to make the bulb illuminate, and then the microcontroller stops putting voltage on the line for (what appears to be .5 seconds), hence the ""blinking"" of the light. So then it's natural state (off) the directional signal has 0v on the power line.

Support, solutions, and questions are welcome.

To save us some time: one of the questions that came up at stackoverflow was, ""Is this homework?"" No, I'm just trying to teach myself machine structures and have been thinking about this question. 

I understand how, for example, you can map between SOP (sum-of-product) expressions and a K-map, and why in general you would expect the K-map optimized expression to be simpler, since finding a maximal grouping of 1's corresponds to finding some of the redundancies in a naive SOP expression.

I can vaguely see that the K-map method might not produce optimal solutions, because it seems like the only thing we are actually doing is taking advantage of the distributive and identity (A + A' = 1) properties of the Boolean algebra. But I don't really understand what algebraic operations we are not performing with the K-map, that might allow us to reach a more optimal solution.

The upshot is that I do not know how to start a proof that would show that K-maps are not always optimal.

I was trying to read: http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~jsafaei/MIN-IWLS-06.pdf but in that paper, it is just cited that the problem of finding an optimal Boolean expression is in NP, and I think the author is just implicitly saying that K-maps cannot be optimal, since as an algorithm they are not running in NP time.

I've been following the back-and-forths between Michael Behe and his wide variety of opposition and the point I've landed at is this:

**Lee Strobel's Interview with Michael Behe:**

*(On John McDonald)*

**L:** "". . . For instance, John McDonald of the University of Delaware said mousetraps can work well with fewer parts than yours--and he even drew a picture of a trap that's simpler than the one you drew. Doesn't this undermine your point that your mousetrap is irreducibly complex?"" 

**M:** ""No, not a bit. . . . I *agree* there are mousetraps with fewer parts than mine. As a matter of fact, I said so in my book! [In Darwin's Black Box] I said you can just prop open a box with a stick, or you can use a glue trap, or you can dig a hole . . . The point of irreducible complexity is not that one can't make some other system that could work in a different way with fewer parts. The point is that the trap we're considering right now needs all of its parts to function. The challenge to Darwinian evolution is that it can put together complex systems with no intelligence at all.""

*(On Kenneth Miller)*

**L:** ""[He] has another objection to your trap. [He said]: 'Take away two parts (the catch and the metal bar), and you may not have a mousetrap but you do have a three-part machine that makes a fully functional tie clip or paper clip. Take away the spring, and you have a two-part key chain. The catch of some mousetraps could be used as a fishhook, and the wooden base as a paperweight; useful applications of other parts include everything from toothpicks to nutcrackers and clipboard holders. The point, which science has long understood, is that bits and pieces of supposedly irreducibly complex machines may have different--but still useful--functions.'""

**M:** ""The problem is that it's not an argument against anything I've ever said. In my book, I explicitly point out that some of the components of biochemical machines can have other functions. But the issue remains--can you use numerous, slight, successive modifications to get from those other functions to where we are? . . . He's starting from the finished product--the mousetrap--and disassembling it and moving a few things around to use them for other purposes. . . .

When people put together a mousetrap, they have the disassembled components in different drawers or something, and they grab one from each drawer and put it together. But in the cell, there's nobody there to do that. In molecular machines, components have portions of their shape that are complementary to each other, so they connect with each other in the right way. A positive charge can attract a negative charge, and an oily region can attract another oily region. So if we use the mousetrap as an analogy, one end of the spring would have to have a certain shape or magnetism that just happened to attract and fit with another component of the trap. They'd all have to fit together that way until you had the whole trap assembled by itself. 

In other words, if you just had the components themselves without the ability to bring the other pieces into position, you'd be far from having a functioning mousetrap.""

*(On Barry Hall)*

**L:** ""The 'true acid test [would be to use] the tools of molecular genetics to wipe out an existing multi-part system and then see if evolution can come to the rescue with a system to replace it.' If the system can be replaced purely by naturalistic evolutionary processes, then Behe's theory has been disproved. . . . Do you agree this would be a fair test?""

**M:** ""Yes, I agree. That's a terrific test.""

**L:** [Kenneth Miller said this was apparently done in the laboratory.] Miller concluded: 'No doubt about it--the evolution of biochemical systems, even complex multi-part ones, is explicable in terms of evolution. Behe is wrong.' . . . Tell me, has Hall proved through his experiment that your theory is incorrect?""

**M:** ""No, not really. Actually, Hall is very modest about what his experiment shows. He didn't knock out a complex system and then show how evolution can replace it. Instead, he knocked out one component of a system that has five or six components. And replacing one component in a complex system is a lot easier than building one from scratch. 

For instance, suppose someone told you that natural processes could produce a working television et. You'd say, That's interesting. Why don't you show me?' He would then unplug a thousand television sets. Eventually, a strong wind would come along and blow one plug back into the outlet, and the TV would come on. He would say, 'See? I told you that natural processes could produce a working TV.' But that's not exactly what happened. He wasn't producing a new complex system; there was a glitch introduced and he showed that on occasion this can be fixed by random processes.

That's a little like what went on with Hall's experiment with the bacterium E. *coli*. There was a complex system with a number of different parts, he knocked out one of them, and after a while he showed that random processes came up with a fix for that one part. That's a far cry from producing a brand new system from scratch.

But there's something equally important: Hall made it clear that he had intervened to keep the system going while evolution was trying to come up with a replacement for the missing part. In other words, with the mutation that fixed the glitch. The result never would have actually happened in nature without his intelligent intervention in the experiment. 

Here's another analogy. Suppose you say you can make a three-legged stool by random processes. You take a three-legged stool and break off one leg. Then you hold up the stool so it won't fall over. Finally, a wind comes along, knocks down a tree branch, and it accidentally falls right where the missing leg had been. You're intervening to help the stool through the stage where it would otherwise have fallen over and you've made it possible for the branch to fit in the right place. . . .

[Back to the experiment] You would have had to have simultaneously gotten a second mutation--and the odds of that would have been prohibitive. Hall made it clear that he intervened so that he would get results that would never have actually happened in the natural world. And that is injecting intelligence into the system. . . . Unintentionally, he has shown the limits of Darwinism and the need for design.

**L:** ""What about Darwinists who say, 'Maybe it's merely too early for us to come up with a road map of how these gradual changes developed. Someday we'll better understand the flagellum, so have patience . . .""

**M:** ""You know, Darwinists always accuse folks in the Intelligent Design movement of making an argument from ignorance. Well, that's a pure argument from ignorance! They're saying, 'We have no idea how this could have happened, but let's assume evolution somehow did it.' You've heard of 'God-of-the-gaps'--inserting God when you don't have another explanation? Well, this is 'evolution-of-the-gaps.' Some scientists merely insert evolution when they don't understand something. . . . We may not understand everything about these biological systems, but we do know some things. We do know that these systems [flagellum and cilia] have a number of very specifically matched components that do not lend themselves to a gradualistic explanation. We know that intelligence can assemble complex systems, like computers and mousetraps and things like that. The complexity we see is not going to be alleviated by the more we learn; it can only get more complicated. We will only discover more details about the systems.""

**L:** ""[What about gene duplication that happens during cell division?]""

**M:** ""Sure, gene duplication happens, but what the fans of gene duplication rarely recognize is that when you get a duplicated gene, you don't get a new protein with new properties. You've got the same protein as before. And that's a problem. . . . Let's go back to the mousetrap analogy. . . . Suppose you have a one-component mousetrap, with two ends of a metal spring being bend and pressing against each other under tension so that if a mouse disturbs them, they'll slip and spring and hopefully catch a paw or tail. And say you wanted to develop a more efficient two component trap that has a wooden base as well as the spring.

According to the concept of gene duplication, you would make a copy of the first spring. Now you've got two springs--except the second spring somehow becomes a wooden base. Do you see the conceptual disconnect? You can't just say the spring somehow morphs into a wooden base without doing more than just saying, 'gene duplication did it.'""

Has anyone else rebutted these responses? And if so, could you please list the problems with his arguments? 

I've also heard that there are ""stacks of books"" showing the evolutionary steps taken to create a flagellum, cilia and otherwise, which were provided at the Intelligent Design court case but haven't been able to find that information. Could someone please direct me to the resources?

1)  Given the amount of elements on the modern Periodic Table, is there a way to figure out how many unique compounds are numerically (not practically) possible to construct?  This question is primarily aimed at mathematicians.  I feel they would best be able to answer this question as it deals primarily with numbers.  However, any input, as long as it is explained simply is very much appreciated.  


2.)  How many chemical compounds can **practically** be constructed from the modern periodic table?  As I understand it, some elements are synthesized in a laboratory setting and only exist for a fraction of a second and as such, compounds that incorporate them can't practically be sustained.  This question I pose to chemical engineers or chemists, as I feel they have a better understanding of which compounds can be realistically constructed and maintained.


3.)  Biologists, this question is for you.  I understand that there are some compounds/chemical structures that the human body can, and cannot process.  Are there a continually increasing number of compounds/chemical structures that the human body is required to cope with on either a rare or common basis?


4.)  Psychologists/Psychiatrists, this one is for you.  Is there a way to determine how new *and* existing compounds/chemical structures will affect how human beings interpret them as emotions?  Please negate biological effects when answering this.
  

5.)  Computer Scientists, these last questions are for you.  As an aside, if there are any of you that have experience programming something like Cleverbot or a program similar to it that very roughly replicates human response, I would greatly appreciate your input.  

a.)  What kind of programming goes into something that is seemingly self aware?  How does that program produce responses that are somewhat similar to conversing with another person?

b.)  How many lines of code does it take to roughly replicate human response to a given situation or stimulus?

c.)  Is it possible to program (roughly) how a human reacts emotionally to a widely used compound, such as alcohol, tobacco, dopamine, etc?


I appreciate any provable input, and very certainly appreciate input that is backed up by a source(s).  I don't have a lot of time between work and class to read through comments, so if anyone has any relevant, verifiable information, I would appreciate them commenting and also copying the text in a PM to me so that the Reddit community can have access to the information, but I may also have quicker access to the information.

I would think that based on evolution there would be other creatures that had developed in a manner that they could communicate with us, develop/progress technologically as we do, etc. So why aren't there? 

I do understand that there are creatures that build homes (e.g. Beavers) and there are few primates that use rudimentary tools (like some cool primates in S. America that use rocks as hammers, essentially), and that Dolphins and Whales can apparently communicate with each other.  But none of them come even close to the abilities of Man.

This explosion is perfectly shaped such that all the fuel ejected moves exactly away from the rocket on the +X axis, and by action/reaction law the rocket moves away on the –X axis with the same momentum. Thus if the fuel is ejected at 20m/s the rocket (now weighing 990Kg) is moving at ~ -0.2 m/s.
The average point of mass does not move in this scenario, it remains at origin. The debate comes about on the second burn on the now moving rocket 1 s later. Do consequent burns after the first result in the movement of the average point of mass? I argue no, my dad yes.

My argument is this:
The first burn is simple, there is no movement. We can treat the second burn as Isolated from the first, again it’s point of mass will remain moving on –X at the rate the rocket was pre-burn. Thus, we can see that between this average point and the bit of fuel before that the average point of mass is still on 0,0. This logic can be repeated recursively for each burn showing no total movement. I also want to call conservation of momentum in the system, if the momentum is conserved in the system then the average position of the mass cannot move.

We have both tried arguing to settle this point but neither can articulate it well enough to convince the other. So, I fired up the computer and wrote some code to run a simulation. This simulation, seems correctly coded to me (But I have been known to be wrong...) and it shows that I am wrong and that the average point of mass moves +X with an increase in total momentum in the system along +X after the second and increases with later burns.

Can the wonderful people of /r/askScience reassure me I am wrong and my code is correct? And subsequently explain to me why I am wrong.

If you throw a ball forward from the car at say, 10 m/s, then the velocity of the ball, quite intuitively, is 60 m/s. Simple. However, if you have a flashlight in your hand, and point it forward out the car window, the beam of light moves at the same speed regardless of whether the car is moving or stationary. We call that speed ""the speed of light"", or ""c"". This statement gives me pause, but I don't have any trouble understanding its premise.

I wonder this: Imagine three spaceships, in deep space, with no inertial reference frame. They're just parked next to each other, unmoving, with no road, or ground, or any other ""thing"" to measure their velocity against.

Spaceship A has a broken engine, so it's stranded, and not going anywhere. Spaceships B and C decide that they need to go and get help to get Spaceship A back up and running. So B and C head off in opposite directions as fast as they can, hoping to run into some kind of interstellar gas station, or repair shop. B and C crank up their engines as high as they'll go, and soon, they each find that they are moving away from the stranded Spaceship A at a modest speed of .6c (60% the speed of light). 

What happens when the rescue ships B and C try to measure their velocity relative to each other? Seeing as how they're each moving away from A at .6c, intuition says that their measurement would be 1.2c. However, this exceeds the speed of light. Would Spaceships B and C simply not be able to detect each other's presence, thanks to the fact that their combined velocity is faster than the speed of light? Or would they instead perceive their relative velocity as exactly 1.0c?

I understand the theory of being almost at the speed of light, and how time kind of bends and shortens relative to you (if you were riding on a neutrino) 

What I have questions about is: if you were to surpass the speed of light (even though it is ""impossible"" Would you go back in time? 

I am fairly young, and have been entranced by science and logic for as long as I can remember, but I like to think about things like this. 

How I see it, is it would act like how if the sun disappeared, the earth would no longer be in it's orbit, therefore it is ""instant"" (or so I have read a theory on that, correct me if I am wrong) but the light from the sun would stay there for a good 8 minutes. 

Did the gravity pass through time to stop? Or is it the force itself that has no origination point, that is like one finite layer of force that when turned off from the ""main source"" turns off completely? 

So if you went faster the the speed of light, you pass ""through time"" to get to your destination, even though it's existence is going the same time as any other destination, but you just get there faster? 


What I've been thinking about was that, according to my remedial math skills, Speed= Distance/time. If there was (is) a theoretical speed limit (light), then s would be less than or equal to the speed of light. 

The distance covered can be anything, and time is the result to distance/speed, But when the speed is faster than the distance the time would be either negative or impossible (if negative, practically is it impossible)

Is the speed of light the limiting factor that if something is over that speed, and distance is divided by that number, the time would be negative? 

I know that you can not ""go back in time"" as of this minute, but if you could, you would be able to do something before yourself even got to the destination otherwise.... but it is you that got to the spot and therefore can't see yourself and interact with yourself because you're already there, but back in time you can see yourself meaning..... 


This is my thought process, I'm so sorry. But basically what I'm asking is: 

If you broke the speed of light, would the laws follow similarly to the theory of gravity (instant) that I had read some time ago? Thank you, scientists! I hope to join your ranks one day!

If it matters for anything, I'm not a complete layman, I have a CS degree, but this math could be done by anyone.

* 1 byte = 8 bits
* kb = kilobits
* Kb = kilobytes
* mb = megabits
* Mb = megabytes

* Direct data transfer rate between **Curiosity and Earth**, 32kb/s = **4 Kb/s**
* Data transfer rate between **Curiosity and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter**, 2mb/s = **256 Kb/s**
* Data transfer rate between **Curiosity and Odyssey orbiter**, 256kb/s = **32 Kb/s**

**Assumptions/limitations.**

* Assume the data transfer from the direct connection with the rover does not exceed the data transferred  by the orbiters (this is what I read)
* Curiosity can transfer data to the mars orbiters **8 minutes / day / each orbiter**
* Curiosity always has more data stored locally than can be transmitted, even when transmitting to an orbiter (Snapping a high def color picture once a day would more than guarantee this, let alone the important data)
* The Mars orbiters can transmit more data back to earth per day than they receive from Curiosity per day (I looked up the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter data transfer rate to earth and it's apparently 6mbits/s which is nuts and I don't believe it)

**Throughput:**
So with the orbiters and curiosity itself, we're looking at:
4 kbytes/s * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 24 hours/day = 345600 Kb/day, or 337.5 Mb/day, but this connection won't be operating at peak all the time, and I've read that most of the data will come from the orbiters.  Let's assume the max here is as much as can be transferred by the orbiters.

**Mars orbiters...**

* **Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter** gets 256 Kb/s * 60 seconds/minute * 8 minutes/day = 1228800 Kb/day, or **120 Mb/day**

* **Odyssey orbiter** gets 32 Kb/s * 60 seconds/minute * 8 minutes/day = 15360 Kb/day, or **15 Mb/day**

* That's 120 + 15 Mb/day from the orbiters = 135 Mb/day.  Based on my assumption above, we double that to **270 Mb/day**

* 270 Mb/day / 24 hours/day / 60 minutes/hour / 60 seconds/minute * 1024 Kb/Mb = **3.2 Kb/s**

So, based on the information I can find, the max we're looking at is a throughput of 3.2 Kb/s with a latency (roundtrip) of 1692000 miliseconds, to put it into units we're used to seeing regarding data transfer on the internet.

Natural as opposed to humans? I thought we were primates and a product of the Earth just like everything else.

So I went for the definition at [dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nature?s=t)

The first definition seems to just exclude human activities from being natural but the second excludes humans.

1. The material world, especially as surrounding humankind and existing independently of human activities.
2. the natural  world as it exists without human beings or civilization

And then the fifth...

[5]. the universe, with all its phenomena.*

We were talking what the word ""natural"" actually meant as opposed to ""unnatural"" or even ""super-natural"".

So the question arose, what is the definition of natural and/or are homo-sapiens considered natural?

But even taking this into consideration, the earth does not follow the exact same path each time it passes by the sun due to other gravitational pulls on it, etc. But even taking that into consideration and if someone were to miraculously be able to land someone on the earth in a different year considering those things, one must also consider the movement of galaxies and the general expansion of the universe.

I could also feel myself thinking faster, but with the same clarity as usual. The contrary effect would happen when I'd play the game at 1/4 speed.

Please tell me where I am wrong because I realized this is what I have believed for about 4 years, and have never bothered to look into it.

My understanding is that Climate Change is happening, and also should be happening more than it actually appears to be (more on that in a bit). Humans are pumping CO2 into the atmosphere, and while that CO2 is a limited amount when compared to all the CO2 in the atmosphere naturally, the human amount is unnatural and ""builds up"", meaning the earth does not process it as well as it would if we weren't adding it. In other words, there is more CO2 each and every year, an excess amount if you will, building up from human activity. 

This CO2 in of itself doesn't really matter, as alone it would only warm the earth minimally over centuries. The real problem is feedback. Increased CO2 is merely a catalyst that causes the earth to retain more water vapor. It also melts Ancient ice releasing methane. This vapor and methane will have a warming impact two to four times that of CO2. The consensus in the scientific community is that this should occur, the feedback should be positive, and the earth will warm.

What we have seen since 1998 is a plateau in global temperatures. Though CO2's impact on the atmosphere is logarithmic, we ourselves increase the output of CO2 so rapidly that impact is almost linear if measured in any 10 year period,  and With positive feedback, it is nearly above linear. (meaning that from 2000-2012, we did as much damage as from 1988-2000 simply because we pumped out way more CO2.) This plateau in temperatures is caused by something. A cooling pattern, low solar activity, etc. etc. The point being, that once this cooling phases ends, we should begin to see temperatures rise fairly linearly. In fact, there should be a spike in temperature following the end of whatever is causing this current cooling period. (say .04 degrees celsius) that is at least measurable even over a short time frame. (say the 8 years that follow the end of the cooling period.)

So for anyone who argues that feedback is negative or neutral, there hope is that in fifteen years or so, temperatures will still not have risen, meaning that the earth has ""maxed out"" and CO2 and found magical a way to compensate through increased plant life or hot earth blocking out heat from the sun etc. In reality however, we should start to see warming again soon.

How accurate is this?

I'm wondering if it would be possible (or useful) to use masers (**m**icrowave **a**mplification by **s**timulated **e**mission of **r**adiation) to perform certain types of surgery (particularly tumor removal).

My idea is that by positioning several masers in such a way that they all intersect and constructively interfere at one point (e.g. a tumor), a surgeon could kill harmful tissue in a completely non-invasive manner.

I base this statement upon the assumption that each individual maser is not powerful enough to damage tissue on its own, but at the point where they intersect, the combined power would be enough to burn (there is probably a more appropriate medical term that I am not aware of) the unwanted tissue (tumor).

Important issues that I don't have much information on are penetration depth of EM radiation in tissue, and effects of this radiation on biological systems.  I assume that the wavelength could have significant effects on these properties, and therefore a laser might be more appropriate than a maser.

A simple observation that I have: an injury that occurs earlier in life can be adapted for much better than one that occurs in later in life. Infants have been known to regrow fingertips, and people that have been born blind can have much more development in other regions of their brain to compensate for the lack of sight. Some blind-from-birth people can navigate rooms by making clicking noises with their tongues. If blindness occurs much later in life when you are fully-grown, the brain does not compensate nearly as well.

Likewise, people who have undergone circumcision in their mid or late 20's often report significantly-reduced sexual pleasure and/or feeling. Common opinion stipulates that people circumcised as infants apparently have much-reduced feeling but ""can't know what they are missing"" since the operation was done before they can remember.

But would a person who had circumcision done later in life have the same experience as an infant? How could, or does, the body adapt to circumcision when it is done during infancy? Could the body compensate for the cut foreskin by increasing sensitivity in the remaining skin?

Both Timothy Snyder's ""Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin"", and Norman Naimark's ""Stalin's Genocides"", go into detail about mass killing carried out by the Soviet Union. Snyder's book has a larger scope than Naimark's, but both historians have to grapple with a difficulty: how to estimate the number killed by Stalin.

During the 30's and 40's, the NKVD and other state apparatus were used  by the Soviets to execute people on a massive scale, and to enforce a brutal famine in the Ukraine, which led to ~3 million deaths.

Although meticulous reports were prepared by these agencies, historians don't trust them, because there was enormous pressure (e.g. perform well or die) from above to kill huge numbers of people, and thus to over-report the numbers killed. So historians are not clear about the number of people killed. 

Naimark and Snyder appear to disagree about how many civilians the Soviets deliberately executed. Snyder says ~9 million, Naimark goes as high as 15-20 million people. These numbers do not include people that died 'incidentally', as in the huge numbers of Ukrainians that perished while being forcibly expelled into Kazakhstan. They concerned with only people who were deliberately selected for death, mostly because of who they were.

The additional difficulty is also that records of initial populations are also poor or nonexistent. 

All of this has me wondering, is there any way to use genetic information to estimate these numbers? Would it be possible to, say compare the degree of genetic diversity in these regions in the past, with the genetic diversity of today? Surely the gene pool would have have contracted somewhat by all of the killings. 

Of course, the number of additional difficulties for this problem is daunting, especially since, as Snyder's book makes clear, these regions are areas where both the Nazis and the Soviets killed in huge numbers.

Also, obviously genetic information would not distinguish how anyone died, but I'm wondering if it might help historians get a better idea of what the initial populations were before the disasters of the period.

Radars are large metallic objects and, if exposed, would defeat the stealth characteristics of the F-22. One method would have the radar simply blast through the RAM (radar absorbing material) with extra power. However, this method poses serious problems to receiving radar returns. The return signal, dramatically weakened by r^2 losses and losses to the targets reflection coefficient, now has to pass though heavy duty radar absorbing material. The measured returns would be incredibly hard to detect. I read on a defense blog that the returns could be detected with another antenna perhaps embedded in the wings (above the RAM but designed in a way to scatter returns).  I assume that this would be troublesome because the transmit antenna is different from the receiver; reciprocity cannot be used. 

The plus side of this method is the F-22's radar's metal is all but invisible to the enemy. The enemy's signals, all ready attenuated by distance, must pass through RAM, bounce off the F-22's metallic radar, pass back through RAM, then travel all the way back... no chance. 

I recently thought of a bolder theory: the nose cone of the F-22 lacks RAM in front of the radar. Instead of shielding the radar from view, the radar itself is designed to be stealthy. How is this possible? Classic dish shaped radars obviously have enormous returns: illuminate them at any angle and geometry dictates that you'll get a decent return  (i'm talking about an enemy radar actually getting a return of the target's radar). But, the F-22 does not use a dish; it uses a planar AESA. A planar antenna/array would scatter incoming radio waves away from the original transmitter (just use snell's law). If the incoming wave was perfectly perpendicular it would bounce back, but even a slight error would compound over a significant distance and send the wave away from its original transmitter. Also because the F-22's radar is an array of a ~1500 miniature elements, perhaps the radar's face could be a large slab of RAM will little slots where the elements are. This would make it all but impossible to get a reflection in the direction of the transmitter, and could be tweaked to greatly reduce the intensity of any return whatsoever. 
 
**Edit:** I am not curious about hiding the signals emitted from the F-22's radar, rather I am inquiring about how the large metallic AN/APG-77 radar is hidden from enemy view without hampering its performance. Instead of radar bouncing of the plane, imagine it bouncing off of the metal in the target's radar.

Consider a closed system containing a gas and photovoltaic cell that are both at an equilibrium temperature T - low enough for the cell to work.
Certainly, the radiation spectrum (based on T) of the gas would occasionally produce photons which cause a voltage difference / current in the cell, which can be used to perform work (right?). Even if the energetic enough photons would be extremely rare at the temperature T, they would occur sometimes, perform useful work, and then obviously reheat the system (conservation of energy not violated).

My best guess is that at least as often as a photon is absorbed and turned into current, current is lost and turned into a photon by the photovoltaic cell, thus requiring a significantly ""hotter"" photon source. Other than that, perhaps some temperature property of photovoltaics I missed (remember I am considering a system where the temperature is low enough for the cell to work).

Relatedly, reading the [Solar Cell wiki's theory section](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell#Theory), the second point saying: ""...the electrons are only allowed to move in a single direction,"" sounds vaguely like Maxwell's Demon - and probably the cause of my misunderstanding.

In this time you would be displaced about 4.5x10^12 kilometers.  (Please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).

If a system contained infinite potential energy, then every form in this system would also possess infinite potential energy (particle, wave, field, etc -- ""form"", lets call them). 

A result of this is that any interaction event between these forms would be incapable of altering the future state of the system (because entropy requires that interaction events disorder potential during system evolution, otherwise pseudo-stable sub-systems cannot arise). 

In such a system would exist a complete chaos of events, each of which precipitate no predictable changes, as that which reigns supreme. It would be a true chaos. Shining light upon an object would not cause a reflection, refraction, absorption, or any other behavior consistently. Same for exposing something to heat, or cold, or electric current.. Results would be random. This place would exist without causality as a natural consequence of possessing infinite potential. 

Furthermore, a consequence of this causal deficiency would be that no method could exist by which to measure any property of the system, because any interaction with a form would not alter it and return only random information. 

This all seems to describe the equivalent state to an absolute static, a zero potential. If it is an unmeasurable, unobservable ""hyle foam"", then by what justification does it truly exist? To possess only the property of existing would seem equivalent to not existing, something to which I would bet one trillion hylidollars on indeed! 

My understanding of reality equates static with nothingness, and zero potential with nothingness. A natural extension of this would be to consider infinite potential ""absolute somethingness"", or some such difficult to describe property (I am not sure what the word for the opposite of nothing is, if the commonly known manifestation of a something is considered only as the intermediary between these two opposites). 

What implications would this all have for the question: ""Why does existence exist?"";

It seems to me, that it would imply that existence must exist, because not existing would be equivalent to existing absolutely. Perhaps then what we observe is some instant during a cycle between these two/one state/s. Perhaps it could be said that this was the state occupied by the cosmos before the great event 13 billion years ago (getting ahead of myself here, but basically heat-death = nothing = absolute somethingness -&gt; entropy -&gt; evolve -&gt; heat-death ~ repeat indefinitely)

So, the benefit, if any is minimal. However, the cost to human health, according to the EPA's compiled research is far from minimal. 

A sampling of the EPA's research compiled in the link to the entire PDF book below:


a) *Risk to the brain.* According to the National Research Council (NRC), fluoride can damage the brain. Animal studies conducted in the 1990s by EPA scientists found dementia-like effects at the same concentration (1 ppm) used to fluoridate water, while human studies have found adverse effects on IQ at levels as low as 0.9 ppm among children with nutrient deficiencies, and 1.8 ppm among children with adequate nutrient intake.

b) *Risk to the thyroid gland.* According to the NRC, fluoride is an “endocrine disrupter.” Most notably, the NRC has warned that doses of fluoride (0.01-0.03 mg/kg/day) achievable by drinking fluoridated water, may reduce the function of the thyroid among individuals with low-iodine intake. Reduction of thyroid activity can lead to loss of mental acuity, depression and weight gain. 

See: NRC (2006). p. 189-224.


c) *Risk to bones.* According to the NRC, fluoride can diminish bone strength and increase the risk for bone fracture. While the NRC was unable to determine what level of fluoride is safe for bones, it noted that the best available information suggests that fracture risk may be increased at levels as low 1.5 ppm, which is only slightly higher than the concentration (0.7-1.2 ppm) added to water for fluoridation.

See: NRC (2006). p. 107-148.


d) *Risk for bone cancer.* Animal and human studies – including a recent study from a team of Harvard scientists – have found a connection between fluoride and a serious form of bone cancer (osteosarcoma) in males under the age of 20. The connection between fluoride and osteosarcoma has been described by the National Toxicology Program as ""biologically plausible."" Up to half of adolescents who develop osteosarcoma die within a few years of diagnosis.

e) *Risk to kidney patients.* People with kidney disease have a heightened susceptibility to fluoride toxicity. The heightened risk stems from an impaired ability to excrete fluoride from the body. As a result, toxic levels of fluoride can accumulate in the bones, intensify the toxicity of aluminum build-up, and cause or exacerbate a painful bone disease known as renal osteodystrophy.

I imagine that even Earth’s protective magnetic field has to be “porous” at times, allowing some of this radiation to come through.

And before anyone reiterates that there is a “storm every five days, up to three storms a day during a solar maxima, so there is no reason to worry as these are usual events,” I am focusing solely on record-breaking peak solar events within the last few years as these have yielded unexpected activity.

The next phase -- the solar maximum -- lasts from 2012 to 2015. During this period of time, massive solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can occur which could be strong enough to knock out satellites, disable high-voltage transformers and cripple communications worldwide.

Doug Biesecker, top solar physicist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), told the News severe solar storms have occurred in the past. The strongest was in 1859 and rendered telegraph machines useless. Another slightly smaller geomagnetic storm occurred in 1921.

""If the 1921 storm happened today, it would knock out power from Maine to Georgia,"" Biesecker said. It would affect ""130 million people and 350 transformers.""

Transformers, he noted, can take over a year to fix and are not made in the U.S.

An active region on the sun, numbered AR 1504, rotated into view over the left side of the sun on June 10, 2012. The region fired off two M-class flares and two coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on June 13 and June 14, 2012. The first flare lasted for a relatively long three hours, peaking on June 13, 2012 at 9:17 AM EDT. The associated CME traveled at approximately 375 miles per second and is directed toward Earth, though due to its slow speed, the effect on Earth is expected to be minimal.

The second M-class flare was also a long-duration flare, and it peaked on June 14, 2012 at 10:08 AM EDT. The CME associated with this flare is traveling much faster — preliminary analysis at Goddard’s Space Weather Center indicates it is traveling at speeds of approximately 800 miles per second. It is traveling toward Earth, and could also impact Mars and the Spitzer spacecraft.

The Space Weather Center models estimate that both CMEs will arrive on June 16.

Particle radiation consists of a stream of charged or neutral particles, both charged ions and subatomic elementary particles. This includes solar wind, cosmic radiation, and neutron flux in nuclear reactors.   

Cosmic radiation is not a common concern, as the Earth's atmosphere absorbs it and the magnetosphere acts as a shield, but it poses a problem for satellites and astronauts and frequent fliers are also at a slight risk. Cosmic radiation is extremely high energy, and is very penetrating.

[Random comments from articles.]

“In addition, the Earth's magnetic field isn't perfectly rigid when impacted by the rush of particles; it bends and moves. And by Faraday's law of induction, this moving magnetic field can induce currents in conductors on Earth (this is how generators convert physical motion to electricity). Conductors optimal for collecting this generated current are electrical transmission lines because of their length (currents are generated per unit length of conductor ""cut"" by the moving field). Short conductors (human-scaled size) are not significant affected - the currents induced are smaller than typical radio transmitter induced currents.”

“Our magnetic field is increasingly getting weaker.”

“Does that mean there'll be a period of time when the current field's strength would be too weak to protect us?”

“We had one [CME] in 1947 that was 40 times the diameter of earth.”

“It's more likely it would it affect ICDs and Pacemakers.""

“If you're a bird, whale, dolphin, or other animal that uses the electromagnetic field to navigate it will play hell with your sense of direction.”

Doing problems, the additional research I've done, and just thinking about the concepts has helped quite a bit, but it's still not quite coming together.  The problem really manifests when doing problems that are a bit more conceptual in nature and necessitate the use of multiple concepts - it's clear I'm not quite getting ""it,"" but I have no clue what ""it"" is.

Any help would be much appreciated.

Today, my father and I were talking about how back in the early 90's, he used to be a L.A. Sherrif, and saw really.. bad stuff. This one story in particular, goes back to where during the night he had to head out on a call for a car accident on the freeway. Upon getting there, he notices that the driver of the vehicle is still in the vehicle- at least his body is. At some point during the impact, the drivers head managed to detach itself from the body, travel through the windshield (this was an old-style windshield, none of that fun safety glass we have now), and was found lying some ~55ish feet away on the highway. Given the amount of force that it would have taken to detach the head, plus the distance and trajectory of the head (evidenced by the blood splatter trail) the car was estimated going from anywhere between 85 - 100ish MPH upon point of impact.

As we were talking about this, the point came up about how during a de-capitation, the human brain still continues to function anywhere from about 15 seconds, to roughly a minute and a half after being severed from the body. Which means that it is entirely possible, that provided that the windshield itself did not knock this person unconscious when he hit it, he might have been fully or partially aware of the situation as he flew threw the air. 

Apparently, given the blood tracks on the ground, in addition to the sort of catapult stresses that the head would have been presumably under upon detaching from the body, the head could quite possibly have been spinning through the air. Hence how this question came up up. 

So, the question is simply this:

If the remains of the man was still conscious upon detaching from it's body, and making it through the windshield, would the brain have enough time to react to the signals of movement within the inner ear canal (sloshing), and if so, would it attempt to send signals to a body that no longer exists (according to the brain that is.).

It's quite difficult to compare these things - some other cars use electric engines, few manufacturers tell us what the power-rating of the engines are, and not all cars come equipped with roller-ball bearings (some are just bushed bearings), so the output power of the engine is quite useless, and dynamometers are difficult to build yourself or gain access to.

----------------------------

Letting the car accelerate to top speed, measuring the time it takes and the distance the car travels, allows me to figure out what the acceleration is on average.

I figure that if I use the mass of the car as well, I can figure out how much energy has been spent in moving it, and if I divide it with the time it took, I can calculate the average wattage.

So far I'm confident that I'm not completely off track.

The actual formula, though, I'm not sure that I've constructed correctly

**((Distance[m])/(0,5 x time[s]^2 ) x (mass[kg] x distance[m]))/(time[s])**

For my own car, the approximate results were 50 meters, 5 seconds, and one kilo, which gives me 40 W (or 0.05HP), which seems a bit low.

Not to mention the huge doses released at death.

I would imagine that many scientists and the scientific community out of pure curiosity and desire to crack open so many mysteries would be dying to do more research on DMT, but is that the case and is there a real push for more extensive research?

I respond to you all by saing you do realize that the force we attract each other if you are 80kg and i am 55kg is 2.93 * 10^-7. you're measuring in newtons but multiplying kg and meters. 
gravity (not due to acceleration) is 6.67 *10^-11 N/(kg^2 * m^2). you're using acceleration, which is (-)9.81 N/(m/s^2). which thus means you're cheating because we're standing 1 meter apart and are not falling.

furthermore, say that you do gain that extra kilo. the force of attraction would then be 2.97 * 10^-7.
the difference between the two is an increase of 1.36% of an already small number.

Density=Mass/Volume, and black holes definitely have a non-infinite mass (otherwise its gravity would be infinitely attractive). If density is infinite and mass is not, the volume of the black hole would have to be infinitely small, right?

**Question(s) two**: Now, to my understanding, black holes can be formed when a big enough star runs out of fuel. (Are there any other ways to form black holes?). Stars need to have some sort of fusion reaction  going on in its center in order to counteract the massive force of gravity, and when fuel for this reaction runs out, the force of gravity overcomes the *forces that keep neutrons/electrons from occupying the same space* (pauli exclusion forces? is there some kind of name for this force?). The star then collapses in on itself. But how does this make for a black hole with infinite density? Wouldn't all the matter in the star occupy the space of a single neutron? How can the black hole get smaller than that?

I'm having trouble with escape velocity, though.

Wiki on escape velocity says:

&gt;Because of the atmosphere it is not useful and hardly possible to give an object near the surface of the Earth a speed of 11.2 km/s (40,320 km/h), as these speeds are too far in the hypersonic regime for most practical propulsion systems and would cause most objects to burn up due to atmospheric friction or be torn apart by atmospheric compression. For an actual escape orbit a spacecraft is first placed in low Earth orbit (160–2,000 km) and then accelerated to the escape velocity at that altitude, which is a little less — about 10.9 km/s. The required change in speed, however, is far less because from a low Earth orbit the spacecraft already has a speed of approximately 8 km/s.

Wiki on Low Earth Orbit says:

&gt; The speed needed to achieve a stable low earth orbit is about 7.8 km/s, but reduces with altitude. The delta-v needed to achieve low earth orbit starts around 9.4km/s. Atmospheric and gravity drag associated with launch typically adds 1.5–2.0 km/s to the delta-v launch vehicle required to reach normal LEO orbital velocity of around 7.8 km/s (28,080 km/h).

So, do those two things make sense together?  If so, what am I missing?

And the ultimate question is if I'm launching a rocket into Low Earth Orbit, what is the final speed (total delta V) I need to put at the end of the rocket equation to make that happen?  9.4 km/s?  Or 11.2 km/s?  Or 10.9?

Mass into energy in a small area you have a long source of energy for robots and stuff. 

EQ = ((6.022 x 10^23/22000) = 1 mev = 1mev *( 6.022 x 10^23/22000) * 1..6 10^-19 = 80,000 (j/s) 1/20th, small container

This is not practical considering the energy required to produce 20 MeV protons, and the energy losses from scattered protons.

Mg24(p,p'd)Na22 is not practical.

Would you be able to propel the positively charged deutons at 20 mev the energy could be less, due to 30T for little energy due to superconductive linear accelerators.

less energy by my resistance more by magnetic push
1/R=A R is lower A &gt; than Rcu, energy to push it
but still long periods of energy loss 80,000/s isnt bad for long periods like a 2.6 year battery for 1 kg of fuel, 28 Tj.

In it, the player is responsible for blowing up a ""Mass Relay"" in space, a plot device that supposedly releases ridiculous amounts of energy on its destruction and ends up killing all 300,000 individuals living in the system.

OK, so how ridiculous is ridiculous? In-game information places the colonized planet of Aratoht at 1.15 AU. The outermost planet of Bastzuda orbits at 8.9 AU and the ""Alpha"" Relay is farther away. That gives a lower bound of 7.75 AU on the distance the explosion has to travel. As a side note, if the relay explosion obeys the speed of light (it very well might not since its THING is enabling long-range FTL travel) that means the colonists had at least an hour before anything hit them.

Back to the original question. In Mass Effect 2, the Alpha Relay explosion is described as killing everyone on Aratoht (I'd assume by radiation, unless someone has an explanation for an alternate mechanism?) How much energy would this require? What kind of explosion would this have to be like? Bounds/assumptions to work with:

Spherical explosion: not ""aimed"" at Aratoht

Minimum distance to target: 7.75 AU ~= 1.16 x 10^12 m (orbit of Bastzuda - orbit of Aratoht)

Maximum mass of Alpha Relay: 1.52 x 10^21 kg (Alpha Relay similar to Charon relay, which is &lt;= the estimated mass of Charon)

As a high school science teacher I have to deal with misconceptions on many levels. Not only do pupils come into class with a variety of misconceptions, but to some degree we end up telling some lies just to give pupils some idea of how reality works (Terry Pratchett et al even reference it as necessary ""lies to children"" in the Science of Discworld books).

So the question is: which misconceptions do people within your field(s) of science encounter that you find surprising/irritating/interesting? To a lesser degree, at which level of education do you think they should be addressed?

These are all theoretical questions obviously, because travelling at speed of light with any mass requires infinite energy and all that jazz.

Would time stop for everyone in a spaceship traveling at speed of light?

So pretend clock1 is inside a spaceship that will travel close to the speed of light and clock2 will be outside of the ship at a stationary position.

The spaceship is now travelling near speed of light and the pilot looks at clock1 and it is functioning correctly, the ship will travel this speed for 1 hour. At the same time clock2 is functioning at a much higher rate because of time dilation.

lets say speed of light is 100km/h so i can more easily wrap my mind around it.

The ship is travelling at 99km/h and the pilot wants to travel 99km away, so he sets clock1 to beep after one hour. But because of time dilation wouldn't the actual distance he travels be way off? 

Let's say travelling at 99km/h sets time dilation ratio to every second on clock1 will be 1 minute on clock2

the ship is flying through space at near c, clock1 and clock2 is set to alarm after one hour. On clock1 one minute passes and on clock2, one hour has passed. Does it make sense that from clock2's pov the ship has now travelled 99km? So the ship is actually off by 99km*60?

If this is true, and travelling at the speed of light stops time for clock1
then to travel to Andromeda at speed of light would be instantaneous?

Would travelling at 1 m/s less than speed of light be like warping through space? (but not really because time would pass ridiculously fast outside of the ship)

A 6.00-kg block initially at rest is pulled to the right along a horizontal frictionless surface by a constant, horizontal force F of magnitude 12.0 N. Find the speed of the block after it has moved 3.00 m.

So...
W = F∆x = (12N)(3meter) = 36N•M = 36joules.
W_net= K_f- K_i 
K = 1/2 mv^2
v_f= √2w/m= √(2(36j))/6kg=3.46m/s

But what I don't understand is that if I pull a cart with mass M, using force F, how does the distance I pull this cart determine the speed? I would assume if I pull a cart with a constant force F, it wouldn't matter if I pulled the cart 10 ft or 100ft, the speed would remain the same.

Thanks.

Edit: Thank you to everyone for your quick responses! =)

Also what helped was thinking of Newtons first law "" objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force "".

When I used my example of ""me pulling the cart"", what happened was that I pictured myself at a constant speed, pulling the cart with a constant force, however, with no acceleration, there is no force!

And sure enough, the pain came on a few seconds after the impact. I started to think why that was. So my question is why is there a delay between things like stubbing our toe or pinching our finger and the pain that results from it?

Edit: Here is the best answer so far from SimpleBen

It is actually closer to 1 m/s for the C fibers that carry pain, and in the range of 20-50 m/s for light touch. In other words, you stub your toe, and you feel the stub in 40-50 msec, but you don't feel the pain for well over a second.

I usually explain this class of effect with a knife-cut example. You are cutting up food for dinner, and you cut your finger. 20-30 msec later you can feel the cut, carried by A-beta fibers that carry light tough information. The sharpness of the knife (carried by A-delta fibers which run around 5 m/s) comes on around 200 msec, and the burning pain (carried by C fibers) not until a full second passes.

To be perfectly clear, this terminology, and these speeds, refer to the ""axon conduction velocities"" for different types of peripheral neurons in somatic sensation.

1. We describe the first principle quantum number, n, as being the energy level that an individual electron resides at inside an atom. The smaller this number, the lower the energy of the electron, the closer it is to the nucleus for any given subshell.

2. The closer you get to the speed of light, the higher your relativistic mass is. The mass increases with 1/[sqrt(1-(v/c)^2 )].

3. The higher the electron's relativistic mass, the smaller the radius of its own subshell orbit. Therefore, the smaller the atom and this helps explain why certain heavier atoms get smaller than otherwise expected.

4. The higher Z in your element, the more charge your nucleus has, and somehow (don't know why, besides a classical explanation that is likely wrong) this makes your electron travel faster. I relate this to the length of years each planet has that orbits the Sun. Pluto is way out there, so it orbits at a longer period.

What I don't understand:

1. Why exactly does a heavier nucleus with more charge make your electrons go faster? What electrons specifically go faster, just the inner, low energy electrons? These are already close to the nucleus, so makes sense that these get contracted, but what about the outer electrons that are effectively shielded from the nucleus? Do these get contracted any? The whole atom shouldn't decrease in radius just because the inner electrons decrease, but that's what I seem to read.

2. It seems perpetual. The inner s-suborbitals are close to the nucleus, so they must be traveling faster than outer electrons, so they must be getting heavier, so they must be getting closer to the nucleus according to the Bohr model, and since they're closer to the nucleus they must now be traveling faster, so they get heavier.... Obviously this can't go on forever. What is the balancing side of this effect? Pauli Exclusion Principle?

3. Chicken or the Egg: What is the correct order of logic for this relativistic contraction explanation?

The universe is only ~13.7 billion years old but we can see things so far away because the space in between them and us has expanded.

Here is a quote from the wikipedia article on ""metric expansion of space"": 

""Since the parts of the universe cannot be seen after their speed of expansion away from us exceeds the speed of light, the size of the entire universe could be greater than the size of the observable universe.
 
It is also possible for a distance to exceed the speed of light times the age of the universe, which means that light from one part of space generated near the beginning of the Universe might still be arriving at distant locations (hence the cosmic microwave background radiation).""

So basically we cannot see some objects that are so far way from us because light has not had enough time to traverse the space in between us.  However that light may never get to us since that space is still expanding.

**Now To The Question:** I would like to the the size of the entire universe.  Even though we can't see objects expanding away from us faster than the speed of light, *we can use estimates of the expansion of space throughout the universe's history to calculate the total size*.  (We know space is currently expanding at ~74 (km/s)/Mpc which ROUGHLY means a person floating in space one million parsecs away from us will be 74 km farther away the next second.)  I know we don't have direct measurements of the expansion of space all throughout time but we must have a rough idea from indirect measurements, right?

For the more savvy, I am looking for the comoving distance to the most distant place in space.

The orbital speed of the Solar System about the center of the Galaxy is approximately 220 km/s or 0.073% of the speed of light. At this speed, it takes around 1,400 years for the Solar System to travel a distance of 1 light-year, or 8 days to travel 1 AU (astronomical unit).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way#Sun.27s_location_and_neighborhood

---

&gt; The orbital speed of the Earth averages about 29.8 km/s (107,000 km/h), which is fast enough to cover the planet's diameter (about 12,600 km) in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon (384,000 km) in four hours.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#Orbit

---

&gt; The angular speed of Earth's rotation in inertial space is (7.2921150 ± 0.0000001) ×10−5 radians per SI second (mean solar second). Multiplying by (180°/π radians)×(86,400 seconds/mean solar day) yields 360.9856°/mean solar day, indicating that Earth rotates more than 360° relative to the fixed stars in one solar day. Earth's movement along its nearly circular orbit while it is rotating once around its axis requires that Earth rotate slightly more than once relative to the fixed stars before the mean Sun can pass overhead again, even though it rotates only once (360°) relative to the mean Sun. Multiplying the value in rad/s by Earth's equatorial radius of 6,378,137 m (WGS84 ellipsoid) (factors of 2π radians needed by both cancel) yields an equatorial speed of 465.1 m/s, 1,674.4 km/h or 1,040.4 mi/h. Some sources state that Earth's equatorial speed is slightly less, or 1,669.8 km/h. This is obtained by dividing Earth's equatorial circumference by 24 hours. However, the use of only one circumference unwittingly implies only one rotation in inertial space, so the corresponding time unit must be a sidereal hour. This is confirmed by multiplying by the number of sidereal days in one mean solar day, 1.002 737 909 350 795, which yields the equatorial speed in mean solar hours given above of 1,674.4 km/h.

&gt; The tangential speed of Earth's rotation at a point on Earth can be approximated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude. For example, the Kennedy Space Center is located at 28.59° North latitude, which yields a speed of: 1,674.4 kilometres per hour (1,040.4 mph) × cos (28.59) = 1,470.23 kilometres per hour (913.56 mph)

I have no idea how the local gravity from such gargantuan masses in high density would effect geometric distortion, perhaps someone else might know.

Edit: It has occured to be that rotational period was misleading when I was searching for upper limits on rotational forces, since the speed would decrease on very short rotational periods due to the very small circumference of these objects.

**EDIT 2:** [Here](http://i.imgur.com/lKPX6.jpg) is a crude schematic of the device.  This drawing is meant to emphasize the range of motion needed (i.e. what joints are required to allow the arm to move virtually anywhere within its reach).  It obviously needs some fixing, but it's a start. (I know that I have two bolts going into each other, that's impossible).

**Edit 3:** The [Steadicam arm](http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/steadicam2.htm) has just been suggested by DrSpookymuffin.  It seems like a viable design, though I would go with the old version with just the simple spring, to start.

1. Placing 99942 in the L2 between the Earth and Moon would place it in an excellent position to be used as a tethering anchor for a future space elevator.

2. Its trajectory is close enough that the linear transformations describing both the finite-dimensional approximation to the solution of the differential equation measuring its projected trajectory and the spanning set of two ion-engine thrusters can be reasonably expected to be sparse.

3. L2 would be an excellent place to put a telescope, and with 99942's size, it could easily accommodate some sort of observatory. This would make it easier for manned missions to repair/overhaul/upgrade, as well as providing a more suitable laboratory than the ISS.

Obviously, this would be a monumental undertaking far exceeding anything our species has previously ventured. However, given the rarity of such opportunities, the mean value of which greatly dwarfs the average human lifespan, I believe the benefits vastly outweigh the risks.

So being from Europe and living in America, I hear a lot of Europeans complain that ""most Americans have never even left their country"". What they don't consider is that, traveling from one side of the continental U.S. (N. Washington) to the other side (S. Florida) is as far as driving from Berlin to Pakistan. You'd likely have crossed 12-15 countries on the latter trip, but stayed ""in the same country"" for the former trip.

I sometimes meet Americans who are impressed that I've traveled to [some number] of foreign countries, and then they tell me ""I've only been to Canada"". However, if you consider only distance, I could probably visit 25 different countries within the same radius from my own country, simply because Western European countries are so small relative to American states and Canadian provinces.

So does anyone know of any map or data, or can they otherwise sustain the argument that Europeans are on average ""better traveled"" than Americans, considering average farthest distance, or an average of most common distances traveled by Western Europeans going on vacation (or Europeans of one single nation if such data exists)?

He thinks that it is possible that life began as a self replicating molecule or virus like particle that could travel with sufficent velocity to propagate as a wave.

I told him that it is impossible for any sort of matter to attain the speed of light, and when I did the debroglie equation to see what sort of wavelength the object would have lambda=h/mv (for mass I used the weight of the human genome in kilograms) and determined the wavelength to be 6.8e-28 meters and then using v=c/lambda I got 4.4e35/s for the frequency.

I then wanted to see how much energy is necessary to impart the velocity of the speed of light to the human genome sized DNA, and used e=hv and got a very surprsing number: 291.7 Joules. 

This was very strange, but then I remembered that there is a relationship between mass and velocity, and that mass increases with velocity. 

I couldn't really explain it to him that well, but I know that an object with mass cannot attain the speed of light. Could you guys help me out?

Because the symptoms of SJS are so similar with those of Alzheimer's (but easily diagnosed post-mortem due to the different ways the two damage the brain), and due to the fact that the U.S. has decided to deal with the BSE (""Mad Cow"") with questionable (some say inadequate) protocols, what would be your best guess as to the actual prevalence of prion disease in the U.S?

The basics:

The biorocket would be grown in a physical shape that is both aerodynamic, and supportive of internal components. It would be capable of digesting ""food"" in order to sustain itself, support its growth, and produce a combustible byproduct that is stored in a pressurized bladder(s). It would be capable of autonomously releasing and igniting the stored fuel when reaching maturity, which would result in the organism launching itself into the sky under it's own power.

Possible features:

The organism could posses a rudimentary nervous system with senses that could detect balance and move control surfaces accordingly to maintain a specific design trajectory for as long as it's fuel source lasts.

For example, what about the asteroid 2005 YU55, which is quite small and passes very close? Here's what I have so far (simplified Newtonian):

----

Mass: not known, but let's use the mass of similar-sized asteroid 2000 DP107, found [here](http://home.earthlink.net/~jimbaer1/astmass.txt), 4.57e10 kg

Velocity at closest approach: 12,964 m/s (from [here](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203733504577024023220331032.html))

Distance at closest approach: 323,478,144 m (from same as above)

----

Orbital Velocity:

V = (GM/r)^0.5 = (6.67e-11 * 5.97e24 / 323478144)^0.5 = 1109.5 m/s

Required impulse = (4.57e10)(12964 - 1109.5) = 5.418e14 kg*m/s

Impulse of shuttle SRB = (120 seconds)(1.25e7 Newtons) = 1.5e9 N*s

5.418e14 / 1.5e9 = 361200

----

Haven't done this in a while, and I can't remember how to solve the integrals for Gibbs energy.

E.g., for a process at one bar, but a temperature different from standard conditions, it would be:

𝐺(𝑇) = 𝐺(298) + ∫ 𝐶p𝑑𝑇− 𝑇 ∫ 𝐶p𝑇 𝑑𝑇
right? Assuming you got rG° from a chart, how would you get to G(T) from there (and solve the integral)?

Next thing: 298 K, but under pressure, that'd be

G = d H° - Td S° +∫ d VdP

If I'm looking for a pressure where all phases would coexist, I think it'd have to be dG=0 (again, how does this integral add up to the equation?).

And the equilibrium constant would be calculated via dG= - RT ln K (for the current dG I guess?) And all of these could be added up to a phase diagram with Clausius-Clapeyron?

I think there were similar, simple ways to find H, S and Volume with integrals, but I don't remember any of it, so any help with those would be greatly appreciated as well.

I've had shitty internet for as long as I can remember. ADSL on old phonelines and being 3600m from the nearest telephone center results in a slow/unstable internet connection. So I've tried to call our ISP to see if there's anything they can do, apparently ""increasing the signal &amp; increasing it more if the problems persist"" is something that should work but does nothing.

Other options such as fiber optics require that I get signatures around my neighbourhood and then it'll still take a while for us to get access to it. It's also very expensive. There is however a guy who lives about 150m away from us that has fiber that he shares with a few other houses on that street. He's fine with sharing it with us as well but we'll have to fix everything ourselves. We already have pipes from his house to ours that was put there for our TV cables so we can easily put the new cables through there.

Those who got their fiber from him used copper cables from his house to theirs but they live closer to him than I do. If we get a fibercable we will need a transducer (?) that costs quite a lot so if copper cables work I'd prefer using that. I tried to find out as much as I could about copper cables and everywhere I went they only promised 100 mbit/s if the cable was shorter than 100m. I live about 150m from this guy and then I'll need to pull the cables up to the 3rd floor so I'll need to know:

How much does the speed get reduced if I use more than 100m of copper cable? Are there any problems up to 200m?
Will it affect stability at all?

I have recently had to learn (the hard way) that a lot of science is not really *science* when politically charged. Could you help me analyze a study for its validity? I really do not want to be found guilty of scientific ignorance anymore. 

http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/04/study-of-the-day-strict-parenting-and-same-sex-urges-lead-to-homophobia/256019/

&gt; In one of them, a split-second timed task, the scientists first subliminally primed the subjects by flashing either the word ""me"" or ""others"" on a computer screen for 35 milliseconds. They then showed the participants words like ""homosexual"" and ""heterosexual"" as well as pictures of straight and gay couples, and measured how quickly they could place these in ""gay"" or ""straight"" categories. A faster association of ""me"" with ""gay"" and a slower association of ""me"" with ""straight"" indicated an implicit gay orientation.

Could you help me understand things such as:

1) The validity of the experiment outlined above - how does it measure what it claims to measure? Particularly, how valid is this statement: **A faster association of ""me"" with ""gay"" and a slower association of ""me"" with ""straight"" indicated an implicit gay orientation.**

2) Is the study size of the experiment large enough to draw proper conclusions from? I know of a previous experiment (conducted in 1996) that tested similar conclusions, but the study size was about about ~60 people - are these kinds of ""sample sizes"" large enough to draw statistical conclusions from?

3) Have these experiments been repeated in order to be verified?

The article:  ""Parental Autonomy Support and Discrepancies Between Implicit and Explicit Sexual Identities: Dynamics of Self-Acceptance and Defense,"" is published in the journal Journal of Personality and Social Psychology

**EDIT:** I have access to the article from my university, but I am unsure if I am allowed to post excerpts that I have questions about over here? What is the copyright policy with regard to this in general?

I have solved it in two ways and I got to different answers.
I am going to use d for diagonal and l for the length and k as the length of the at rest square, and x as the speed of the square and s as the speed of light.

The first

*We know that the area of a square is equal to l^2 = k^2 , so the side is k, and in movement its area is .36k^2 so the length of the side is .6k and using the formula of special relativity which is l=l.*Sqrt[1-x^2 / s^2 ]
so .6k=k*Sqrt[1-x^2 / s^2 ]
and you get the speed of the side is .8s, so the speed of the other side is .8s so the speed of the diagonal will equal Sqrt[(.8s)^2 + (.8s)2]= 1.14s which is faster than the speed of light and that doesn't make sense.

the second methode

We know that the area of a square is equal to d^2 /2 so the diagonal at rest is equal to d^2 /2 =k^2 then the diagonal equal k*Sqrt[2], and after moving d^2/ 2 =.36 k^2 so the diagonal is equal to k*Sqrt[.72], by applying the equation k*Sqrt[.72]=k*Sqrt[2]*Sqrt[1- x^2 /s^2 ]
so you get that x=.8s and that is the answer and this makes sense since it is less than the speed of light.

He's retired now and out of the game so I'm sure there IS an answer, we just don't know it. (I'm a science enthusiast, payed attention in A.P. Physics in high school, that's the extent of my education)

Gravity is a universal 9.8 m/s^2. In order for us to stay on this planet (at the equator) that 9.8 m/s^2 would have to be in balance against the acceleration of earth's rotation at the equator, which I understand from some basic trig to be a=v^2/r ---&gt;  (2*pi*r/T)^2/r
So of course your acceleration will change depending on radius - at the equator, a larger radius, at the 45 degree latitude, a smaller radius. This is the extent of my knowledge (using the internet to cheat a little) and my understanding is this:

At the equator your acceleration is slower, but more force is being exerted on you (like swinging a stone tied to the end of a rope); at/near the poles your acceleration is faster (right?) but less force is exerted on you (swinging a stone with a rope of 1m length, then pulling the rope in to you mid swing reduces force and increases acceleration, does that apply here?)... So my question is **Why don't we feel gravity's pull more at the poles? Or, inversely, why don't we fly off the earth standing near the equator?** If I stand on a scale at the equator with gravity pulling a uniform 9.8 m/s^2 on me and weight 165 lbs, then at a pole with gravity being uniform but less 'outward' force being exerted on me, gravity should 'win' a little stronger, pulling me down on the scale more (more perceived 'weight'). **Why doesn't it?

There are three 1920's era buildings that look like they were built slightly off the ground.

This afternoon I noticed that there were two adolescent rabbits with almost all white white fur and one older looking rabbit with black fur.

http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/relativ/tdil.html

Those are the two websites I used. The second is useful for actually plugging numbers into the equation. Using the Lorentz Transformation I found the seconds at near speed of light velocity per stationary second ratio for several different velocities.

0.2C - 1.02062

0.4C - 1.091089

0.6C - 1.25

0.8C - 1.666666

0.9C - 2.294157

0.999C - 22.36627

0.99999C - 223.6073

This would suggest someone stationary would age 223.6073 times faster than someone traveling at a relative velocity of 0.99999C.
A person traveling at slightly under 2.998x10^8 m/s (0.99999C) knows that he is going at that speed because his instruments tell him so. But he also knows that the time he experiences is 223.6073 times slower than what a relatively stationary observer experiences. Is he wrong to assume the velocity a stationary person would observe is 2.998x10^8 meters per 223.6073 seconds? That's only 1340743.348 m/s. This still follows the model that if you could watch someone fall into a black hole they would speed up and up and then eventually slow down to a point where they are not moving as time goes infinitely slower for them relative to you. 

Here are what the original velocities would look like from a stationary perspective:

0.2C / 1.02062 = 0.19595C

0.4C / 1.091089 = 0.366606C

0.6C / 1.25 = 0.48C

0.8C / 1.666666 = 0.48C

0.9C / 2.294157 = 0.392300C

0.99C / 7.088812 = 0.1396566C

This continues to fit the speed up and then slow down black hole model. Someone going 0.2C will appear to go faster than someone going 0.99C from a relatively stationary perspective. If more calculation between the 0.6 and 0.8 are done the data shows that a space traveler can reach about 0.75C (from his perspective) before a stationary observer starts to sees him slow down. Because the time (at velocity) and time (stationary) ratio for 0.75C is 1.511857 a stationary observer would only perceive the 0.75C as slightly under 0.5C.

I am calling in the big guns to help me answer a friend's physics question homework.  I haven't taken kinematics in awhile so I am a bit rusty so I will detail the question out, there is no diagram.  I spent literally like 40 minutes on this question and this is as far as I got.  See question below. 



An automobile enters a constant 90 meter radius of curvature turn traveling at 25 m/s north and exits the curve traveling east.  The car completes the turn in 5.4 seconds.  Assume the speed of the car can be modeled as a quadratic function of time.  


Ok so here is what I did.  

I modeled the velocity equation, (the professor told us that the function of speed and velocity can be used interchangably).  We are required to figure out initial and final values of arc length, velocity, acceleration, angular velocity, and angular acceleration. 

v(t) = a(t)^2 + bt + c

plugged in initial conditions t(0)
and simplified the velocity function to 

v(t) = a(t)^2 + bt + 25

so for the final value of velocity equation I have

v(5.4) = a(5.4)^2 + (5.4)t + 25

I used derivation to figure out the function for acceleration which I got to be: (ac is acceleration since a is already used)

ac(t) = 2at+b 

and using initial conditions I found the initial acceleration equal to:

ac(0) = b 

and final value of acceleration to be 

ac(5.4) = 10.8+b

and finally I used integration of the velocity function to get the function or arc length equal to (I used the equation s = r(x) where x is equal to theta, s = arc length and r = radius, in radians to figure out arc length)


90s(t) = a(t)^3 /  3 + b^2 /   2 +25t.

Using initial conditions I simplified initial arc length to 0 and final arc length to be equal to 



52.488a + 14.58b = 70.686 after simplifying by figuring out final arc length to be 70.686 by using trigonomtery to figure out that the car did an exact quarter of a circle arc.

And that is as far as I got, I have 3 equations with 4 unknowns and no idea how to figure out the rest of the data.   

Any help would be greatly appreciated, time is a issue here, it is due in about 6 hours.

I've always been told that we smell things through ligand-receptor interactions.

The binding interaction then sets off a signal transduction chain to you brain, giving you the sensation of smelling an orange.

So my question is, how did the receptor(s) in my example 'get there' so to speak? Are there a variety of 'default' receptors/smells? I can see the evolutionary advantage of this, but what about artificial smells, like 'birthday cake', or 'new car' or some kind of perfume? Are these sensations simply the combined triggering of multiple receptors simultaneously?

Or are new receptors produced in response to new compounds -similarly to how new antibodies are produced?

I'll try and keep this succinct and don't make fun of my ship.

My first attempt at doing this was to watch the meters (up top in the screenshot). Now I would try and keep the throttle low to avoid wasting fuel while climbing in meters, but this didn't work.

Second attempt I realized if I watched the meters and got to orbit (something like 100k meters?) the ship would continue without much fuel after a certain point. This worked and the meters did continue to climb high, but I fell back to earth shortly after. Again I tried to conserve fuel during this.

My third attempt I've given up on paying attention to the meters. What I look at now is where it says ""Surface 36.2m/s"". This climbs when the throttle is almost at full blast. It wouldn't climb as quickly when I would play with the throttle to conserve fuel. BUT! The meters did continue to climb in my first and second attempts.

Now why does it work to just blast off and fly full throttle?

&gt; Krauss points out that measurements can affect the outcome of the system. He suggests that our measurements of supernovae in 1998, which detected the existence of dark energy, may have reset the false vacuum's decay clock to zero, switching it back to the fast decay regime, and greatly decreasing the universe's chance of surviving. ""In short, we may have snatched away the possibility of long-term survival for our universe and made it more likely it will decay,"" says Krauss.

&gt; How could something like this possibly happen? In quantum mechanics, there is an effect known as the quantum Zeno effect—an oddity of the quantum world that suggests a system can be kept in an excited state simply by repeated measurements. This can be described using a quantum system initially in state 'A'. After time begins, the system wants to decay to state 'B' but, before it reaches state 'B', it will exist as a superposition of states 'A' and 'B'. If one measures the system shortly after it begins, it would have a high probability of collapsing entirely to state 'A' again, essentially resetting the system's internal quantum clock. Krauss is suggesting that, by observing the dark energy, we reset the internal quantum clock of the false vacuum universe, and that may have caused it to return to a point before it has switched from the fast decay to the slow decay—in the process greatly reducing the universe's ultimate chance of survival.


Does the number of observers matter? Do more observers increase the probability of the system collapsing back to the initial state?

I live in Cairo, Egypt, where [15% of our electricty comes from hydro-power from the Aswan Dam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aswan_High_Dam#Electricity_production). This counts for clean energy, right? So perhaps we only need to offset 85% of the x KWHs

Also, **how about my car? Shouldn't this be easier to calculate? Assuming again, I consume y litres of fuel per month (98 octane un-leaded), how much trees are needed to offset that carbon emission**

PS: I KNOW this is not going to have an exact answer, since there is a HUGE variation in what defines a 'tree' either by species, age of tree itself, condition etc... I just wanted to know if there was a way to calculate a round figure

PPS: if there was a way to convert trees to house-plants, that would be SUPER awesome. I know this would never be plausible, but when I can visualise things, it gives me a nice way to wrap my head around it

Is it that g is just a useful approximation and the rate of acceleration actually accelerates as two massive bodies approach each other because I'm guessing that an object close to the surface of jupiter would accelerate towards jupiter faster than 9.8m/s^2.

* the Petlier effect turns electric current to heat (at the junction of two different metals with current through them, depending on their Petlier coefficients they will accumulate/dissipate heat at the junctions, creating a temperature gradient)

* the Seebeck effect takes temperature gradients and turns them into electric current (two metals joined in a circuit at two different junctions, temperature difference at junctions will drive current via hot -&gt; cold like classical gas, separation of charges = E field)

Escape velocity on earth is about 11.186 km/s or 40270 km/h. If we could propel something from the surface of the earth in that speed it can effectively enter orbit. (excluding air resistance) Why can't we ""simply"" build a container, and power the acceleration by electro magnetism (essentially building a rail gun **but circular**): have the container accelerate around a loop in a **circular track** with vacuum for no air resistance and maglev for no ground resistance ([why not make it superconducting?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EYwHVI0K3E)). When the container reaches the required speed the track is switched to a ramp that gives the container a launch angle up in the air. This can be a 500m vertical track against a building to make sure it encounters as little atmosphere as possible.

How much time would it take? Let's say we can accelerate the container by 5 m/s^2, then it would take us 40 minutes to acquire the required speed (add perhaps 10% for friction).

How much money would it cost? (Please confirm that these calculations are accurate.) If the container weighs 1000 kg and we would accelerate it to the required speed (11186 m/s) for one second (to make the calculations simple as the time is irrelevant) we need 1000 * 11186 * 2 N of force. The total distance traveled would be 11186 / 2 meter assuming linear acceleration = 5593 m. (1000 * 11186 * 2 N) * 5593 m = about 125 GJ which is 125 GWs (since the acceleration was 1 second) which becomes 34 MWh. With an energy price of 0.11 $/kWh the total energy cost is 4000$ or 4$ per kg. Compare that to current estimations of $22,000/kg for rocket propelled material.

Is the scale realistic? The G force limits us from sending fragile material - it's essentially v^2 / r / g where v is a maximum of 11186 m/s. If we limit ourself to 1000 G which I suppose is a reasonable limit for electronics to not break (?) the minimum radius must be v^2 / r / g=1000 &lt;=&gt; v^2 / 1000 / g = r &lt;=&gt; r = 12736 m ~ 13 km, about 3 times larger than the LHC (~4.3 km radius).

It could be expensive/difficult to counter for the force of a 1 tonne vehicle in that speed but that can be adjusted by limiting the size to 100 kg which is still useful to send smaller module packets/material pieces. A smaller vehicle would also encounter less air resistance when entering the atmosphere.

This construction would require no additional technology or exotic materials that we don't today (unlike space elevators) and the scale of the construction is realistic (unlike the ""launch loop"") (I think?)

Askscience: Are my calculations wrong? How much would the air resistance in the atmosphere affect the launch speed and ruin this idea? What makes this idea unrealistic/science fiction?

Thanks.

I have two conflicting schools of thought on this.  Living in New England, this matters!  Florida, I would guess not so much.

**Thought #1:**  It is best operate the filter pump during the height and heat of the day (let's say 11am-4pm) which will allow the skimmer to pull the sun warmed water thru the system.  Then, point the (single) near surface return slightly downward to dispense the warmed water back to the pool.

**Thought #2:**  It is best to allow the sun to maximally heat the surface water with as little disturbance as possible (zero ""stirring"") and run the filter pump *after* the heat of the day has had a chance to maximally increase the surface temperature (let's say 3pm-8pm).

In all cases, I would think the smart move would be to avoid any circulation of the pool water during the night?  I have a plastic  ""Skim-it"" device which increases the reach of the skimmer to pull 24"" of surface water in.  Mainly this effectively pulls leaves and surface debris out, but I imagine that this device would help with the gathering of the warmer surface water.  

In case it matters, here are the specifics: The pool is a 20,000 gallon rectangular inground with an 8' hopper depth.  The N-S dimension is 32' and the E-W dimension is 16'.  Surface skimmer near the center of the east side and water return located near the northwest corner. Return is currently set up to point slightly downward (to minimize surface waves/ripples that could possibly reflect or bounce sunlight) and return allows for a clockwise circulation.  It gets direct sunlight from 10am to 7pm for most of the summer.  We re-lined the pool a few years ago with a darker blue vinyl color, so no thermal gain or loss from materials like gunite or concrete.  No bubble cover or other thermal blanket is used.

* Do they derive their speed mostly from energy (kinetic or otherwise), or from fundamental forces acting on them?
* Why isn't the speed of light faster or slower?
* Is there something that the speed of light can be compared to in the manner that we compare meters to centimeters, etc.? In other words, is the speed of light an independent constant upon which no other cosmic variables act?

We all know that the speed of light is generally accepted to be approximately 300km/s, and that to an observer only the wavelength changes due to relative speed. IE. redshift. 

How then does the speed of light apparently change during refraction when light passes through different mediums such as vacuum and diamond? Secondly, if we were somehow able to measure the speed of light from within the diamond medium would we see 300km/s or the mere 40% which observation of refraction leads us to believe?

**QUESTION**

IN SPACE, Would a ship equipped with modern day projectile-firing weapons really be completely useless against a ship using directed-energy weapons?
___

**BACKGROUND**

It seems that every show, film, and story written about future conflicts every person and ship is using direct-energy weaponry(""plasma cannons"", ""photon torpedoes"" and ""phasers"") So I got to wondering, ""how much more effective would these weapons really be in space vs. our current projectiles?""
___

**SCENARIO**
 To help you guys answer this question I'm going to present a scenario so you can compare the weaponry and make a conclusion based on the situation presented and the science behind the weapons. I am not a scientist, not even a college student. I'm just a dude with a curious mind. If the weapons I equip to the ships don't lend themselves to a good scientific discussion see the TL;DR at the bottom.


* *BOTH SHIPS HAVE THE SAME MANEUVERABILITY, SPEED AND SHIELDS*
* *The ships are not moving at great speeds. They are only moving as fast as needed to maneuver around one another.*

***The statistics for the weapons are based on how they perform on earth. Speed and range for instance, will be greatly effected in a space environment ***

* **SHIP #2 (THE NARWHAL)**
___

The information for these weapons is kind of limted but I will include a short description of the weapon and the amount of each the ship is equipped with. 
**The Narwhal** is powered by a nuclear reactor much like a nuclear submarine. For the sake of argument the power supply of **The Narwhal** will run at full power for as long as **The Redditor** has ammunition.

* **ARMAMENT**

* **[Electrolaser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolaser)(front-mounted)**
&gt; An electrolaser is a type of electroshock weapon which is also a directed-energy weapon. It uses lasers to form an electrically conductive laser-induced plasma channel (LIPC). A fraction of a second later, a powerful electric current is sent down this plasma channel and delivered to the target, thus functioning overall as a large-scale, high energy, long-distance version of the Taser electroshock gun.&gt;
Alternating current is sent through a series of step-up transformers, increasing the voltage and decreasing the current. The final voltage may be between 108 and 109 volts.[citation needed] This current is fed into the plasma channel created by the laser beam.
* **[Pulsed Energy Projectile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsed_Energy_Projectile)(2 forward-facing side-mounted)**
&gt;Pulsed Energy Projectile or PEP systems emit an infrared laser pulse which creates rapidly expanding plasma at the target. The resulting sound, shock and electromagnetic waves stun the target and cause pain and temporary paralysis. The weapon would be used to shock, shake or stun the ship.
* **[MARAUDER](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARAUDER)(One plasma cannon)**
&gt;&gt;a beam, bolt, or stream of plasma, which is an excited state of matter consisting of atomic electrons &amp; nuclei and free electrons if ionized, or other particles if pinched.


**SPEED OF DIRECTED ENERGY WEAPONS**
&gt;&gt;The speed of the energy weapon is determined by the density of the beam. If it is very dense then it is very powerful, but a particle beam moves much slower than the speed of light. Its speed is determined by mass, power, density, or particle/energy density.




**TL;DR:** In space where projectiles are not inhibited by gravity or wind resistance, bullets and missiles should be able to reach magnificent speeds and travel outstanding distances. With the increased speed and distance the bullets should deliver more damage to the target upon impact. Would this benefit gained by a space environment make up for the projectiles inferiority to directed-energy weapons such as lasers and plasma canons?",,,,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,default,In a hypothetical space battle would our projectile-fired weaponry really be completely useless against directed energy weapons?(THIS ONE'S GOING TO GET COMPLICATED),,,,http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/r4kla/in_a_hypothetical_space_battle_would_our/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,

Now, this seems problematic to me when thinking about relativistic mechanics because it seems to pick out a preferred notion of simultaneity. What is the geometry of the phase space of multiple particles in a relativistic framework? How do you incorporate the Lorentzian structure?

My two guesses are: You could look at a manifold that has a dimension corresponding to time, so the space of world lines instead of phase space.

It would look like the plane was bent upward in a warped sphere, and by looking up at 45^o you could see the horizon, the furthest place on the plane that is visible to you (a circle around you of radius 32.9 lightyears).

It *seems* like my brain is reacting in the same way that it would have if this had happened in reality.

So my question is: does the brain fundamentally (I suppose: physiologically) distinguish between experiences that happen in dreams and experiences that happen while awake? I know that, *consciously*, it does; but that usually involves saying to oneself: ""No, that was just a dream.""

I've heard all sorts of theories about the beneficial function of dreaming, e.g. along the lines of training/preparing oneself for certain situations. So my follow-up question would be: what are the dominant theories on the function(s) of dreaming? Or is it just an accidental mess of firing neurons that may or may not have coincidental benefits?

I am trying to refute my professors argument that these beings are super-intelligent extra terrestrials. I've chosen to attack the idea of brain size having no correlation to intelligence and I am getting somewhere but I need a little bit of help. From what I've been reading in my research, a majority of the brain is not even used for cognition but rather regulation of bodily functions. Therefore, my theory is that these creatures had immense brains which demanded a lot of our bodies resources. Their large brains were used mainly to regulate and maintain their bodies, and the reason they no longer exist is because they either evolved into creatures with smaller brains(and ones who allocated more of their resources to cognition) or were extinct because they required a large amount of nutrients which they could not provide for themselves. I would love to see reddits arguments against my professors. Below I posted his argument he gave to us.

1.	Conehead skulls are not the result of skull binding and body modification. (Discussed in class.)
2.	Conehead skulls have up to three times more cranial capacity (ccm) than Homo sapiens sapiens  (but conehead is usually only 1.5-2.5x larger than H. s. sapiens, and this is course much larger than contemporary skull binders, who only have a human-level of cranial capacity).
3.	If we can rely on a brain-size / body-weight ratio as some sort of rough indicator of intelligence,  the large cranial cavity ccm of conehead implies enormous brain size for the coneheads (since creatures with a brain cavity fill it for brains). 
4.	(Following from 3) Ultra-large cranial capacity and brain-size (relative to the brain size ratio to body weight) would imply conehead exhibited a super-intelligence / super-consciousness, orders of magnitude greater than humans, likely beyond understanding. 
5.	(Following from 4) Any creature with an intelligence of this sort is not earth-bound and thus resembles a non-Earthling.  
∴  Coneheads are extraterrestrials.

Below is our current research. 

The following data pertains to the mechanics of maglev trains

Magnetic levitation trains, or maglev trains, by having magnets create force between the rail and trains to provide lift. Due to the fact that contact friction is not present in a maglev system, the trains can go on very high speeds (roughly 139 mph to 156 mph). For instance, Shanghai’s Pudong-Airport-to-City line takes about 8 minutes to travel 30 km. The tracks maglev trains are called guideways due to the fact that the trains never touch the tracks; they are only guided by them. The two main types of maglev trains are electromagnetic and electrodynamic. Electromagnetic systems attract, while electrodynamic systems repel.
The Electrodynamic maglevs can attain speeds of 340 miles by using super conductor magnets cool by liquid helium. While the train moves on wheels. It creates a current on the sides of the guideway and lifts the train for it to run faster. Something similar to a airplane. An electromagnetic maglev can attain speeds of 310, close to the Electrodynamic maglev.  The way that these trains work is by having electromagnets on the bottom of the train in a C shaped bar. Then the magnets push the train up by being attracted to the railroad. Though in japan the new railway going from Tokyo to Osaka (450-km, 270-miles). But this train would not be open to public after 2025. This shows that these types of trains do take a while to build and cost more than a new high speed with wheels train.
The way that these trains are moved is either by a linear synchronous motor or a linear induction motor. Linear synchronous motor uses coils in the guideway that carries electric currents and push the train forward. Because of this the train moves at a constant speed even up hill. The linear induction motor works exactly the same but the coils are put on the train instead of the guideway.
Linear electric motor generates motion along the guideway. There are 2 parts to the rotary motor called the stator and the inner moving part called the rotor. In some designs the stator is the moving part and the rotor is the stationary one.
The following data pertains to the economics related to maglev trains.

In today’s world, Amtrak (America’s only real operating inter-city passenger rail system) is a very inefficient and broken system for travel when compared to other systems in the world. It is government run, and despite low ticket costs, when put up against other forms of travel it is still too slow and inconvenient to travelers to be viable against something like air travel.
Maglev operating costs will be only 3 cents per passenger mile and 7 cents per ton mile, compared to 15 cents per passenger mile for airplanes, and 30 cents per ton mile for trucks or buses. This shows an obvious advantage in efficiency Maglev tracks can last for 50 years or even longer with low maintenance, because there is no contact and wear, and because the vehicle loads are uniformly distributed, rather than concentrated at wheels. Similarly, Maglev vehicles will have much longer lifetimes than autos, trucks, and airplanes.
The United States has a 8.5 unemployment rate with 13.1 people out of jobs currently.
It takes a projected 2 hours and 54 minutes to travel from Boston to Baltimore on maglev trains, compared to 2 hours and 20 minutes traveling from and to the same destination on an airplane (sans check-in), 7 hours and 5 minutes traveling to and from the same destinations on Amtrak, and 7 hours and 6 minutes traveling to and from the same destinations in an average car.
The following data pertains to the environmental issues relating to our project

When they consume electricity, no pollution is emitted. Even if they use electricity from coal or natural-gas-fired power plants, the resulting CO2 emission is much less than that from autos, trucks, and airplanes, because of Maglev’s very high energy efficiency.
Maglev train systems only produce 0.47 pounds of CO2 emissions per passenger mile, while airplanes produce 1.06 pounds of CO2 emissions per passenger mile, and the average automobile produces 0.77 pounds of CO2 passenger emissions.
Maglev train systems only use 1180 Btu of energy per passenger mile, while air planes use 3264 Btu of energy per passenger mile, and cars use 3445 Btu of energy per passenger mile.

Alright, so the assignment is that we have to write a story, and the following are the requirements that we have to have in our story, I am going to write the question and the answer. Please tell me if any of them are wrong. 

1) A character must discuss how electrons make a magnetic field 
A: A current is a flow of charge (by definition) which an electron has a charge. When it moves, it is a current. Currents generate magnetic fields in much the same way that moving magnetic fields generate a electromotive force.

2) A character must discuss the three parts of an atom, to tell another character how to read this information from the periodic table. 
A: An atom looks like the sun with the planets spinning around it. The center is called the nucleus. It is made of tiny protons and neutrons. Electrons move around the nucleus far from the nucleus. When an atom is in balance, it has the same number of protons and electrons. It can have a different number of neutrons. Protons and electrons are attracted to each other. Protons have a positive charge (+) and electrons have a negative charge (–). Opposite charges attract each other. Reading the periodic table: The atomic number (above the symbol representing the element) is the equal number of protons in the nucleus as well as the number of electrons in the electron cloud. The Symbol is a one or two letter abbreviation derived from the elements English or Latin name. The atomic mass (Located below the name of the element) is the weighed average masses of all the elements isotopes. An isotope is each of two or more forms of the same element that contain equal numbers of protons but different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei, and hence differ in relative atomic mass but not in chemical properties; in particular, a radioactive form of an element. 

3) A character must build a generator, that will also solve a major problem in the story. 
A: (Materials) A magnet, something that spins ( I dunno what that something is?) and a coil of wire. 
The generator will fix a power outage. 

4) A character must build an electric motor, must also solve a major problem. 
A: Same materials as the generator but with current flowing the opposite way. 
It will be used as a car motor. (I think I can use it as a car motor?) 

5) You must solve one F=MA problem for any variable of your choice.
A: Solving for force 
120KG x 333 M/S^ = 39,960N

6) You must solve one D=TV problem for ant variable of your choice. 
A: Solving for time  
5,000 Meters / 4 M/S = 1250 Seconds 

7) You must have a character explain to another character why the North Magnetic Pole of the earth is actually in the southern hemisphere. 
A: When you look at a compass there are two sides, North and South. The North side of the magnet is attracted to the South side of the southern magnetic pole of the earth because opposites attract. The needle points North but the magnetic field is south.

I figure I could get a rough calculation if I had some good physics data on skulls, but so far I can't find any.

If we assume a 1.9g round moving at about 250 m/s, that gives us approximately 60 J of kinetic energy being delivered by something with a cross-section of about 6 mm. Obviously it would depend on a lot  factors such as the angle of impact and the location on the skull, but I can't imagine it would be too difficult to get some rough estimates.

Lately in biology we've been talking about a little bit of DNA, Punnet squares, hereditary family trees and such in preparation for state tests. But while I was working on one of the Punnet square questions I started thinking about something. Normally, at least just using a Punnet square, and having a male and a female, XX and XY are the only two possible outcomes.(Though I am aware that XXY, XYY XXYY, are somehow, also possible, but very much out of what I understand) But anyway. I'm also aware that it is possible for homosexual couples to also have babies, with the help of technology of course. Now, if there are two women, with normal chromosomes, shouldn't they generally only be able to conceive girls? What about two men? They have XX on one square, XY on two, ...and then there's YY. Again, my knowledge is currently, pretty meager, and I know that genetics are so much more complex than just Punnet squares, and I'm hoping we do actually get into this type of stuff after state tests are done. But I imagine that could be awhile. So tell me, is this actually at all possible, considering the situation, and what could this cause?

This is something of an uneducated prediction of future problems in low-gravity environments, and I am somewhat fascinated with that concept.

Today, we can still see the tracks left by the LRV on Apollo 15 ([See here](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2012/03/lro_apollo15_2011.jpg)), due to the lack of strong gravity, wind, and other forces which cause erosion on Earth.

This led me to the idea that if humans spent extensive amounts of time on the surface of the moon, would the movement of vehicles (such as the LRV) eventually carve out massive ruts from driving in the same place over and over? On Earth, vehicles driving through the dirt repeatedly will create a path, but this path will ultimately stay relatively flat(ish) due to erosion. 

On the moon, if a vehicle(s) drive repeatedly over the same path from point A to point B, won't they slowly dig the path far down into the ground, requiring the need for makeshift roads or at the very least filling in the holes?

Between some Neil deGrasse Tyson, Ph.D. memes and Carl Sagan quotes, I get a little miffed when average joe's use generalities of science to de-bunk whole concepts oh which science has yet to be able to address (ie stuff using affective data collection techniques).


Today a friend on FB shared this quote: 
""There's another reason I think popularizing science is important, why I try to do it. It's a foreboding I have -- maybe ill-placed -- of an America in my children's generation, or my grandchildren's generation, when all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when we're a service and information-processing economy; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest even grasps the issues; when the people (by ""the people"" I mean the broad population in a democracy) have lost the ability to set their own agendas, or even to knowledgeably question those who do set the agendas; when there is no practice in questioning those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and religiously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in steep decline, unable to distinguish between what's true and what feels good, we slide, almost without noticing, into superstition and darkness."" - Carl Sagan (The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark)


I just had to chime in. First, I'll say I believe science needs to be widespread and in ~everyone's~ daily lives. I was raised by a Geologist and a Chemist, I was raised with science as my primary definitive concept of the world. Maybe that's why I feel like so many people miss the boat on science. Science doesn't inherently prove there is no god/s, nor de-bunk astrology nor find that energies do -not- exist. Meh. Any who, I'll just post my response to his posted quote here:


""We also ""slide, almost without noticing, into superstition and darkness"" when we do -not- question the science &amp; researchers whom came before us. Nothing in science is truly fact, rule nor law. The very basic concepts of science tells us this. ALL of EVERYTHING can be changed with new information, new data. Just because we haven't built ABC data detection tool yet doesn't mean XYZ doesn't exist. Also, as most recently found (by scientists), our ability to perceive, receive and collect new data is determined by how we look and ~why~ we look. The very outcome is affected by watching. Let us not so quickly discard centuries of human activity because a few lab folks narrowed something down and vice versa, let us move forward with every bit of new data found."" - Me

Doing some simple calculations, we find that F = qv x B = ma =&gt; a = F/m. For a proton, m being 1.67*10^(-27) kg and the force calculatd being on the order of ~10^(-14) N, this number comes out to around 10^12 ~ 10^13 m/s^2. The problem goes on to ask a few other related values.

How does this make sense physically? *c* is 3 * 10^8 m/s, so how can a proton in a (relatively weak!) magnetic field have acceleration that would imply it goes superluminal in less than one second?

We have a vehicle with mass of 2 kg.
We accelerate the vehicle from 0 m/s to 10 m/s (ignoring friction). The energy needed for this is 0.5 * 2 * 10^2 = 100 J.

Case 2:
Same vehicle.
We accelerate it from 0 m/s to 5 m/s for a cost of 25 J. We then change the coordinate system so that it moves 5 m/s relative to the old one, accelerate the vehicle from 0 m/s to 5 m/s again (25 J), and change back to the old coordinate system.
The car now has a speed of 10 m/s but the total cost to accelerate it was only 50 J.

By changing the coordinate system more often as we accelerate the energy needed to get the vehicle from 0 m/s to 10 m/s can be reduced to an arbitrarily small amount.

My friend and I have encountered a mathematical conundrum. We are high school students in AP Calculus, and we today were learning about infinite series in class. One of the examples in our book was as follows:
NOTE: I'm not quite sure how to do sigma notation on here, so please bear with me

(infinity)
____
\         (-1)^n+1 * 1/n
/                          
-----
n = 1

This equals 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 ... which converges to ln 2.

However, by rearranging the numbers, it is possible to obtain:

(1 - 1/2) - 1/4 + (1/3 - 1/6) - 1/8 + (1/5 - 1/10) - 1/12 + (1/7 - 1/14) ...

which equals:
1/2 -1/4 + 1/6 - 1/8 + 1/10 - 1/12 + 1/14...

Pulling out a common factor of 1/2, we get:
1/2 (1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 - 1/6 + 1/7...) = 1/2 ln(2).

Note that since these are the same terms as before, just in a different order, they are equal. Therefore (supposedly):
ln(2) = 1/2 ln(2).
In the sidebar, it said that Georg Riemann proved that if a series is conditionally convergent (like this one), the terms can be rearranged to produce any real number S as its sum. By extension, this implies that every real number is equal to every other real number. When we approached our teacher about this, he was stumped. As were 5 other math teachers that we asked.

Reddit, please help me. What is going on here? Why does this happen? Are we making an invalid logical jump somewhere?

Most of you who know what you're talking about have probably heard the problem that goes something like ""if I had a rod that was 1/10/however many light-years long, could I push my end and have their end move instantly, thereby causing information to be transmitted faster than light speed?""

I understand the basic, normal answer, that every known material is compressible and pushing it would send a compression wave that would take time to travel, but I read this answer and was not satisfied:

""Every solid has a certain speed of sound. For example, the speed of sound in steel is about 4.5 km/s. In diamond, it's about 17 km/s. [...] If you pull or tap on one end of your ruler made of steel, the material will be stretched or compressed in a wave which will travel to the other end at about 4.5 km/s. The wave will reach the other end in about 666,667 years. If the ruler is a perfect diamond, it might take only 17,647 years.""

I am perfectly clear up to this point, but then he continues:

""If you postulate the existence of a material with zero density and infinite compression modulus, the wave will propagate at the speed of light and reach the other end in one year [assuming we have a rod with length one light-year].""

If the compression modulus is infinite how is any wave formed to then propagate? Why would this not be instant, and why would a wave that does form travel the speed of light?

1) In prehistory, I suppose ""caveman"" times, did these cavemen/women ""brush"" their teeth? I am imagining that they used a twig or something; I mean, I KNOW they didn't have brushes- I'm curious more about dental maintenance.

2) Do we have evidence of any such implements that we KNOW were used for these purposes? I mean, if they used twigs, then obviously not.  I'm more curious about a record of dental care.

3) If we (in modern times) do not maintain our mouth care, we get cavities, have to have root canals, get abscesses, etc.  Did prehistoric humans just walk around in constant mouth pain from mouth ailments? (Again, I know that these individuals did not have a diet of Mountain Dew, Twinkies, hard candy, and sugary foods, which obviously can lead to more cavities and such; I'm not concerned about the diet.  I'm more concerned about how they cared for these ailments and how often they may have gotten them.)

Finally, evolutionary wise, did prehistoric humans have different teeth than modern humans? I know they were different shaped, and that they may have had a different number of different teeth; but were they more ""durable (?)"" or have thicker enamels/root designs?  And how do our (modern) teeth compare to those of prehistoric humans and those of other mammals closely (DNA wise) related to us?

And yet, if you fry up some vegetables and season half with potassium chloride and the other half with sodium chloride, and do a taste test, close to 100% will be repulsed by the vegetables seasoned with potassium chloride and will gobble down the veggie seasoned with sodium chloride. 

WHY?

Why would we evolve to be repulsed by the taste of one electrolyte we really really need. And yet crave another electrolyte we also need? it just doesn't make sense to me.

After 31 months, they found that compared to the homes which still used table salt (NaCl) in their kitchens, in the homes where a salt mixture with equal amounts of potassium and sodium had been substituted for NaCl, there was a statistically significant:

39% drop in cardiovascular disease
70% decrease in heart failure
50% decrease in cerebral vascular disease
and a 25% drop (though not statistically significant) in diabetes (which I had predicted in the 1980’s).

An important aspect of this study is the fact that the K/Na ratio in the salt replacement was only 1/1.

Is the time it takes for the light to slow down not significant or does light just instantaneously change speeds with no acceleration or deceleration?",,,,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,self,Does light accelerate/decelerate as it passes through different objects?,,,,http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/pb1oa/does_light_acceleratedecelerate_as_it_passes/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1325269887.0,{},,,,,

So, I have dabbled in reading in philosophy, psychology, physics, astronomy, etc. Nothing specific to where I could apply it. Well, maybe besides the philosophy and psychology to an extent. I was watching [Athene's Theory of Everything](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbh5l0b2-0o&amp;feature=related) Which I don't really know who this guy is, but from quick google search he seems like some gamer? I don't know; I must be out of this loop. I imagine he didn't create this theory but rather posted it. Anyway, during some point in this video I just thought. Wow, I really wish more of my friends who are all confused about life and depressed or unhappy or just my friends who are happy and love life would take the time to learn more about existence, psychology, or at least take the time to understand why they do the things they do. I believe everyone should posses knowledge on how their brains work, ways you can modify your behaviors, or just becoming more self-aware. Not saying by watching this video I myself became self-aware, or maybe I did, I am posting this post asking for advice so something happened.

My second thought is what is the best way I can share this with friends, and get them to at least catch their attention? It irritates me to say that Facebook was my first option, all my friends are on facebook, and I am not really involved in any other social networking, I really have no need to tweet or tumble around aimlessly, whatever. Maybe at a later date as I understand their value in getting info out there in certain situations. 


**Actual Question**

What I am asking is, what subject(s) should I focus on? I am hoping to get an opinion from someone who currently does what I want to do.
I don't necessarily want to be a psychologist who listens to peoples problems only to give them responses on how to change their behavior. I want to share the information and if people respond to it I would gladly discuss it with them. Does that make sense? Like If I just traveled around and gave lectures to people about this stuff I would be a fucking happy camper, this is what I am imagining so I think that would be cool; which could obviously differ but just putting that out there.
What I want to do is to be able to efficiently explain to people how their brains work, their behaviors, a lot of the stuff mentioned in this video, neurological wise. I want to be an expert in this. Right now I am some guy working at a family owned pizza parlor. I want to be that guy who teaches you cool stuff about yourself to willing listeners. Not people who when I tell them seem disinterested to even ponder it. I am currently not good at explaining things to people, perhaps it is because of my lack of understanding of the subjects since I only know general information. 

I know what subjects I should study, psychology neuroscience, etc. But those are just broad words to me right now. I'm thinking specifics.

La de frickin' da. It kind of sounds like I want to be a traveling motivational speaker. Living in a van down by THE RIVER!

Eyesight seems to be a trait inherited through genetics (Correct me if i'm wrong on this.), as it seems that people whose parents have poor eyesight are much more likely to end up wearing glasses/contacts/etc.
I imagine that not being able to see clearly ten feet in front of you would have been a severe disadvantage when in any kind of conflict, or even living in general.

My question(s):
How big a role did poor eyesight play while we were evolving from previous ancestors?
Why is it so common in our species despite being an obvious severe disadvantage, really no matter how you look it?

When I was a kid in the mid-1990's, my very Catholic grandmother took me on a pilgrimage to Conyers, GA. Apparently, some lady here was having apparitions of Jesus and delivering messages. Most of my life, I've regarded what happened there as pretty silly. From what I remember, a bunch of weird stuff happened, for example: there was a statue of Jesus that you could feel a heartbeat when you placed your hand on it. There was also a statue that started bleeding, etc. Just weird stuff that, in retrospect, I deemed a fake scam for money. However, here's the one I've never been able to make sense of. Before the apparition arrived, everyone was taking pictures of the sun. So, we took out our polaroid, and we took one too. I recently visited my grandma (who now has very late stage Alzheimers), and [I found the photo](http://imgur.com/NRgRf). Supposedly, it is the ""door to heaven"" right before Mary arrived. I've always thought of it as some kind of light trick, but how is that possible? After googling ""Conyer's apparitions,"" I found [others very similar to it](http://www.flickr.com/photos/36829113@N05/page3/).  Some people actually have pictures of the outline of Mary.

To my understanding, noise cancelling occurs when the incoming sound is inverted and used to cancel the noise with an antinoise signal by way of destructive interference. So why can't this effect be used by, say, a laptop? The mic could pick up the ambient sound, and then inverted and played on a headset.

Is this projectile motion?

I know that for an object to have projectile motion, there must be a constant velocity along one axis and constant acceleration along the other axis (for an object experiencing 2D motion). This constant acceleration is usually due to constant gravitation force. For example: a ball being thrown from a pitcher to a catcher experiences constant velocity in the horizontal direction and the force of gravity in the vertical direction.

The rocket is drifting freely in the y direction which means there is no applied force and it moves with a constant velocity. Then the rocket is trusted along the x direction with an acceleration of 15 m/s/s. This acceleration is not an external force on the rocket (like gravity would be). I know there is no or negligible gravity in space. 

So I guess my question is this: Does the constant acceleration of 15 m/s/s in the x direction cause the rocket to move in a straight path or will the rocket experience projectile motion by moving in a curved-like path?

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

As a baby, you obviously come ""equipped"" with the ability to learn and pronounce any sound the human mouth and voice box can, but as you age and depending on your first language, learning other languages as you get older becomes more difficult because there are certain sounds that your particular language doesn't use.

For example, English uses glides when pronouncing vowel sounds, whereas Japanese does not, and so being a native Japanese speaker trying to learn English, or vice versa, can leave a person with a strange sounding accent. Or I hear native French speakers have difficulty learning certain aspects of speaking English due to some similar issue.

So which language(s) learned early in life (say up to three languages) would best prepare one to learn any other language later in life? If one had a larger repertoire of previously mastered sounds to work from, would this decrease the likeliness of sounding foreign/having a thicker accent when learning the new language?

To clarify, I'm not ask whether learning Latin first will better help you learn and understand Latin-based languages, I'm referring specifically to the *sounds* made from the mouth that make up the languages themselves.

People in her family are now saying that she was holding on to make sure she saw her gran kids and after they had gone she had nothing left to wait for. 

My question is this, would she have actually known she was about to die even though she was told she has weeks left? (Saying goodbye to her husband of 60 years) 

Second question, is it possible for someone to 'hold on' as her family said about her waiting for her gran kids?

To expand on my question;

As I understand it, simplified, the amount of energy 'put into' an object in a given direction is equal to the change in kinetic energy of that object (i.e. if I put 25 joules of energy into a 1 kg object at rest, its velocity would now be 5 m/s), because the change in kinetic energy is m(vf^2 - vi^2 )/2, where vf = final velocity, and vi = initial velocity. I know this is rambling but I hope it made sense. 

Anywho, using the above kinetic energy equation, if we (very theoretically) put (1kg)(c^2 - 0^2 )/2 joules into a 1 kg object, it would accelerate to the speed of light.

But I'm also trying to make my story plausible. So, that means no faster-than-light travel, infinite energy sources, artificial gravity generators, etc. 

I want to take into account the travel time and gravity experienced by the occupants of a ship traveling from Earth to the Alpha Centauri star system (~4 light years away) in the mid-22nd century.

My early assumption was that the ship would travel at .2c, thus a travel time of 20 years. But after doing a bit of reading, that doesn't make any sense; the ship must, of course, accelerate. I am now assuming that the ship will constantly accelerate to the mid-point of the journey, turn around, and negatively accelerate until it reaches its destination. The question, then, is the value of acceleration.

For normal operations, a large section of the ship rotates to provide a 1G (9.81 m/s^2) centripetal force for the crew. But during interstellar transit, most of the occupants are in suspended animation/cryosleep/hibernation. Via the rotating section or engine acceleration, does the ship need to maintain an acceleration of 1G for the crew to remain healthy?

I suppose it depends on the ship's design; that is, whether the engines are located at the ""rear"" and the decks are located parallel to direction of travel, or the engines are at the ""bottom"", and the decks are perpendicular to direction of travel.

[According to this handy site](http://www.cthreepo.com/lab/math1.shtml), under ""Long Relativistic Journeys"", an acceleration of 1G and distance of 4.3LY would only take ~6 Earth years. That is dramatically shorter than what I had in mind for my story. Even halving it to 0.5G only takes 7.2 years. So is there a reason for the ship's acceleration to be so high, and in the future is that conceivable for something like a [nuclear-powered engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_rocket)?

At 0.1G, travel time is 13.6 years, which might work into the scale of the story a little better. According to that calculator, acceleration has to be taken down to .01G before travel time takes around 40 years. But at such low acceleration, would the crew become prone to effects of microgravity, or could the rotation section of the ship take care of that?

I want to make it feasible for us hard sci-fi nerds. I wish I had some more knowledge of physics to bring to the table, but I appreciate any discussion or help. Good day. :)

Students fill a graduated cylinder with water.  They then insert another tube, open at both ends, into the water.  By raising and lowering the open tube they can change the length of the pipe (which is a closed pipe due to the water at the bottom).  Using a tuning fork, they can create a wave inside the pipe and adjust the height until they hear a maximum at the first harmonic.  

Knowing that the first harmonic is Length of pipe = 1/4 wavelength for a closed pipe, they can find the total wavelength.  Combined with the frequency of the tuning fork, they can find velocity. 

My question comes from a correction presented in the lab.  According to the lab L=1/4lambda is not exactly correct, you have add a correction, L = 1/4*lambda + 2/5*diameter of the pipe.

Let's say I'm accelerating at a constant rate of 1 km/s^2 and my current speed is just 1000 km/s less than the speed of light. I'm being observed by someone from a fixed point in space. 


At this speed, the factor of change I'm feeling is roughly 12, meaning 1 hour to me is about 12 hours to the observer (Could be wrong on this, please tell if so). This means that although I'll still feel as if I'm accelerating at 1000 m/s^2, the observer will observe that I am accelerating at twelfth of that (~83 m/s^2).


I keep on accelerating until my speed is 1 km/s away from the speed of light, my factor of change is now just under 400. To me, I am still accelerating at 1000 m/s^2. To the observer, I am only accelerating at ~2.5 m/s^2.


Repeat until my acceleration to the observer approaches 0.


Some questions:


1) I only divided my acceleration by my factor of change. Will my velocity also be affected?


2) If I were to accelerate for 1000 seconds in my perspective (thus reaching the speed of light) then stop, would a near infinite amount of time have passed for the observer (with most of it observing me at speeds extremely close to the speed of light) ?",,,,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,default,Does time dilation ensure that nothing exceeds the speed of light?,,,,http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/o3sy4/does_time_dilation_ensure_that_nothing_exceeds/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1322392945.0,{},,,,,

Let's assume that multiple dimensions (multiple worlds) do indeed exist, and in turn that many more than 4 dimensions exist.  We know we are three dimensional beings (plus time), that can move in three dimensions and through time.  Likewise, we know that if two dimensional beings existed, they would be unable to traverse the third dimension.

In the many worlds frame of thought, we can assume that every possible outcome for any event happens somewhere, along some timeline in another world that splits off the moment an event with different possible outcomes takes place.  If we were able to visit these other worlds we would likely see vastly different outcomes to certain events.

Events such as: Dinosaurs are not wiped out by an asteroid, humans do not descend from a common ape-like ancestor, Earth may not exist at all, etc...  the laws of physics are varied to some degree, such as the speed of light, or the weight of an electron may be different than as we know it now.

Still with me? 

A being that lives in the fifth dimension should be able to 'walk' through the fourth dimension, and a being in the sixth should be able to 'walk' in the fifth.  Neither of the two can 'walk' in a dimension higher than their ability to 'perceive.'

If in fact that every possible outcome eventually occurs, wouldn't it be a fact that at some point, a being has already evolved/formed that has the ability, either by machine or self-power, to traverse all the dimensions *and* each individual multiverse?  

I think it would create a paradox even if the being existed in the dimension directly under highest level dimension, the point of the sum of all possible outcomes of all dimensions.  The reasoning is that this being would be able to change the outcomes of all multiverses at will, thus negating the fact that every outcome will eventually happen, if the outcomes are changed.  If the outcomes are changed, then wouldn't that simply create another universe?  Wouldn't having that ability start to approach infinity?

Or would the being(s) be doing nothing more than fulfilling the final set of all possible outcomes for every possible event?  Even though the numbers are mind numbingly large, assuming that there is a finite amount of matter, then, there *is* a finite set of outcomes, regardless of how large that number might be.

EDIT: Never mind.  The possibility that a being like that could evolve/form, *could* be zero.

I was researching as to whether dimmer switches actually saved electricity, and I stumbled upon this Yahoo! Answers question.

http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061205182328AAq9TuR

The answer provided by 'Jim S' says that a modern dimmer switch (a 'Silicon Controlled Rectifier'), the light is flickering on-and-off really fast to give the appearance of dimness.

So, here comes my question for you guys and gals of AskScience.

If you had a room where the only light source came from lights that were controlled by a modern dimmer switch, is the room technically pitch-black for short periods of time? Or is the light still bouncing around from when the light was on?

My father, who was a pilot and is quite knowledgeable in the ways of physics, asked me this question:

When a light ray travels from air to water (e.g. shining a flashlight in a glass of water), it is traveling at a velocity of 3.0 x 10^8 m/s (c in air). As soon as the light hits the water, the speed of light drops because the water absorbs the light. (c in water &lt; c in air). Let's assume that the same light ray is reflected from the water and back to air. When the light travels back into the air, the speed of light comes back to 3.0 x 10^8 m/s (c in air). That increase in velocity requires a certain amount of energy. Where in the water is the energy coming from in order to speed the light back up to the speed of light in air?

Imagine a 10Kg mass going 20m/s and smashing into a very large stationary object.

  I calculate the Kinetic energy as (.5)(10)(20)^2 = 2000 Joules.

Now imagine (2) 10 Kg masses, each moving 10m/s, on a direct collision course with each other.

  I calculate the Kinetic energy of each as (.5)(10)(10)^2 = 500 Joules.

  Because they are equal in mass, they stop at collision and the Total energy of both masses when they collide will be 1000 Joules.

In both senarios, you have a relative velocity of 20m/s comming to a complete stop yet in the second scenario you only have half the Kinetic Energy.

&gt; I'd been smoking for about 6 years when I met my girlfriend who hates smoking. So I decided to quit. for the past 2 years I have been able to only smoke when the ""mood"" was right which basically ment I've gone from 1-2 packs a day to 1-2 packs every 6 months. I never really get the ""nicotine craving"" Is it possible that some people aren't susceptible to the addictive effects of nicotine?

Personally, I smoked for two-three years straight while in college. I probably did 1/2 to 1 pack a day every day. I would smoked 1-2 pack(s) on nights when I was drinking. However, I did not ""addicted"". I never craved them perse, I did however habitually do it like I do other things (like drink a diet soda with pizza). I decided to quit one day and did so without issue, relapse, etc because I wanted to start running marathons and I figured smoking was probably hindering my ability to progress.

For what it was worth, I was inhaling deeply into my lungs and I would feel the effects of the nicotine if I smoked enough.

In any case, because of this I don't understand 'addiction' (to cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, etc). I have the notion that it exists because I have seen it in the media/from other people.

Thus nothing can escape, so we call it a black hole.

The escape velocity of the Sun is absurdly high, like 617 km/s - yet if I have a rocket, and it plugs along at 20 km/s away from the sun, and it keeps pushing with enough energy to maintain that speed, it'll eventually get out of the solar system.  No where did I have to go &gt; 617 km/s.

I'd think that with enough **energy** you could move something away from a high gravity well.  (obviously this is wrong).  What am I missing?

Image some high energy rocket - that could produce lots and lots of thrust - even if it were not so fast.  And we could send in more fuel, to fuel this rocket, wouldn't it eventually escape the gravity well near a black hole?  I don't understand why it couldn't just keep pushing itself away.

The Pauli exclusion principle claims ""no two fermions can be in exactly the same quantum state."" Most qm books I have encountered describe this equivalently as ""no two fermions can have exactly the same set of quantum numbers"" and then proceed to list a finite set of them that describe the complete state: J, L, S, ml, ms, N, etc (I might be forgetting some). But an electron in the ground state of hydrogen will always have L = 0, S = 1/2, J = 1/2, ml = 0, ms = 1/2, N = 1 by definition. So if a state can be completely characterized by this set of quantum numbers, and an electron in the ground state of hydrogen will only take these values, this seems to imply that there can only be ONE electron in the ground state of hydrogen in the entire universe. Clearly, this is not true, but I'm having a hard time seeing how it is not implied by the Pauli exclusion principle.

It made me wonder – how fast are these bullets traveling when they return to the Earth?  I presume it largely depends on the angle at which the rifle is held when fired.  

But if you were to set up an experiment in which a rifle were positioned at a perfect ninety degree angle and then fired (directly skyward), it seems to make sense that the bullet would return to the Earth traveling at a rate of 9.8 meters / second squared.  For simplicity’s sake, let’s also assume that there is no wind interference of any kind, so the only active force would be gravity (and friction?).

Presumably, once fired, the bullet would exhaust its kinetic energy moving upwards against gravity’s pull, and eventually reach a speed of zero before it started to fall again.  At that point, it would begin to fall at the rate of gravity’s pull.  

If the bullet in our little thought experiment does indeed fall back to the surface at a rate of 9.8 meters / second squared, would it even be lethal? 

There might be some fundamental way I’m misunderstanding gravity here, but damnit I want to ask Reddit and not Wikipedia for once.  


Edit 1:  Thank you for the clarification regarding 9.8m/s squared referring to *acceleration* and not an actual speed.  This certainly clarified things.  

Edit 2:  Assume the rifle is an AK-47 (since this is what the guests seem to be shooting).

&gt;""All Apollo and Gemini flights were followed, both at a distance and sometimes also quite closely, by space vehicles of extraterrestrial origin - flying saucers, or UFOs, if you want to call them by that name.

&gt;""Of course it is possible that UFO's really do contain aliens as many people believe, and the Government is hushing it up.""

And I said to him: ""Let's follow it!"" We followed it for several minutes. It was a bright white light. We followed it to Bakersfield, and all of a sudden to our utter amazement it went straight up into the heavens. When I got off the plane I told Nancy all about it.""

Before we started to run though, my teammate said this: ""I swear when I run 22's it feels like time slows down."" 

At first I didn't think much about what he said, but now I am actually wondering - is this possible? I'm not very familiar with relativity, but I do know that energy plays a part in Einstein's equation. So I guess I'm wondering:

tl:dr Is time slowing down relative to me when I run sprints?

Thanks!

**Background**: I'm doing a bit of online research for a client, trying to get a broad picture of the features [laboratory information management systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_information_management_system) have in common. I'm visiting nearly 200 websites, keeping track of the feature information in a spreadsheet.


The interesting thing about looking at hundreds of websites contained within a similar industry is the opportunity to see trends in how information is presented and products are marketed. For example, there seems to definitely be two camps when it comes to providing feature information: one that freely provides information and another that provides only a few details, defaulting to a ""contact us for more"" statement. But I digress...


Something else I can't help but notice is when a hot females scientist (or model posing as a scientist) is prominently displayed on a company's website. Let me provide some examples that I've ran across so far:


* [2nd Sight Solutions ""OhNo!"" product](http://www.2sslab.com/Production.html)

* [Advanced Technology Corporation's ""VETSTAR"" product](http://www.vetstar.com/hospital_managment/vetstar_hospital_management.htm)

* [Clinical Systems Limited's ""ClinAxys II"" product](http://www.clinaxys.com/contacts.php)

* [Integromics SL's ""OmicsHub"" product](http://www.integromics.com/)

* [LabPlus Technologies, Inc.'s ""LabPlus"" product](http://www.labplustech.com/)

It shouldn't be a surprise that anyone would find female (or male) scientists to be hAwT. Heck, the [hot scientist is a trope](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist) within the world of fiction. (I'm still an unabashed fan of Gillian Anderson's Scully character after all these years.)


But seeing these images lead me to two questions, one somewhat superficial and another more serious:

1. Do calendars with sexy looking scientists exist, and if so, where do I get one?

2. What is the state of women in science in the '10s?


**Calendars**: It turns out that a half-hearted Googling comes up with only a few results for ""female scientists calendar"". (Sorry, ladies. I realize it's just as likely you all may find the idea of the hot male scientist appealing. I'm just focusing on the female scientists for now.)

Also of note is a non-image-based [Google calendar](http://capacioushandbag.blogspot.com/2007/09/might-work-might-not.html) that marks [the birthdays of notable female scientists](http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2006/12/lets_all_have_a_party.php).


There may be many more examples of calendars with female scientists, but I stopped at page four of my search. But damn if I wouldn't pay for such a calendar if it were quality. 

**The state of women in science**: The last example of a calendar that honors birthdays of notable female scientists led directly into my second question. It wasn't all that long ago that I heard about the continuous existence of discrimination against women in science. A Google search of the term (with quotes) [""women in science""](https://www.google.com/webhp?rls=ig#sclient=psy-ab&amp;hl=en&amp;rls=ig&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=hp&amp;q=%22women+in+science%22&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=%22women+in+science%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g4&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=4599l7941l3l8048l20l5l15l0l0l4l1630l2800l0.3.6-1.0.1l16l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=be4ac0f2c7ba068f&amp;biw=968&amp;bih=900) seems to indicate it's still a hot-button issue.


So I'm turning this over to all of you: 

* What's your perception of women in science in 2011? 

* Is the prominence of female scientists plastered on lab-related sites a sign of women being more accepted in science, or is it solely a cheap marketing gimmick, playing to the ""hot scientist"" trope?

These days, buying drug drugs from the Internet is easy, but finding a not dangerous supply for those medicines is not. more and more community are turning to the Internet for less costly drugs that are easy to get, but drug treatments bought from these Web websites repeatedly come with the risk of harming you or your family. Rogue Web websites are all over the Net advertising drug treatments that are not what they show to be. These online businesses may be selling medicines that are fake, contaminated, or otherwise unsafe.

By being knowledgeable about the hazards of retail drug treatments on the Web you may possibly protect yourself and your family from the risks posed by rogue Web websites. NABP has been operational with the state boards of pharmacy since 1999 to combat those web pages that put your health and shelter at risk. Over the years NABP has seen that the risks of retail from a rogue site don't stop at the loss of money. Lives have been lost due to people retail medicines from web pages that send dangerous drug treatments with no medical oversight that may have been tampered with, expired, or even fake.

Knowing which Web online businesses are safe and sound and which ones are not may possibly be confusing. To help you make an knowledgeable choice, and as part of its mission to protect the public's health, NABP has reviewed, and continues to review, 1000's of Web websites to settle on if they maintain safe and sound pharmacy practices. Unfortunately, the majority of Web sites selling medication drug treatments do not.

NABP has created two categories to help you make an well-versed choice:

Recommended World-wide-web Pharmacies: NABP recommends that patients use websites accredited through the VIPPS (Verified Web Pharmacy Practice sites) or Vet-VIPPS (Veterinary-Verified The web Pharmacy Practice web pages) program. These web pages have undergone and successfully completed the thorough NABP official approval process, which includes a thorough review of all policies and procedures as well as an on-site inspection of all conveniences used by the site to receive, review, and dispense medication.
Not Recommended websites: These World-wide-web drug outlets appear to be out of compliance with state and federal laws or NABP patient wellbeing and pharmacy practice standards.
Buyer Beware! That Web Site Might Not Be What It Seems

Many Web websites selling medication medicines are unlicensed, operating illegally, or operating from foreign places where drugs shipped to the United States are unregulated. Thus, there is no way of knowing whether the pills you receive is contaminated, sub-potent, super-potent, expired, or counterfeit, or whether it has been stored and shipped under proper conditions to maintain its effectiveness.

And that Canadian via the internet pharmacy with the less costly prices? It may be calling itself a ""Canadian pharmacy,"" but it may in fact obtain its medications from states in Asia, South America, or Eastern Europe, where quality standards are more lax and phony medications more widespread. While counterfeit medications may surface anywhere, they are appreciably more common in developing foreign countries. That is the problem with retail medicine from foreign sources - you never know what you're getting.

While there are some excellent Canadian World-wide-web pharmacy web pages, NABP cannot recommend any Canadian site selling medicines to Americans because Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations prohibit this activity. prescription drugs imported from other places are not FDA-approved and their shelter and effectiveness cannot be ensured because they are outside the legal structure and regulatory resources provided by Congress.

What Are sites Listed as Not Recommended Doing Wrong?

NABP continually reviews Web sites selling tablets drugs to help you see through rogue online businesses. Of the over 8,000 World-wide-web web pages reviewed, NABP found that 96% of the sites fall in the Not Suggested category because they appear to be working in conflict with pharmacy laws and practice standards. Of the web pages reviewed, those currently listed as Not Recommended are characterized as follows:

80% do not require a valid tablets
46% offer foreign or non-FDA-approved drug treatments
64% use an on the internet questionnaire to evaluate patient fitness and pills needs, which may possibly be very dangerous
26% are located outside of the United States and selling drugs illegally to patients in the US
Only 4% of the websites NABP reviewed are potentially legitimate in that they appear to meet pharmacy laws and practice standards, based on information obtained by looking at the Web site. NABP highly recommends that you use only those Net pharmacies that are VIPPS or Vet-VIPPS accredited. Currently, 43 web pages, representing more than 12,000 online pharmacies, have received official recognition.

He was describing the perception of time as being something that is not happening all at once. We all perceive time differently based on many factors including time is changed by movement in space. So, person ""A""'s movement slows person ""B""'s perception of person ""A"". 

Example: An alien, light years away moving away from earth will perceive its time as ""now"" and time on earth as 200 years later.

So, if time and perception of time is changed by movement in space, could we then travel away from the location of the big bang to document/study it? or would we only be able to say we are perceiving time at the same time of the big bang?",,,,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,self,The Illusion of time.

It is a well known fact that both alcohol and painkillers cause damage to the liver. How exactly does this work? Does the liver have a certain intake threshold, after which further exposure to a particular substance causes the damage? Is there a scale or unit of measurement that provides this type of information for say 1 unit of beer, or 1 aspirin? Does alcohol and pain medication affect/impair the liver in the same manner? And ultimately; what is more damaging, a weekend of heavy drinking or a weekend of painkillers?

I supposed that you know that the energy of electro-magnetic waves is directly proportional to their frequency. The formula E=h*f where E is energy, f is frequency and h is Planck's constant. The radar needs to emit the enormous amounts of energy, because the wave needs to go very far (hundreds of kilometers) than to reflect from the object (in this case an airplane) and after all to came back all the way and still remain strong enough that you can reliably receive it and actually see the incoming plane on the radar screen. That's why the radar uses extremely short wave lengths. The shorter the wave length - the bigger the frequency. The bigger the frequency - the bigger the energy. That simple.

On the other hand the microwave oven also needs the big amounts of energy because it's primar purpose is cooking which requires a lot of energy. For the same reason as radar the microwave uses short wave lengths. These wave - lengths are widely known as MICRO-WAVES. That's how someone came to an idea of using microwave ovens. It would have been certainly much better if we have had developed special decoys, but it was in the middle of the war, and something like that would have taken months of construction.

The existing microwave ovens were just set to work with their doors opened and used as decoys. They were emitting microwaves that were like the ones from air-defense radars.

About your question: can the real radar operate when surrounded by microwaves? Well I'm not sure. I suppose that it can. And why not? It only uses one frequency for sending and the same frequency for receiving. It is probably not disturbed by the frequencies sent by MW ovens that operate at different but close frequency. The radar can be set to work at various frequencies and I suppose that all the MW ovens doesn't use the same frequency as well. There are several devices that transceive at various (but close) frequencies in MW band, but only one of them is receiving his own frequency. That's my guess, but I don't know for sure.

What I know for sure is that we were also using some very old soviet-made radars (from the 1950's) that used extremely long waves (long for MW band, of course - everything is relative, as someone once said :-). These radars were considered hopelessly obsolete, but they came as a surprise for NATO. They just didn't expect that something working on that frequency is actually air-defense radar! So, while they were shooting poor MW ovens the real radar was working, giving coordinates to SAMs. And then... Well you can guess what was happening next. :-)

A typical MW oven has the output power of cca. 1-2kW and a big air defense radar has cca. ~100kW. I'm not sure if we were using several of them placed close to each others to increase power, or something else, but it certainly worked on smaller distances.

The most common tactics we've used is this: All those pilots weren't certainly a bunch of morons who cannot tell the difference between the radar and a decoy pretending to be one. After they suffered the first casualties they learned their lessons. So their typical tactics for attack was: First the big bombers (flying fortress' B-52) flies high above our missile range dropping tens of HARMs (Homing Anti-Radar Missile) that are falling slowly because they are hanging from special parachutes. They need 10-15 minutes to fall on the ground and in the meantime they are seeking for radars - if they spot a source of radar radiation, they automatically unhook their parachutes and activate their booster rockets heading fast toward the radar. That gives the opportunity for other airplanes to attack at lower altitudes for precise bombing without a risk of being spotted by a radar, because no radar can be turned on without being destroyed by HARM in just a few short minutes. But a HARM is just a piece of hardware that CANNOT tell the difference. That's when we turn on our numerous MW ovens. HARMS naturally rush to destroy the ""radars"", and in a few minutes the sky is clear of HARMS. The remaining airplanes can either attack risking to become a prey for our real radars that can be turned on now, or go back home without attacking their targets.

That's the story. Post it on your site if you've liked it. Actually, post the parts of it on your site, because I think it is too big to be posted entirely. Feel free to add my name - I would be happy to see my name there.

Thank you for your concern about my future - it is much better now then it was lust year at this time. We are slowly recovering from consequences of war. Except, of course, for the lost lives, and depleted uranium that will take centuries to disappear. But that's another story.

Best regards from Belgrade, Mladen Mijatovic

P.S: By the way, I have just remembered of one more similarity between MW oven and a radar. I've read a story once about some people on the military airport that have killed a rabbit in the nearby field (200-300m) by using an airplane radar. They simply pointed the radar on the poor rabbit and cooked him instantly! At first, I didn't believe the story, but when I thought about it scientifically (since I'm a student of electrical engineering here in Belgrade :-), I've changed my mind. Just imagine something that is about hundred times more powerful than a MW oven and has focused beam pointed into that rabbit.

Gravitational time dilation was first described by Albert Einstein in 1907 as a consequence of special relativity in accelerated frames of reference. Clocks which are far from massive bodies (or at higher gravitational potentials) run faster, and clocks close to massive bodies (or at lower gravitational potentials) run slower (slow is low). This is because gravitational time dilation is manifested in accelerated frames of reference or, by virtue of the equivalence principle, in the gravitational field of massive objects. Spinning objects such as merry-go-rounds and ferris wheels are subjected to gravitational time dilation as an effect of their angular momentum.

[There are ultra-centrifuges that are capable of accelerations of up to 2 million times the force of gravity (19,600 km/s/s)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultracentrifuge). So if you put a radioactive sample in such a centrifuge, could you detect the time dilation with a simple radiation detector?

&gt;In the 1930's Dirac proposed that the vacuum was a near infinitely dense sea of particles in which all of the possible quantum states were filled. Matter as we know it, is what exists in quantum states above the vacuum. When a particle is knocked out of the vacuum, it leaves a hole called an anti-particle. Strong electromagnetic fields can effect the interactions of electron positron pairs which alter the observed electromagnetic field. The effect is called vacuum polarization and it has been experimentally observed.

It says that the quantum vacuum (aka outer space) is ""a ‘sea’ of short-living virtual particle-antiparticle pairs."" If they are ""short-living,"" that implies that they suddenly spring into existence. However, they must have existed before because when we observe them, they ""spring into existence"" in the same reference frame as the devices used to create them (i.e.- they are not moving relative to the lab). If they truly came from zero matter, then they could not possibly carry with them any momentum. Thus, they would pop into existence completely still relative to the reference frame from which they sprung. To put it simply, the Earth goes around the Sun at 30 km/s - shouldn't these things go slamming into the wall just as a man would if he were to jump in through the door of a speeding train? If they are moving with us when they are created, then whatever they are made out of must have already been moving with us as well.

Bear with me!

I read (somewhere) that infatuation, the ""I want you, you want me, let's have sex"", is caused by a chemical in the brain (dopamine, I think it was), and that the chemical/s (and therefore the infatuation itself) lasts for about 18 months.

This got me to thinking. 18 months sounds like ample time to reproduce, to support the female through pregnancy, and then to make sure that the child is looked after.

So why don't humans move on after having a child, if the evolutionary need to continue the species is fulfilled (the child is healthy and alive) and there is no longer something causing the human to stay around and reproduce (no more chemicals causing infatuation)?

I'd be interested first in whether or not infatuation really is caused by dopamine (or another chemical), if it lasts for ~18 months, and why this entire process occurs.

These questions beg yet more questions: why do humans take life partners, if their 'jobs' are fulfilled the moment they recognise that their offspring is healthy and will continue their genetic line? Is the idea of a relationship, or marriage, therefore a purely social/societal construct? Hell, if infatuation lasts for 18 months, does this mean that sexual infidelity is actually an identifying feature of a person who is, evolutionary, superior?

Answering these questions, and any other information that's at all relevant, would be a very interesting read.

Thanks!

As a black hole evaporates via Hawking radiation it loses mass.  Calculations by Stephen 
Hawking show that the spectrum of the radiation matches that of thermal radiation from a hot 
body (i.e. blackbody radiation). It behaves as though the event horizon has a finite temperature. 
As it evaporates its temperature will increase and the theory suggests that when its event horizon 
shrinks below the dimensions of a nucleus, the temperature reaches trillions of degrees and the 
black hole remnant may explode violently.

I just recently started looking more into it (like literately 5 minutes ago) but i'm having some trouble with some concepts... I understand things very easily but I always want to know why things are the way they are...

I need help linking everything together in the subatomic particle world. Here is what I know.

Basically what I think I know is that there are 3 categories of subatomic particles, Quarks, Leptons, and Bosons... Quarks are: top, bottom, up, down, strange, and charm, and come together to form composite particles called hadrons. Leptons are: Electron neutrinos, Muon neutrinos, tau neutrinos, electrons, muons, and tau (what do these form? do they float on their own around hadrons? like electrons do? or do they also come together to make larger particles?).

Bosons are strange from what I can see, they come in 2 types, elementary, and composite. elementary being things like photons and (gluons? didn't read much on them so don't know exactly what they are) and composite being mesons like protons and neutrons (being most common, and stable)

I also know that there are 4 types of forces, gravitational, weak, strong, and electromagnetic. Strong does not affect leptons, but the other 3 do. Quarks experience all 4 types of force, and they are the only one to do it.

That's what I have so far, but something seems funny with it, in the bosons. I feel that i have that all buggered up. do i have something wrong in that area? [this wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson) is a bit hard to interpret and I don't quite know if Bosons are a category of particles or not... Could someone explain to me in depth bosons?

I also would like to ask, what are these particles made of? Are they the smallest particles that exist? Where did they come from? Could someone link me to an article that I could read about how these tiny particles came about?

It never made sense to me, since light is just reflected off of an actual object, how does how long the light takes to reach an observer have any effect on the object's speed?

Here are two thought experiments that kind of illustrate my thinking. I'm familiar enough with the train thought experiment, and how it relates to time dilation, although I (obviously) have trouble applying it. So, let's look at a photography rolling room (the pitch black room you used to use to roll your film spools in...you know, in ancient times), a darkroom specifically designed to let in no light. Let's say this rolling room is perfectly designed, and in fact perfectly enclosed, so that there is absolutely no light leakage whatsoever.

Now you're sitting in this room, but even though there's no light, time still passes, correct? When you come out of the room five minutes later -- fifteen if you're me, and all thumbs and having constant trouble trying to spool your film -- that time has passed outside the room. So, time is independent of light. So what if this were a very, very large room, millions and millions of kilometers across. And what if you were able to somehow travel faster than c from one end of it to the other? Without any light, would causality be affected at all?

Here's another experiment: Let's say there's a building that's exactly 299,792 meters across, completely enclosed at each end. There are three observers, **Observer A**,**B**, and **C**, who each have perfect vantage points to see both doors, but are on different sides. **Observer A** is positioned closer to the entrance, **observer B** is perfectly inbetween the doors, and **Observer C** is closer to the exit.

**Object X** enters the structure and travels at c to the exit. From **B**'s perspective, **X**'s journey took exactly one second. **A**'s observation, the trip would take an additional second due to his position. However, **Observer C** would see **X** exit the building before it entered.

This however, doesn't violate causality, because there is nothing **C** can do to stop **X** from entering the building. It has already happened, **X** is physically located at the exit of the structure. Just because the light hasn't reached **C** yet, doesn't mean that **X** is still present, it just means that **C** hasn't seen the reflected light from that part of space.

Can someone please explain to me how the observation of a physical event based on the reflection of light, has anything to do with the physical event itself? If the light reflected has nothing to do with the actual physical event, then how would causality be violated if something traveled faster than light?

D = (Vf + Vo)*t/2

D is the unknown distance
Vf is the final speed
Vo is the initial speed
t is the elapsed time


In this case we have that:
Vf = 60 mph = 1/60 miles per second (mps)
Vo = 0 mph = 0 mps
D is unknown
t = 8.8 s

Then
D= (1/60)*8.8/2 = 0.0733 miles = 387.02ft 129.00 yards

a = ( Vf - Vo )/t = (1/60)/8.8 = 0.0018939/s^2

Clearly aging is genetically controlled. Its not that we have to die, we are just programmed to age and die. As far as i am aware there are no evolutionary trait/s that are expressed for no good reason. 

So what is the reason we are still dying? Based on the lecture and the science its seems possible that someone could be born with the right mutations that they end up living forever? like Man of Earth (great movie by the way). Aside from the Good times vs Bad Times (stress) argument presented in the video, what would be the evolutionary reasons for death? The only things i can think of are
1- Without death there would be no evolution, however, that seems a little paradoxal to me, because if no one died we really would not need evolution in the first place. Especially given that to achieve this immortality through mutation it would have taken a long time achieve. 
2- We just have not been around for long enough to naturally get to this point. Given that we clearly have the necessarily biological machinery for immortality, it leads me to think that we are by destiny (so to speak) to arrive to a evolutionary point were we don't die at some point, then why it take so long? Is seems not dying or longevity would be a gene that would be easily passed on. 
3- We need death in order to continue the Circle of Life (as coined by Lion King)

I have a midterm tomorrow for General Chemistry that covers Buffering solutions, ice tables, equilibrium reaction shifts and graphs.

If anybody has some words of wisdom regarding chemistry, or good tricks they use to solve any of these problems, that would be greatly appreciated. 

For anybody interested, these are the homework questions for the subjects that will be covered on the test.
3.	The decomposition of ammonium carbamate, NH2COONH4, takes place according to the equation:
NH2COONH4(s) ⇌ 2 NH3(g) + CO2(g)

Show that if all the NH3(g) and CO2(g) result from the decomposition of ammonium carbamate, then K = (4/27)P3, where P is the total pressure at equilibrium. Hint: you can calculate the partial pressure of a component by multiplying the mole fraction of that component by the total vapor pressure.

4.	When solid NH4HS and 0.200 mol of gaseous NH3 were placed into a 2.0 L vessel at 24 oC, the equilibrium NH4HS(s) ↔ NH3(g) + H2S(g), for which K = 1.6 × 10-4, was reached. What are the equilibrium concentrations of NH3 and H2S?

5.	A mixture of 0.0560 mol O2 and 0.0200 mol N2O is placed in a 1.00 L reaction vessel at 25 oC. When the reaction 2 N2O(g) + 3 O2(g) ↔ 4 NO2(g) is at equilibrium, 0.0200 mol NO2 is present.
(a) What are the equilibrium concentrations?
(b) What is the value of K?

6.	Answer the following questions from Chapter 8: 78, 80. 88, 102, and 112.

7.	tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttCalculate the pH of a buffer system containing 0.40 M CH3COOH and 0.55 M CH3COONa. What is the pH of the buffer after the addition of 0.10 mole of HCl to 1.0 L of the solution? Assume no change in the volume of the solutions.

8.	Phosphate buffers, that is, buffers containing the phosphate group, are present in biological systems such as the blood plasma. Describe how you would prepare a phosphate buffer with a pH of 7.40, assuming ideal behavior.

I believe that I am able to feel an active radio transmitter near my body. There is a physical discomfort I get from having a phone in my pocket for any length of time. Also, I get headaches from talking on a cell phone for too long. However, I am aware that the brain is capable of playing tricks on itself. 

I would like to test my EMF sensitivity in a blind experiment. My plan is to take two android phones, and have a friend randomly put one into airplane mode and set the other to transmit data over 3g. I will then hold the phones in either hand for a length of time until I can feel which one is transmitting. I will then repeat this procedure several times, with my friend randomly switching which phone is transmitting, until I get a statistically significant answer one way or the other. I will not activate the screens on the phones, and my friend will not tell me which phone is set to transmit,  so there will be no way for me to determine which is transmitting, aside from my claimed EMF sensitivity.

I have a few questions before I run the experiment:

1. Is there any app that will make a phone continuously transmit data over 3g? I want to make the contrast between the inactive phone and the active phone as sharp as possible.

2. How many times should I run the experiment to get a statistically significant answer?

3. I do not have two identical phones. My phone is an LG Optimus Slider and my friend's is an HTC Wildfire S. Both are running android. If the transmitting phone is randomly switched enough times, will this be a problem?

4. Is there anything else that I should alter about this experiment or add to make it more thorough and scientific?

I will post the results of the experiment once it is completed, and I give my word not to lie or alter the outcome. If there is enough interest, I may even take a video of the procedure. While it is my belief that I am in fact EMF sensitive, I would not be embarrassed to publicly discover that it is all in my head.

Our readership has more than tripled, as a result of being a default subreddit. Our traffic is up more than 10-fold! The number of moderators has doubled.

And, if I do say so myself, this is *still* the best place in all of Reddit! At least, I learn the most from all you good people, and I hope you do the same. In my opinion, there is nothing more noble than saying ""I don't know, let's find out"", and that's what science and this subreddit are all about. So, more than anything, I just want to say ""thanks"" to all you thousands of wonderful redditors.

Ok, now the announcements!

---

Firstly: **We are inaugurating two new weekly series here in AskScience devoted to broad discussion topics.**

**AskScience Readers Series** -

We specifically welcome our readers' thoughts on scientific topics. Posts like our recent discussion on ""What would you have liked to learn about Astronomy as a kid"" is a perfect example of the type of dialog we are trying to foster.


**AskScience Research Fields Series** -

Our second new series will be devoted to academic questions that are not necessarily 'Science questions'. Topics like: Modern Anthropology; Biotech: academic vs. for profit research; Medicine MD vs. PhD; and questions about the mechanics of graduate school are examples of the types of topics we can discuss.

If you have an idea for a topic, please use modmail to message us (or leave a comment here for us to see). It would be helpful if you title your message ""AskScience (either Readers or Research Fields) Series topic suggestion"". 

Then include your proposed title and additional text you think will get the topic focused and started. Detail the topic and why you think it merits discussion. Remember this should encourage discussion between laymen and scientists. The AskScience moderators will decide which proposal will be invited to be submitted and work to hone the language with the proposer.

---

Secondly: **We do love our logo, but it's really biased towards chemistry! Nothing wrong with chemistry, but the world of science is both rich and broad.**

Artists and designers, please send us new logos that we can use! The logos can be focusing on a specific scientific field, or just generally ""sciencey"", if you can manage that. Either way, we'll take the best ones and rotate the logo every week, so that all the different scientific fields get a spot in the limelight.

Please email your submissions to: r.askscience@gmail.com. If you want, you can include your reddit username, so we can give you a shoutout when your logo is put up.

Submissions should be ready-to-use PNG, and (if you really love us) the vector source, so we can scale it as necessary.

---

Thirdly: **Join in to the /r/AskScience social networks!**

We just added a Twitter account to the mix!

Add us on [***Facebook***](http://www.facebook.com/AskScience) or [***Google+***](https://plus.google.com/117310850002483290031/about) or [***Twitter***](https://twitter.com/#!/RedditAskScienc) to get the best threads each day delivered directly to you!

Why are we doing this? Because not everybody is a redditor - your family, your friends, your colleagues, your followers, your subscribers, and yes, even your secret stalkers, *all* of them should get the chance to get in touch with the real-life scientists who are discovering, testing, and recording new knowledge every day. Who knows? Perhaps they're curious about something? Perhaps they'll learn something just by browsing around (I know I do)? Perhaps they'll start to realize how much our daily lives depend not just on what science has discovered, but on scientific progress.

Only then can we move past this *temporary* period of political idiocy and get back on track towards the future, which will only contain hoverboards, flying cars, light sabers, and invisibility cloaks *if we give science the support and funding that it needs to develop them*. Yes yes, it'll be engineers that develop these things, but only by applying the basic science that the worlds greatest men and women are on the verge of discovering *right now*.

That's my soap-box. Thanks for listening!

Fourth:

In case you missed it, [Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson did an AMA yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/mateq/i_am_neil_degrasse_tyson_ama/). I was 30 minutes late... so disappointed!!! Good reading, though!

---

Fifth:

I'm very disappointed in you, reddit. We take the time and effort to organize an official [Science Fair](http://www.reddit.com/r/asksciencefair), and there's basically zero interest. Why? What did we do wrong? We want this to work for you (even got prizes!), so feedback would be great!

For what it's worth, the deadline is November 28th, so there's still time! ***SO GET ON IT!*** 

---

That's pretty much it, for announcements! 
For those of you who remember the excellent ['6-th graders post'](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hdal5/questions_to_scientists_from_6th_graders_also/), you can check out [this post in /r/assistance](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/mbaxe/ms_christine_needs_your_help/). 

A lot of things are happening. The AskScienceFair is going on, there are a few minor CSS changes we're putting in, subscription growth is stable at ~4000 per day, our moderator team is not going to grow as fast as it has this month (there was some catching up to do!), the number of panelists is now over 1300, and blablabla... let's just have fun with science questions - *maybe we'll learn something from each other :)*

---

As always, we're open to discussion about our moderation policy, the look and feel of the subreddit, and everything else. In fact, [please take this survey to let us know how we're doing](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/RedditAskScience)!  I'm aware our *different* approach to moderation has drawn the attention of a lot of redditors, with our increased exposure and default status. 

Let me be the first to assure you: we're not censoring *anything*, we're just:

* First, getting rid of stuff that doesn't belong, which really just boils down to ""off-topic joke replies made directly to the OP, and the resulting comment tree"". That's 95% of what we do as moderators. 

* Secondly, we remove questions which are not science questions - they might be really interesting to ask a group of scientists, but if it's not a science question, it falls outside the charter of this subreddit, so we have to get rid of it. 

* Finally, we remove really poorly phrased questions, questions that are asking about personal medical situations, and other random mish-mash. For these, we tend to engage the poster in a discussion to help them figure out a better way to approach the problem. Most of the moderators are scientists, and we represent a variety of fields, so we're actually qualified to do this (believe it or not).

It takes light exactly 1 second to travel from one end to the other. It has an engine at the base capable of maintaining a constant acceleration of 1m/s^2.

Theyy decide to take the rocket for a ride. Naturally Kirk rides in the captain’s compartment at the top of the rocket and Scotty rides in the engineering room at the bottom.

Scotty starts the engine and immediately feels an accelerative force equivalent to 1m/s^2.

Kirk does not yet experience any acceleration. Because the base of the rocket can only communicate changes-in-velocity to the top of the rocket at the speed of light, Kirk's acceleration is delayed by 1 second.

@T+00:01

Scotty has been under acceleration for 1s. He determines that he now has a velocity of 1m/s and has travelled 0.5m from his starting point.

Kirk now begins to feel an accelerative force equivalent to 1m/s^2.

@T+00:02 seconds

Scotty: V=2m/s Distance=2m

Kirk: V=1m/s Distance=0.5m

@T+00:03

Scotty: V=3m/s D=4.5m

Kirk: V=2m/s D=2m

@T+00:04

Scotty: V=4m/s D=8m

Kirk: v=3m/s D=4.5m

Etc...

(not sure the distances are quite right)

So I think from T+00:01 onwards both Scotty and Kirk have the same acceleration (1m/s^2) but at all times Scotty is going faster than Kirk. Both Scotty and Kirk observe the rocket getting continuously shorter. As the rocket gets shorter I think the acceleration communication delay affecting Kirk would lessen?

What if the engine was instead at the top of the rocket? Would the rocket get longer? What if there were multiple rocket engines all the way up the length of the rocket giving out equal thrust? Would that avoid any expansion/contraction?

Replace the rocket body with a 3x10^8 meter length of totally rigid wire. Now coil the wire in the shape of a spring (or any other shape) so that the direct distance between the base and top of the rocket is much less than the length of the wire. Would the change-in-velocity notifications still have the same delay in reaching the top of the rocket as the uncoiled wire? If so would this would amplify the length contraction?

I come to you humbly asking for some help. I need to dehydrate gas-phase samples of human breath. I believe that human breath contains about 5% v/v H2O. I need to get that down to around 1ppm. Thus far, I have looked at membranes/purge gas, molecular sieves and silica gels/packed desiccants. Another important consideration is that I would like to not remove other gases, ie. ammonia.

So far, the molecular sieves seem to be the best solution, but looking up the radii of the molecules that are going to be adsorbed is not trivial. I found a paper saying that H2O's radius is ~1.67 angstroms and NH3's is 1.95 angstroms. It appears to me then that the molecular sieves will be unable to discern between the two??

My background is in electrical engineering and I don't have the mental fortitude to take this any further.

And then this conditioning sort of filtered down to everyone later in the form of conformity/social norms (I'm not really sure what the proper term is). Which is why people with atheist parents still feel warm and fuzzy when they do a good deed. 

So this is where I go out on a limb. Doesn't this mean that atheists actually are amoral (not immoral) and that religion is needed in society to perpetuate this whole warm and fuzzy conditioning?

I recently attended a colloquium by Ed Moses, from the [National Ignition Facility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ignition_Facility), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA. 

During my undergrad years in physics, [laser fusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_confinement_fusion) was still ridiculed to some degree, cast as unfeasible (the liquid Lithium curtain was pointed out as particularly laughable) and almost exclusively a ploy to justify weapon's research. Mind you, my physics undergrad profs had stakes in [ITER](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER). I was thus intrigued to see that the NIF seems to think they are only 5-10 years away of the first test fusion plant which will at least break even in its energy budget. 

In his otherwise excellent talk, in which Moses explained the design of the planned fusion plant, he left out two for me quite important details which I hope someone here can answer.

First of all, how is it deemed feasible to drop gold cans containing deuterium/tritium pellets at the rate of 15 Hz through a hole and hit them with an ultrashort, ultra-high energy laser pulse at exactly the right angle at exactly the right time while they are in free fall? (At the moment, they are held in place in a stable position and hit with a single pulse per day, after which the next target has to be reinstalled).

Second, is the gold retrieved somehow on the fly or will it instead end up coating the ignition chamber? At a rate of 15 Hz, you'd go through a lot of gold.

I know of the theory, which does not have much evidence, suggesting constants may vary in the universe.

My question pertains to the universe in its entirety. It has been said before that if a constant changed, the universe would be completely different. It is possible for the universe to have constants that are not truly constant. For example, we know c = 3 x 10^8 m/s, and we know that to a high degree of accuracy. It it possible for this constant to fluctuate by minute quantities (1*10^-20), amounts we cannot measure with our technology.

It just seem with the chaotic nature of the universe that there exists a constant that is absolute and never changing. The sheer quantum nature of universe may cause a constant to fall within a tight a range. I don't know if we would ever me able to measure it, but would there be noticeable effects from these changes?

I am currently working on the question of extraretinal light perception in brain area's, and try to understand why people would want to use it in order to treat affective disorders such as winter depression. Despite an extensive search, I can't stop wondering about how to interpret results of experiments, as mostly the setup of experiments (in humans as well as animals) is very poorly designed and leaves alot of room for interpretation. 
For example, to test extraretinal light perception in a common American alligator, they covered the head of a youngster in cloth and made sure no light would reach the eyes. Then, they made a special 'skull cap' to prevent light entering through the skin and bones. This seems to me like a severe procedure causing alot of stress in the animal, already changing his patterns.. Suddenly blinding an animal will most definitely interfere with the hormones and the animals daily rhythmicity will be altered highly likely..
I could explain another experiment conducted on Eels, but perhaps you can find it yourself if it interests you.. Yet another example of why this science seems very poorly designed and i suppose very 'fundamental'..

My question is asking for your logical reasoning; does extraretinal light therapy work? There are definitely photoreceptors in the brain and in the body, most likely the 'Opsins' would have to be involved but even then it is only a theoretical possibility..

Would it be a better alternative for the present day therapy against Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)'s? I believe that in comparison with normal light therapy, the therapy through the ear (www.valkee.nl) could make life a little easier, however I already have my doubts about the real effect of normal light therapy (vs placebo.)..

You can Save someone's life by sharing this.

STROKE IDENTIFICATION:
During a party, a friend stumbled and took a little fall - she assured everyone that she was fine and just tripped over a brick because of her new shoes. (they offered to call ambulance)

They got her cleaned up and got her a new plate of food - while she appeared a bit shaken up, Ingrid went about enjoying herself the rest of the evening. Ingrid's husband called later telling everyone that his wife had been taken to the hospital - (at 6:00pm , Ingrid passed away.)
She had suffered a stroke at the party . Had they known how to identify the signs of a stroke, perhaps Ingrid would be with us today.

Some don't die. They end up in a helpless, hopeless condition instead. It only takes a minute to read this...

STROKE IDENTIFICATION:

A neurologist says that if he can get to a stroke victim within 3 hours he can totally reverse the effects of a stroke...totally. He said the trick was getting a stroke recognized, diagnosed, and then getting the patient medically cared for within 3 hours, which is tough.

RECOGNIZING A STROKE

Remember the '3' steps, STR . Read and Learn!
Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. Unfortunately, the lack of awareness spells disaster.
The stroke victim may suffer severe brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke.
Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three simple questions :

S * Ask the individual to SMILE ..
T * = TALK. Ask the person to SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE (Coherently) (eg 'It is sunny out today').
R * Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS .

If he or she has trouble with ANY ONE of these tasks, call the ambulance and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher.

NOTE : Another 'sign' of a stroke is
1. Ask the person to 'stick' out their tongue.
2. If the tongue is 'crooked', if it goes to one side or the other that is also an indication of a stroke.

A prominent cardiologist says if everyone who gets this status shares it; you can bet that at least one life will be saved.

    s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (ct)^2

This is why time dilation occurs when something moves.  When something is not moving (relatively), it is still moving along the time dimension at speed c.  To move spacially causes it to move at an angle along the time dimension.  The increased distance due to the angle along the time dimension results in time dilation.

When an electric charge moves, it creates a magnetic field, and vice-versa.  According to relativity, the laws of physics should not change due to the frame of reference, which is why electromagnetism is a unified theory.  Electricity and magnetism are two halves of the same phenomenon.  

If you combine the two ideas it seems like at rest the inherent electric charge of something like an electron is really the magnetic field of an electron moving along the time dimension at speed c.

  Is the magnetic field a more fundamental component than electric charge?  If every electric charge was moving at speed c, wouldn't they all be viewed relatively as magnetic field and electric charge would be non-existent?

According to Wikipedia this particle was travelling so close to the speed of light that:

&gt;[It was most probably a proton with a speed very close to the speed of light, so close, in fact, [(1 − 5×10−24) × c], that in a year-long race between light and the cosmic ray, the ray would fall behind only 46 nanometers (5×10−24 light-years), or 0.15 femtoseconds (1.5×10−16 s).](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-energy_cosmic_ray#Observational_history)

So after 1 year in a race with light, the cosmic ray is only 46 nanometers behind the leading edge of the light beam.  So far so good.  

Now, suppose the light beam in this race is 1 meter long.  As I understand it, photons always travel at lightspeed regardless of how fast you move relative to them.

So if the cosmic ray has taken 1 year in time to cover 1 light year in distance, then the beam of light has had 1 year in which to move away from the cosmic ray at the speed of light.  So at the end of the race, the entire 1 meter beam of light should be 1 light year away from the cosmic ray.

So how is it that we would see the cosmic ray as virtually parallel to the light beam, with only the first 46 nanometers of the beam in front of the cosmic ray?

I assume the answer has something to do with the contraction of space and time, but I just can't grok how the cosmic ray could possibly be both right next to the light beam and simultaneously 1 light year away?

I've searched the internet long and hard for this answer but really couldn't come up with anything. 

So I'm doing a project for my Sound and Acoustics class where we have to build a musical instrument out of everyday items, and I'm trying to figure this out.

We attempted to calculate the resonant frequency of the beer bottle by applying the formula discussed in class for a closed cylinder, which is the speed of sound (1130 ft/s) divided by (4 x length). Or when simplified, the formula is 282.5 divided by length. I then measured the length of the beer bottle (a Corona brand, to be precise), which turned out to be 11.875 inches, or 0.989583 feet. I inputed these numbers into the formula, and 282.5 divided by 0.989583 gave me 285.47. This told me that the beer bottle, without anything inside it, would resonate at a frequency of 285.47 Hz. However, when I played the beer bottle flute and measured it with a tuner, it gave me a reading of 187.1 Hz. This discrepancy initially confused me and my group members, but we decided that the two different diameters of the beer bottle caused this conflict, and we could not find a proper formula to properly calculate the frequency of the beer bottle.

&gt;If you want to know about on your hard disk drive, then it is written with a magnetic field into a magnetic thin film. This thin film is engineered to have very small crystal grains. To write a bit you align all the north poles of a small region of grains either up or down with a magnetic field generated by a coil in your write head flying just above the disk(~10nm or so above the disk). To read the bit there is a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensor inside the read head that consists of two magnetic layers separated by a very thin layer of nonmagnetic conductor. One magnetic layer is very stable and has its north pole pointed in a fixed direction all of the time. The other layer is ""soft"" and will change directions a bit (bad pun) depending on the direction of the magnetic field directly under it originating from the disc. Depending on the relative orientations of the two magnetic layers, the resistance changes from low to high. Low if the magnetic layers point the same direction and high if the are misaligned. This is purely a quantum effect due to the spin of the electrons being polarized as it goes through the magnetic layers. Your computer then reads the bits serially as a series of high and low resistances states which work as 1's and 0's This field is called spintronics which I tried to get added to my flair but I think the mods thought I was making up words.",,,,askscience,t5_2qm4e,,,default,How does memory (electronics) get physically written/read?,,,,http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/lhjo7/how_does_memory_electronics_get_physically/,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,

For example, what happens if you spin a marry-go-round at ~300,000 km/s? Could the metal atoms even withstand such centrifugal forces, or would the bonds between them be literally ripped apart?  Suppose it could withstand the centrifugal forces acting on it, would you still experience time dilation and visual distortion? (I suspect yes to time dilation and no to visual distortions, but that's just a guess).

 

Depending on the above answers, this leads me to my original thought: Imagine an artificial ring constructed in orbit around the Earth (or on the surface theoretically, but space is cooler).  Also imagine we have the technology to attain 99.9999999% of c. Could a ship that travels the length of our artificial ring at ~c be used as a one-way time traveling device? 

Now there are obviously some serious technological problems to overcome with this. To only name a few, there's friction (potentially solved with magnets?), and G-forces would surely crush even the strongest of materials, not to mention propulsion.

Setting aside the inconveniences of relativity that would make star travelers lose all contacts with the relatives they leave behind, we'd want to imagine a situation where traveling to the stars is almost as banal as crossing the atlantic was 3 centuries ago.

To this effect, let's assume we want a crew of a few spationauts to travel in a month of their own time reference to proxima centauri, 4 light years away. Their life-support system is very light: just 450 metric tons, the mass of the ISS. 

For this, they need to travel 4 ly or 3.784×10^16 meters in a month. 

Using E=1/2 m×v^2, the amount of energy needed is: 0.45×10^6 kg  (kilograms) (1.44×10^10 m/s  (meters per second))^2

= 9.331×10^25 joules

= 2.23×10^16 tons of TNT

= (0.24 ~ 1/4) × energy output of the sun in one second

= 1.038×10^9 kilograms (relativistic mass from E=mc^2).

In other words, even if we had a perfect engine capable of transforming matter into momemtum without any loss, we need 2000 times the weight of the payload as fuel to transport our travelers. 
Also, this amount of energy is way more than the [total energy from the Sun that strikes the face of the Earth each year, or 1000 times the estimated energy contained in the world's fossil fuel reserves as of 2003](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(energy)).

And that's for a single one month one-way trip for a few persons! I am also assuming instant- acceleration and deceleration, which is of course unfeasible for the crew... And, I suppose, I neglect very many other issues.

Now to the questions:

1- is the reasoning correct (I have only high-school physics remaining)? In particular, I assume that from the subjective point of view of the travelers, the classical formula for computing the energy needed stays valid.

2 - If I travel 4 light years in 1 month of my subjective time (at constant speed), how close to c would it be for an external observer?

3- are the numbers quite in the ballpark of what's needed?

4- do we have even a vague idea of how to convert such energy into momemtum efficiently?

5- any other idea on how to convey the immensity of the challenge?

For example, a polyprotein is produced when one large RNA transcript is made into one large protein, which is then subsequently cut into multiple smaller functional proteins using proteases, enzymes whose sole function is to cut other proteins.

Later, we learned about signal sequences in prokaryotes (bacteria), and the mechanism which can keep proteins passive and inactive until a particular region is cleaved off by leader peptidase.

Without leader peptidase, proteases would otherwise float all across the cytoplasm of a prokaryotic cell, wreaking havoc all over the place, eating up EVERYTHING. By producing protease precursors and cutting off the leader region to finalize the protease, you can have them float around harmlessly until they reach the destination at which it is appropriate to rip everything to shreds. 

Most proteases are found only within the confines of the lysosome, what I like to refer to as the ""garbage disposal"" organelle. It has a double membrane system to keep its proteases in check- they are clearly dangerous if not placed under multiple layers of control!

So- what would happen if you took two different strains of protease and put them together in a fight to the death? Would one strain emerge victorious? Would there only be one individual protease left after a certain amount of time? What factors would lead to one protease's victory over the other? Would it be possible to do a real-time broadcast of the bloodbath (with play-by-play commentary) using the microscopy techniques we currently have available? If I was to organize a betting ring, what would I stack the odds at in order to retain a house advantage? What specific proteases should I utilize to ensure maximum carnage? How would I dispose of the surviving protease(s) in a way that wouldn't damage my (or any other) cells? Would organizing my metaphorical molecular cockfight get me in any long-term trouble with institutions of research? Would I be forever condemned to the Journal of Insignificant Results?

Based on my reading, the choke of air occurs from 1.0bar to 0.5bar. From what I understand, the air velocity should be approximately 340m/s at this rate, causing a confined region to empty at a rate of 340,000 litres per second through a 1sq meter orifice.

Is this correct?

Second, I've been trying to use the equation for non-choked solutions, but I've come up with a result of 1.0bar to 0.9 bar moving the air at 213m/s. This number doesn't seem right. I would think that the equation would be a curve along corresponding to a sqrt, so the pressure should be less than the linear declination results (68m/s), but obviously, it's far and away above that.

My equations are as follows:

FC = Flow coefficient (using 0.72)

SG = standard gravity (1.0)

Essentially, the tides are constantly in the direction of the moon as the earth spins, applying a frictional force upon the earth's rotation.

1. According to relativity, if a particle were to travel faster than light in one frame of reference, would it then necessarily travel faster than light in *all* frames of reference? If so, why?
2. If a particle were to travel faster than light, does that mean that while it exists, it can *only* ever travel faster than light? (the wikipedia article on tachyons seemed to imply this was the case) Or could something go from traveling faster than light to traveling at subluminal speeds? If it could only ever travel faster than light, why is this, exactly? What equations tell us this is the case?

3. If a particle were to move faster than light, would its speed necessarily be constant across all reference frames, just like that of light is? Meaning, if a certain particle traveled at c + 500 m/s in one reference frame, would it also necessarily travel at c + 500 m/s in every other reference frame?

    node 2 in the on condition represents black

*Unconvinced by his first test the neurologist decides to conduct a second.*

I've been pondering this question for some years and despite some extensive searching and grilling my most engineer minded friends I've still not come up with a satisfactory answer.

In 2007 a narrowboat (well, actually a dutch barge, 70' long, 6'10"" wide, 25 tons) got too close to to [Sawley weir boom](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Barrier_at_Sawley_Weir_looking_up_the_cut_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1105900.jpg) and got itself stuck (not pictured).  The river was flowing faster than usual, jogging speed I'd guess... 3 meters per second.

I wanted to calculate how much force I'd need to pull the boat off of the boom into calmer water and if I could do it with the 2000-pound 12-volt Winch I had.  The owner of the boat thought it'd take something that'd shift 25 ton which of course is nonsense as the weight of the boat is negated by its buoyancy.  What I could not do however was calculate the exact value to negate the force exerted by the moving water pushing on the side of the craft.

Summary of facts and other useful info
 
* Craft dimensions = 70' long, 6'10"" wide
* Craft weight = 25 ton
* Estimated craft draft = 2'
* Estimated water speed = 3m/s
* The hull shape of a narrowboat/dutch barge is almost square and has a flat bottom (with some exceptions but not in this case)

Please can someone solve this very old pondering of mine

Where is science currently looking for clues on the causes for the huge increase in AU?

**Uniform Prevalence**

As I understand it, AU is uniform across socioeconomic, geographical, geopolitical, and ethnic and or genetic classifications.  If that is wrong, please correct me.  If not, this seems to indicate to me that there is something airborne in our atmosphere that is contributing to the rise.

**Landlocked Prevalence**

If persons in landlocked places like Tibet, Mongolia, or Kazakhstan or in places out of reach of the water cycle in rain shadowed areas like in the sub-Saharan lands and or in central Asian regions, then it seems less likely to be something spread in the water cycle, but instead the air.

**Vaccination Bias**

Also, it can't possibly be a vaccine related causation if every population worldwide is experiencing the rate increase.  It seems much more likely to be something that we all experience such as the atmosphere or sunlight.

**Reproduction**

It also has a high propensity to reoccur in parents making a second attempt at reproducing if their firstborn is AU.  Therefore, it would seem likely that the parents are the ones who have had their reproductive systems damaged to one degree or another such that they are unable to reproduce normally.  All of their offspring are highly probabilistic to be AU.

Additionally, because the rise has increased dramatically over the past two decades, the changes in the parents could have started as early as their birth, so at about 1970 onward, the causal factor(s) could have begun to increase and subsequently increased the prevalence of AU through a cascading chain of events.

**Likely Candidates?**

So, if it's not vaccines, it's in the atmosphere or contained within globally accessible, shared resources (air, water, sunlight, atmosphere) of every human being, it's been rising in occurrence in the last two decades, and it causes a change in the reproduction ability in either or both parents wishing to reproduce, then what could be and are the likely candidates of causation?

**Nuclear Fallout**

Of toxic substances, I thought that nuclear radiation in our atmosphere was on the downward trend, since the treaty banning nuclear testing like that of the Cold War era.

**Mercury**

Atmospheric mercurial levels were on the way out with the bans on Hg-based thermometers and devices; however, with the new trend in CFL lighting technology it could potentially swing upward again regardless of the rules and regulations about the safe disposal of the bulbs.

When did fluorescent lighting take off in popularity in the office workplace?  Did and or do those bulbs contain high enough levels of mercury to consider them as a potential source for mercurial dispersion into the atmosphere?  At what point did such fixtures begin to gain popularity in the office place and then subsequently require bulb changing because of the life of the fluorescent tubes?

**Rise in Manufacturing in the Developing World**

I also recognized another coinciding smoking gun.  Manufacturing began to increasingly be outsourced from the developed nations to developing nations about 20 to 30 years ago with China being the major player in that transformation.  Is it possible that a nation with less historic regulation, especially environmental, might have polluted the atmosphere or global environment with some type of toxicity?

In the flavor of faster-than-light travel speculated, it is possible to travel large distances at speed in some kind of ""hyper-space"", but when doing so no velocity is gained (or lost) in ""normal space"".

Inspired by this I'm trying to determine just how big the difference in relative velocity between two stars is. I'm untrained in these things, but [Wikipedia says of our sun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun):

&gt; Velocity: ~20 km/s (relative to average velocity of other stars in stellar neighborhood)

However, my gut says it's more complicated than this, because stars orbiting closer or farther from the galactic center of mass will be traveling in different-sized orbits, and so a vector which follows the orbit of one star might not follow another, in addition to being too fast or too slow.

So my question is, if some object were transported from one star to another (with identical mass, but closer in to the galactic center of mass), just how big would be the required change in velocity to orbit the destination star? I'm just not keying into what kind of math is required here.

I'm no geologist, but I did take a geology course which covered earthquakes and fault lines to a limited extent. I understand there are p-waves and s-waves, and that p-waves are faster-moving than s-waves and are usually a sort of warning sign that an earthquake is about to hit. According to the seismograph records for the earthquake in question, there were no preceding p-waves recorded.



Why is this?

I understand that the earthquake itself is rare in that it occurred in a location where there are no major active fault lines in the middle of a tectonic plate. Is the lack of p-waves a regular feature of these kind of uncommon quakes?

I'm really perplexed about this. Any input is greatly appreciated.

This doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, as people in the past were outside all day long.  Why weren't people getting skin cancer?  A lot of people assume that people just died too early in the past, but the average life span was low due to childhood diseases, once they reached adulthood, they did not live much shorter lives than we do today.  

It seems that people get a tan to protect them from the sun.  In the past, people were out in the early spring, when the sun's angle was low (this is for northern hemisphere caucasians).  Their light skin would soak up more sun during the shorter days and low angle of the sun, and then tan up as the days got longer and the sun's angle increased.  By mid july, they had a nice tan and were ready for hot days with the sun directly overhead.  If all sun exposure caused skin cancer, how do people in S. America and Africa not get cancer?  The response is that people are actually getting cancer there... could this be due to those areas getting TV and such, and now staying inside more often?

Today people stay inside too long, then go out in July with light skin and get a burn, which damages the skin.  So instead of being outside more, people just wear sunscreen, and now TV shows talk about how people in the US have huge vitamin D deficiencies.

So that can be translated towards magnetism, right? Well that's where I get confused. As of now, there's no such evidence as a magnetic monopole, so I feel odd carrying that analogy.

Then I saw a picture of a [magnetic field around a single bar magnet](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/VFPt_cylindrical_magnet_thumb.svg) and noticed the arrows pointing towards a direction, the direction of the magnetic field at that location.

Then I saw [two bar magnets repelling each other](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/VFPt_cylindrical_magnets_repelling.svg) where the differently aligned fields seem to push off each other.

So if the South pole of magnet 1 is called S^1 , and the North pole of magnet 2 is called N^2 , is S^1 really attracted to N^2 ? What I see is, it's not really the poles that are attracted to each other, it's the individual magnetic field lines emanating from each magnet wanting to ""line up"" with one another. So the magnetic moment of one magnet wants to line up with the magnetic field of the other magnet.

I'm currently helping my lil bro design a MHD for an amphibious RC car he has to make for his Ba Eng course, we figured an MHD would be much more interesting than the standard paddle wheel setup.


What we've come up with so far is a square plastic tube about 10cm long (~4 inches) with height and width dimensions of 2cm (~1inch), with a quarter size neodymium magnet on the top and bottom of the tube in the middle (On the outside of the tube) with two square aluminium/copper plates (H+W of 2cm) on the sides of the tube in the middle (Where the neodymium magnets are except on the inside of the tube) so that the current between the two plates passes perpendicular to the flux lines between the two magnets thus creating a positive thrust.


We plan to power it by a bank of 8-10 9v batteries in series to get as much of a potential voltage difference between the two plates as possible.


We haven't had a chance to do any testing yet (Still getting bits together)


Basically I'm after anyone who has experience with MHDs and knows of an efficient way of creating one or has any ideas on how to improve the above design while remaining on the cheap.


Cheers guys! =D



*EDIT* Question, we're a little worried about the dangers of the battery pack and the potential of electrocution, 10 9v batteries in series will push out 90volts and assuming wet hands (Working with an ionic fluid after all) I think skin resistance drops to ~ 1000ohms which will mean an amperage of ~90mA. Now I know that around 50mA directly across the heart can cause cardiac arrest but will ~90mA from the battery pack between two hands cause issues? I've tried researching on google for some answers but the only real figure I'm getting is the 50mA directly across the heart and not much else. :S

I have a question about ""genetics.""

We've *all* heard someone say things like ""So and so is lucky, s/he can eat anything and not gain weight, whereas so and so number 2 thinks about cake and gains 5 pounds,"" or something to that effect.  Basically, hardgainers vs. ""big kids.""  Often you'll see this in siblings, who are raised the same way, eat the same way, and have similar activity levels (roughly, anyway).

Now I realize that this phenomenon is observed by many but that there is no hard data  - things like diet and activity level obviously aren't studied scientifically and exactly.  Still, we see this happen with people with *roughly* the same lifestyle.

So how much of this is actually genetics?  Do some people *really* just ""gain weight easier"" than others, or lose it easier?  It seems that many people use genetics as an excuse, but that there might be a little something to it.

That was long winded.

I'm working on a Flash game (2D) that involves magnetism and could use some help/suggestions on how to set it up. Essentially, take Asteroids, but instead of dodging big rocks moving around, you have a ship that has magnetic polarity and is affected by the magnetic fields of planets. You can press spacebar to flip the ship's polarity, similar to [Ikaruga](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj23K8Ri68E)'s color changing. Planets can be black or red, and if your ship is positively aligned (black), it's repelled by black planets and attracted by red planets, and vice-versa if your ship is negatively aligned (red). The planets are fixed, so they don't move, and come in different sizes. It's a silly concept and not entirely realistic, but I would like to make the magnetic physics as accurate as I can.


So, I've been reading up on how magnets work, and I understand the basics in terms of atomic charges, polarity, potential magnetic energy, stuff like that. But I'm looking through the formulas associated with these and am having some trouble making the connections. Essentially, I believe, I need the formulas for attraction/repulsion. According to [this site](http://www.physicstutorials.org/home/magnetism), the formula is **F = k((m1 * m2)/d)**, where **k** is a constant, **m1** and **m2** are the magnetic intensities of the different magnets, and **d** is the distance between them.


Here are my questions on this:

* What is the constant? How is that found?

* How do I find the magnetic intensity? Is it determined by the magnet's mass? Is mass even a factor?

* How would I use this force value to ""pull"" or ""push"" the ship (update its x and y values - I assume I would use the vector formula in some way)? How would the formula differ if the ship is trying to move in a different direction under its own power when the planet's attraction/repulsion comes into play?

* Am I completely misunderstanding how magnets actually work? Should I dump magnetic properties and just use mass/gravity physics and pretend it's magnetism?

Next to our electron microscope there is a periodic table that is color coded with a few various colors. The colors represent various shells (K-shell, L-shell, M-shell) that we set the microscope to in order to analyze our samples. For example, if we know a sample has roughly Fe-Nb in it, but we want to know the percentages of each element, we'd set the machine to measure Fe's K-alpha shell and Nb's L-alpha shell. We do we use specific shells in order to quantify each element? Don't both atoms emit energies from both of those shells/transitions?

What makes a specific atom's electrons jump across these specific transitions? Can someone give a detailed explanation of EDS and how it works on this level? As you go down the periodic table there are many shells, yet EDS charts only show transitions between three shells (K, L and occasionally M for the heavier Rare Earths). What about the N, O, P and Q shells?

Also, why do I never hear about the g-subshell in the 5th energy level? With every energy level, there is the same number of subshells at the lower numbers (1^st energy level has 1 subshell (s), 2^nd energy has (s, p), 3^rd energy has (s, p, d) and 4^th has (s, p, d, f)). What happens to the 5^th, 6^th and 7^th energy level? Why is it that these energy levels still only contain s, p, d and f?

Light moves faster than 70km/s, so is it possible for light to reach the 'edge'? If so, does it just disappear? I would think that it cannot, since you cannot create or destroy matter, but if it somehow rebounded then the whole universe would be filled with light, correct? And that doesn't make sense. So why can light not reach the 'edge'? (Sorry for contradicting myself but I don't understand.)

How can it be that objects are still expanding outside of our observable universe? It makes sense that objects moving faster than the speed of light after the big bang would not be seen, but I'm confused on how objects can still be moving outside of our observable universe. If we could see that light earlier, how can we not see that light today?

If you were on an object at the very edge of the entire universe, would you only be able to see your observable universe's light from one side of the object, and the other side would be completely black?

At the end of time, big freeze, whatever you wish to call it, will anything still be near where the big bang occurred? Will any atoms exist there? Or will literally everything have expanded far away from the 'center'?

I'm not a scientist, just a guy who like solving puzzles and the universe is one helluva puzzle.

If the universe is expanding at about 75km/sec (correction: per megaparsec), and light travels at about 299,792 km/s it seems apparent that light from inside the universe, reaches the ""edge"" of the universe, assuming it even has an edge. What happens to this light once it doesn't have space-time to travel through? That energy can't just vanish can it? Is it possible that light is driving the expansion of the universe as it reaches the edge and drags space-time along with it?

If the universe is expanding by light stretching the edges of spacetime, I imagine that the expansion would be faster near the edge, and slower in the center as spacetime catches up with itself. As we, and everything else are being pulled away from the center, moving towards the outer edge, could this account for the apparent acceleration in the expansion of the universe?

I realize that none of this is really testable, at least not by me, I'm just wondering if there is some other variable that I have not accounted for that nullifies the whole thing. Basically, does it hold up, could I be on the right track, or am I just plain wrong?

I guess if the universe ""bends back on itself"", this question is irrelevant and that's what I got out of Google, but as far as I know, the actual shape of the universe has not been determined.

* 4 (balanced, of course) groups.

* No group is allowed to have sun screen

* Take a baseline measure of everyone *prior* to sun exposure (I don't know what this would be, but a simple controlled-lighting image would work)

* Between the hours of 2:00pm and 3:00pm on a clear day in an open setting (i.e., no shade around; I suppose a tanning bed is an acceptable, and more controllable replacement?)

* Group 1: Go outside in the sun for 30 minutes; go back inside for 30 minutes.

* Group 2: Stay inside for 30 minutes; go outside for 30 minutes.

* Group 3: Alternate going outside, then inside, every 10 minutes for 60 minutes.

* Group 4: Alternate staying inside, then going outside, every 10 minutes for 60 minutes.


Now, you can see some redundancy in the groups, but this is to control exposure with respect to time of day (I'd probably have 2 more groups, no sun exposure and 60 minutes sun exposure). 

Will all of my 4 groups have the same amount of skin color change/damage due to sun exposure (i.e., sun exposure is linear and accumulative) or will my 30 direct minute groups have more exposure than my alternating groups (implying sun damage is not linear; hopefully not a big exponential, but that there is a ""dip"" in the damage function with shade).

The change would be compared to baseline *per individual* first, then get group means. I assume ""change"" values could be calculated (if you take pictures) by doing a simple image contrast change in the controlled-lighting settings.  A simple S(A x B) ANOVA should suffice. Or for fancy-pantsness: a PCA-based discriminant analysis on the subtracted images.

Basically, for people who enjoy sunbathing (I don't, I'm translucent), is it *safer* for them to do it in one shot or to alternate their exposure and shade?

However, lately I've wondered how daily values are established for vitamins, minerals, sodium, cholesterol, protein, potassium, etc... Are these values based on studies conducted in a scientific manner? I admit, I've only briefly looked into it but haven't really found anything that cites actual studies that help to establish these values. Everything I read simply states that these are the values determined by the Food and Drug Administration. I know they can't just be arbitrary numbers, so I'm curious as to how they're established.

Edit: I found on this on Wikipedia, though it only raises more questions. [The RDA was developed during World War II by Lydia J. Roberts, Hazel Stiebeling and Helen S. Mitchell, all part of a committee established by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences to investigate issues of nutrition that might ""affect national defense"" (Nestle, 35). The committee was renamed the Food and Nutrition Board in 1941, after which they began to deliberate on a set of recommendations of a standard daily allowance for each type of nutrient. The standards would be used for nutrition recommendations for the armed forces, for civilians, and for overseas population who might need food relief. Roberts, Stiebeling, and Mitchell surveyed all available data, created a tentative set of allowances for ""energy and eight nutrients"", and submitted them to experts for review (Nestle, 35). The final set of guidelines, called RDAs for Recommended Dietary Allowances, were accepted in 1941. The allowances were meant to provide superior nutrition for civilians and military personnel, so they included a ""margin of safety."" Because of food rationing during the war, the food guides created by government agencies to direct citizens' nutritional intake also took food availability into account.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_Daily_Intake)

[The Food and Nutrition Board subsequently revised the RDAs every five to ten years. In the early 1950s, USDA nutritionists made a new set of guidelines that also included the number of servings of each food group to make it easier for people to receive their RDAs of each nutrient. Even still, the RDAs are controversial in nutrition circles because the daily maximum for some nutrients, like sodium are higher in the U.S. than in other parts of the developed world, and are far above established safe minimums.[4][5] For instance, the National Research Council has found that 500 mg of sodium per day (1/4 of a teaspoon) is a safe level.[6] In Great Britain, the daily allowance for salt is 6g (approximately 1 tsp, about the upper limit in the U.S.), but are still considered ""too high.""[7][8]
In 1997, at the suggestion of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy, RDA became one part of a broader set of dietary guidelines called the Dietary Reference Intake used by both the United States and Canada.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_Daily_Intake). 

I've browsed the references at the bottom of the page and while being somewhat informative, none of them detail how anyone actually determines these values. Every resource simply tells what the latest and greatest agreed upon values are, and maybe provides a paragraph or two about the benefits of each nutrient.

Journal of Evolutionary Psychology (2011):

&gt; The autism continuum could represent a remnant of genetic introgression that took place before humans were the lone species in our genus. Perhaps some of the genes for autism evolved not in our direct ancestral line but in a solitary subspecies which later merged genetically with our line of descent through gene flow.

The fact that the male side of the admixture(s) was/were strictly neanderthal would mean that we share none of their mtDNA. This explains the lack of mtDNA abnormality and the existence of mitochondrial dysfunction in people with ASDs:

&gt; the frequent observation of concomitant mitochondrial dysfunction and ASD could be due to nuclear factors influencing mitochondrion functions or to a more complex interplay between the nucleus and the mitochondrion/mtDNA.

**The part that I need an expert's help to interpret is this disease network that I added to Autworks: ** http://tools.autworks.hms.harvard.edu/networks?gene_set=123

I got the 432 initial genes by copying the ""Candidates for positive selection"" from page 111 of the supplemental pdf for the neanderthal draft sequence: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2010/05/05/328.5979.710.DC1/Green_SOM.pdf

It looks like there is strong linkage when it's checked against the 699 genes implicated in autism: http://i.imgur.com/N5ObG.png

*Note: The cluster in the bottom left is of genes that code for olfactory receptors. Neanderthals seem to have had smell-related genes that were important enough for us to keep.*

The opposite (blue = autism, orange = neanderthal) is also interesting: http://i.imgur.com/kBXYM.png

It shows 264 genes with 624 interactions (using the lenient settings in the screenshot)

* PITX3 ""is involved in lens formation during eye development.""
* SRD5A2 ""catalyzes the conversion of the male sex hormone testosterone into the more potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone.""
* CADPS2 is already implicated in autism.
* GABRA2 ""is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain""
* BDNF ""acts on certain neurons of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, helping to support the survival of existing neurons, and encourage the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses.""
* ROBO1 ""was implicated in communication disorder based on a Finnish pedigree with severe dyslexia. Analyses revealed a translocation had occurred disrupting ROBO1. Study of the phonological memory component of the language acquisition system suggests that ROBO1 polymorphisms are associated with functioning in this system.""
* MY01D codes for the tails of spermatozoa.
* STK3 ""presumably allows cells to resist unfavorable environmental conditions.""
* SND1 ""plays an important role in miRNA function""
* OTX1 ""may play a role in brain and sensory organ development"" is a ""dyslexia susceptibility locus candidate gene"" and ""is important in neuronal cell development and differentiation""

I thought the abundance of linkages might be the result of lenient settings, so I fiddled with them: http://i.imgur.com/GhbQ7.png

* EHBP1 Has a role in insulin regulation: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15247266
* The HOXD family seems to have something to do with limb development.
* FOXP1 ""expression patterns in human fetal brain are strikingly similar to those in the songbird, including localization to subcortical structures that function in sensorimotor integration and the control of skilled, coordinated movement""
* AUTS2 is directly implicated in autism.

**I'm wondering if the abundance of links between autism and neanderthal genes on the disease network is because there is a direct relationship or because any collection of 432 genes will probably have some degree of connection.**

432 genes with positively selected neanderthal variants: http://tools.autworks.hms.harvard.edu/gene_sets/123

Many of them are implicated in autism, aspergers, adhd, ataxia (neuromuscular ""awkwardness"" associated with autism and autistic traits), etc.

_________

This is an in-depth analysis of the methods used in the neanderthal draft sequence: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/20

Questions answered include:

* Isn't it extremely difficult to get authentic undamaged DNA from individuals dead for over 30,000 years?
* We must have a lot of DNA in common with archaic hominins because of our shared ancestry - How can we infer interbreeding?
* This seems quite a subtle test - Might these results be explained by human contamination?
* What about DNA damage?
* How confident can we be of any interpretation if the sequencing error rate and the divergence are that close?
* Assuming that we can be confident of the conclusions of these studies, how much of our genomes comes from other hominins?

Personally, I'm of the camp that adores smokeless powder, and the energy density thereof. So, I started running some numbers, but I'm finding I'm making quite a few assumptions along the way. I'd like some input.

My starting point minimum would be a way to duplicate the ballistics of a single-shot .30-30 rifle. The .30-30 being a an entry level caliber that could serve for defense and also hunting of medium game.

A 170gr .30-30 travels at about 2200 ft/s. Doing the math, that's about 2500 Joules of energy we need to impart on the projectile. 

This may be a bad assumption here regarding the amount of water needed to act as a propellant: Case capacity of a .30-30 is 2.45 cc. Realistically, some case volume is lost due to bullet seating, but I went with it as a starting point. More case volume (water) will certainly cause the energy input to increase. 

Assuming water at room temp, 20C. We’ve got to heat a quantity of water from 20C to 100C, then to vaporize it, we’ve got to do a phase change to convert the liquid into gas.

+ It takes 4.184 joules to heat 1 gram of water 1 degree.  

So (2.45 grams of water)*(4.184)*80 degrees ---&gt; **821  J to heat the water**

+ Heat of vaporization is 2,257 kJ/kg, or 2,257 Joule/gram. With 2.45 cc or water or 2.45 grams of water, to change phase from liquid to gas. 

(2.45 g)*2,257 J/g* = **5531 J to convert 100C water to 100C gas**

**To simply to boil the water in the case, 821 J+5531 J will cost us 6352 J**


This is where it begins to get confusing. Would the water require more energy to heat the gas beyond boiling? Or would the simple act of converting it to steam very quickly to accelerate the projectile?


Actually, the more I think about it, the rate of reaction, and the power input thereof, will dominate.


So, assuming a 24"" barrel, and the projectile needing to hit 2200 ft/s, the projectile will need to accelerate from 0 to 2200 in 1/1100 seconds, assuming average acceleration. (not exactly true for smokeless powder, but an estimate)

**So using transitioning from energy to power, we would need to dump 6352 J into the water in 1/1100 s. So (6352)/(1/1100) =&gt; 6,987,200 W, or about 7 MW**. 

That seems like an awful powerful discharge. Probably possible from a large bank of lead-acid batteries, but probably not something easily man-portable.

I'm also familiar with [radiative cooling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling), the process by which the earth's heat energy dissipates into space faster the warmer earth is. However, it seems to me that this negative feedback effect acts as a brake on both warming *and* cooling, so it can't actually reverse global warming, only slow it.

According to the manufacturer of my fire dept.'s cardiac monitor (LifePak 12), the limb electrodes must be placed on the limbs, rather than on the torso. I've heard this a few times, and I was wondering why they have to go on the limbs. (The manual says that as long as they're on the limbs, specific location doesn't matter.)

 Our department almost universally uses wrists and ankles, but a larger department nearby seems to more often place their 3-lead electrodes on the torso, and move them to the limbs for 12-leads.

Does anyone know what the reasoning is behind this?

Alright, so I'm not really surprised by the results of this study. But, I don't think my reasoning is valid. (Nor properly justified)

So, 1/7 kids apparently have a disability. (According to this study) That's about 15%. I assume that mental disabilities are measured on a bell curve type of scale. (There are a lot of kids who ""can"" do something, some who can't and some who can go well beyond. I'm assuming it's a bell curve because of human behavior often is, AFAIK.)

If you count all of the kids who are ""less than one standard deviation"" of the ""average"" kid, that's (1-.68)/2 ~= 15%. 

So, it would be expected that ~15% of kids would ""fall below"" the average by a value this extreme. Just as goes with IQ scores, how yes, a lot of people will do poorly on them.

Now, here's my problem. I don't know if any of that is actually how it is. It just fits together nicely. So, is there any backing to this?

I initially put it down to the eye's refresh rate, so I started to roughly calculate it from what I could see:

* Assuming I could see 5m out the window  
* Traveling at roughly 70MPH, so around 30meters/second  
* Somewhere in the region of 30 dots over that distance  
* 5m @ 30m/s would be around 0.17s  
* This would put the refresh rate at every 0.0057s  
* Puts the refresh rate at very roughly 175Hz

Put when I said this out to everyone else, they pointed out that solid light normally blurs rather than strobes. If you can see something strobing, you're seeing its refresh rate, not your eyes.

Most people it seems fall into the low-moderate to high-moderate range of a few drinks per week.  As someone in my 20's, I'm probably a bit toward the upper end, although far below the true alcoholics that hospitals see who claim to drink bottles of vodka every day.

I'm mostly curious as to what are the general problems associated with moderately high, but not extremely high, alcohol consumption.  I drank  a fair bit in college, and on weekends I still binge here and there, although not excessively.  I still function as an individual, and I test myself from time, by abstaining for a few weeks, to see if I feel the ""urge"" that might indicate some form of dependence.  I haven't, and I feel I'm psychologically sound in that respect--I do it for fun, not because I need to, and not because I'm dependent.

I suspect that most of the problems will be heart-related.  I exercise a lot, have virtually no family history of heart disease, and I don't expect any heart failures (although obviously they are possible).  What are other potential effects?  The liver regenerates--how much do you really need to drink to damage your liver over time?  Are there other problems?

For a basis of measurement, I'd say I usually have about 5-6 drinks on Friday and Saturday nights.

In practice, this means that all geostationary satellites have to exist on this ring.

If you are interested in both stats and Scrabble, maybe you can help me try to figure this out. 

In Scrabble, the common practice is to determine who goes first by drawing one letter from the bag. The player who gets closest to A goes first. For the purposes of this, let's assume there is an advantage to going first (I think this is accepted as true; the first turn is automatically doubled, and the first player has a greater possibility of going more turns and being the first player to run out of tiles, both of which are advantageous for scoring purposes). 

So the point of drawing a letter to determine who goes first is that it is supposed to be random. However, the letter tile distribution is not even across the alphabet: 


(A-9, B-2, C-2, D-4, E-12, F-2, G-3, H-2, I-9, J-1, K-1, L-4, M-2, N-6, O-8, P-2, Q-1, R-6, S-4, T-6, U-4, V-2, W-2, X-1, Y-2, Z-1 and Blanks-2.)

Since this isn't an even distribution, might there be a (slight) advantage to being the first person to draw from the bag (once a player draws a letter, they do not replace their letter until the other player(s) has drawn his or hers)?

I'm particularly interested in how to set up the equation to determine if there is a statistical advantage to drawing the first letter or allowing your opponent to draw the first (again, assuming you want to have the first turn). 

Thanks to any and all who this is of interest!

Here's the exact quote:

&gt; JUST BEFORE VOYAGER 2 was to encounter the Uranus system, the mission design had specified a final maneuver, a brief firing of the on-board propulsion system to position the spacecraft correctly so it could thread its way on a preset path among the hurtling moons. But the course correction proved unnecessary. The spacecraft was already within 200 kilometers of its designed trajectory-after a journey along an arcing path 5 billion kilometers long. This is roughly the equivalent of throwing a pin through the eye of a needle 50 kilometers away, or firing your rifle in Washington and hitting the bull's-eye in Dallas.

He compares the spacecrafts' trajectory to threading a needle from 50 km, which basically seems impossible.  The distance from Earth to Uranus is small compared to the distance of the nearest star.  So I'm asking, is it even possible for us to successfully send a probe to another star?  If sending a probe by Uranus is like threading a needle from 50 km, then sending one to another star should be like throwing a pin through the eye of a needle on the moon, right?  If it's possible to send a probe to another star, then how much more difficult would it be to send one to an exoplanet in another stars system?
