I got a BSME and worked in big 3 aerospace/defense for 3.5 years as a Manufacturing Engineer while concurrently getting an MS in Systems Engineering. after I finished the MS, I really wanted out of manufacturing and took a full remote 1 year contract-to-hire with the title Systems Engineer at a different big 3 aerospace company, and am currently about halfway through that contract. (I am in a good place for contracting in that I‚Äôm a W2 employee, on my spouse‚Äôs healthcare, and after subtracting 401k contributions and 5 weeks vacation I still got a salary bump). 


My goal is eventually to work as a Systems Engineer (probably MBSE), stay full remote, and get out of aerospace/defense‚ÄîI want to work somewhere where I don‚Äôt have to record my hours, so probably tech I guess. 


The hitch is that my current Systems Engineer role is part of the IT org, which I didn‚Äôt quite understand when I accepted the job (my fault I know). Now I‚Äôm not user-facing so far. But I‚Äôm working on an R&amp;D effort to create digital connections between different sets of software and tailoring that framework to a couple different applications, and also doing a little MBSE work here and there. I‚Äôm really not familiar with what is considered ‚ÄúIT‚Äù, so I‚Äôm wondering if this is IT work or engineer work? 


I‚Äôm at the stage where I‚Äôm trying to decide if I would accept a full-time offer after the contract is over, or start looking elsewhere. It will probably depend on if I feel I have learned enough about software systems to apply to new roles, and if I feel that I‚Äôm learning and doing actual SE work.

It‚Äôs for a design technician role.

Now that I have the offer in front of me I‚Äôm hesitant as to whether or not I should take it. My concerns and thoughts about them are laid out below. I‚Äôd be curious to hear what other people in the field‚Äôs thoughts are too.

     -I don‚Äôt really know much about the job. The job description was extremely vague and when I asked questions about my responsibilities in the interview they couldn‚Äôt really give me a straight answer. They basically told me I could be doing any number of things although about 80% of my work would be in CAD. But they really didn‚Äôt elaborate on what aid be doing in CAD either. 

I have a call with the company this afternoon and plan on asking more specifically what my job duties would entail and hopefully that would clear this up but it sounds like they‚Äôre still gonna be vague about it.

    -It‚Äôs not an engineering job. The job description basically just requires some level of design experience and some personality based qualifications. I understand that if I‚Äôm having trouble finding a job in engineering then I should just take what I can get and use it as a stepping stone but I already have about 8 months of experience in design in addition to extra curricular and personal projects so I‚Äôm not sure how this could add value to my resume for the future. I also have a friend from eng who took a similar role and says he hates it so I don‚Äôt want that to be me either.

I‚Äôve been looking for a job for a while and this is the first offer that has come across my plate. But I have a BASc in Mechanical Engineering and it‚Äôs pretty obvious that they‚Äôd like to hire me bc I‚Äôm overqualified for the role. I like design but I‚Äôd like to do a lot more than that and I‚Äôm qualified to do more than that.

    -The job is located in the middle of nowhere french Canada and is entirely french (got duped by an english job posting). I went to french elementary, middle and high-school so my french is good but I don‚Äôt really want to be speaking french all the time both at work and out and about. Not to mention I don‚Äôt know anyone where the job is located so there‚Äôs also that. Then there‚Äôs also having to come up with living arrangements too (ie do I sign a lease that essentially locks me into that job for a year?)

Given that the position is about 80% CAD I‚Äôm considering asking about a hybrid or remote working arrangement.

    -Salary. In typical corporate fashion they made no mention of what I should expect as far as salary goes until the offer. Salary is about what you‚Äôd expect for a technician but low for an engineer.

I can try to negotiate a higher salary but this isn‚Äôt even my biggest concern. 

Irregardless of all these factors I would just be using the job as a stepping stone as I don‚Äôt want to be a technician so it would just be temporary. But is this even a good first step toward getting to that point? Given that I already have experience in the space and all?

And on that note how long would be a reasonable amount of time to stay in a position to gain experience before I start looking for something else? months? a year? 2?

Curious what everyone else‚Äôs thoughts are whether you‚Äôre a professional in the field or someone who has been through a similar situation.

I plan on raising the appropriate concerns in negotiations but for obvious reasons I don‚Äôt want to raise them all to them so that‚Äôs where I was hoping for some input.

Got 4 emails from an agency this weekend. Different ‚Äòrecruiters‚Äô all with the same agency listed. Tagging me for what would be a step down in seniority and title, and probably salary. Of course they can‚Äôt  share the name of the firm. 
 
Do any of these sound familiar: 
 
‚ÄúI saw your profile on LinkedIn‚Äù no you didn‚Äôt, someone gave you my name from a search. 
 
‚ÄúThis is about the post as JOB TITLE‚Äù that‚Äôs the title I have or had 5 years ago. 
 
‚ÄúEven if you‚Äôre not interested in this post it doesn‚Äôt hurt to explore what‚Äôs out there‚Äù yea, it does. 
 
I was naive maybe 10 years ago. I let a recruiter have my info and permission to see what‚Äôs out there. Nothing came of it that I would actually take. 
 
And then I learned that most of these recruiters just scan company websites, indeed or similar for job postings, then get your resume if you have somewhat similar experience, then contact HR ‚Äòon your behalf‚Äô. I know this because when I tried to hire for an engineer to join my group I got even more recruiters reaching out asking if I needed help recruiting and how they had great candidates. 
 
No, I don‚Äôt want to pay you $30 to $50k to help me find an engineer.  I have internal recruiters thank you. Besides I‚Äôd rather give the engineer that money so I‚Äôll spend $500 to advertise in the local professional society newsletter or website. 
 
So recruiters just stop being such‚Ä¶ aggressive, needy, begging, desperate humans. Now I know how girls saw me when I was 16 and had no game.

Most of the references and training material I've looked up notes a pretty basic relationship between number of teeth for the sun, planet, and ring gears in a traditional planetary gear setup, as follows:

R = 2P + S

That is, the number of teeth on the ring gear is equal to twice the number of teeth on a single planet plus the number of teeth on the sun. Makes sense, especially if you envision the number of teeth as diameters and the gears as circles without teeth. 

However, I have looked at two different gearsets being used in products at my company - products in productions for a longtime with no issues or problems, and each of them uses a planetary gear setup that breaks this rule slightly.

System 1 has P = 20 and S = 8, so by the equation, the ring gear should be R = 48. However the ring gear has 49 teeth, one extra tooth. System 2 has P = 26 and S = 12. Again, this means R should = 64, but the ring gear actually has 66 teeth - *two* extra teeth.

I (think) these additional teeth were added to ensure/allow equidistant angular spacing of the planet gears (each system has three planets). This is achieved by ensuring that the sum of teeth on the ring plus the sun is evenly divisible by the number of planets (e.g. 49 + 8 = 57, which is evenly divisible by 3). 

But how/why is it ""acceptable/okay"" the the first rule of R = 2P + S is ""broken""? I haven't been able to find any literature that describes scenarios where this rule is broken, or outlining by how many teeth it is allowed to shift, or detailing the potential defects/drawbacks of designing this way. And if you think of this scenario with diameters and circles, it doesn't ""work"" because the sun/planets/ring can't all be tangent at the same time. So what gives?

Does anybody have any experience with designs like this?

I am currently struggeling with a MTTF calculation for a PCB. To be more specific, its about the MTTF value of a pressure sensor. From the supplier i recieved different values, depending on the environmental conditions like temperature and humidity. We assume, that the sensor works for 90% of the time at a specific range of that conditions, while at the remaining 10% the sensor works at different levels. For example: In the 90% range (-40 ¬∞C to 90¬∞C) the MTTF is \~80.000.000h.  I also have values for the 10% range -40 ¬∞C to +125 ¬∞C which are way lower (like 200.000h).

The question is now: Is there a way to combine these two values to one MTTF value for the hole temperature range, where i can take into account that only 10% of the time the sensor has to work in the harder condition?

Thanks in advance for any help :)",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,284080,public,self,Sensor: Combine MTTF values of different environmental conditions,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/xi5m3g/sensor_combine_mttf_values_of_different/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,
