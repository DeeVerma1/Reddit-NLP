I have two (or more) devices connected wirelessly. If I know relative orientation (and they're both still), can I use a magnetometer on one to infer the position of the other device, if the other device powers up 2+ inductors (one at a time, and with a background reading) to generate EM fields?

PLEASE NOTE: For technical reasons beyond the scope of this post I'm avoiding using Bluetooth to directly infer position. I can use BT to transfer data, but don't want to use BT RSSI methods for positioning.

**WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO**

I'm trying to make two devices (about 1-3"" cube max) be able to tell where they are relative to each other. Finding relative motion or orientation is doable, but I'm struggling with actual POSITION.

The devices are IMU sensors to record relative motion over time - imagine one on each hand, and being able to tell if you're making a ""turning a steering wheel"" motion.

The POSITION doesn't need to be tracked over time - so long as one device is the known ""origin"", the other sensor(s) just need to know where they are, relative to the origin, at the start of ""recording"".

This is turning out to be really tough! They need to be wireless, range is at MOST 3 meters but usually &lt;1m. Accuracy to about 10cm would be workable, but ofc better is great.

**CURRENT IDEA OF DOING IT?**

I'm thinking of placing a few inductors in each device, presumably 2-3. If you imagine each device is a cube, one in the bottom-left-front corner, and one in the top-right-rear corner (and maybe one in the center, theoretically optional).

If wireless comms are established (bluetooth, RF, maybe ESP-NOW) they can communicate commands to each other. If the ""origin"" device listens to the other (""remote""), could I do something like:

1. ""origin"" uses its magnetometer reads background EMF to get a baseline data input
2. ""origin"" asks ""remote"" to turn on TOP inductor, just generate an EM field
3. ""origin"" reads EMF again, using that input to detect the position of ""remote"" in space (since I know exactly how much voltage/current the inductor is getting, and microteslas it's producing. I can also take local measurements on ""remote"" to tell ""origin"" what value it SHOULD be reading if the device were right there. This recording will presumably be taken over a few hundred ms to gather and normalize a lot of samples)
4. with that reading, ""origin"" tells ""remote"" to turn off the TOP inductor, waits a moment, then tells it turn on the BOTTOM inductor
5. repeat step 3, reading the distance to BOTTOM inductor
6. ...profit?

In theory, now that I know the:

* Absolute orientation of both devices
* Inferred distance to each inductor (with background EMF compensated for)

That should be enough for me to \[Math\] and figure out exactly where in physical space the sensors are relative to origin.... right?

(Edit note: this can all be determined during a calibration period which is fine to take several seconds, and all devices will be completely still during that time.)

I'm a Civil engineering student going through a career-confidence crisis, of sorts.
I'm not the first student to have this problem, and I certainly won't be the last, so I have no delusions about this. I'm looking for some outside perspective and job experience people can give on this topic, do and advice or criticism (as kind or harsh as you'd like) is welcome.

As you can probably guess, I am currently reconsidering my desired career path in college. (I have just entered my second year of college at a tech college and plan to transfer into a state school for the last 2 years of my masters; details before this are chaotic and probably don't matter.) I am currently pursuing Civil engineering with minors in sustainability and urban planning.

As some background about myself, I have wanted to design and plan cities and their associated infrastructure since I was 6 or 7 years old. I've had my back-and-forth moments here and there, most seriously changing my mind for a short period of time to Environmental then BACK to Civil Engineering after. I grew up playing Sim City 3000 Unlimited (Great Game btw), then Minecraft, then Cities Skylines, and this inspired and solidified my love of city and infrastructure design. 

(Before anyone asks, I understand urban planning is not as easy as ""Oh, plop a building here, draw a road there, etc. (Unless you're Robert Moses, lol...); just want to preempt that concept).

What you're probably asking now is, well, why not just be an urban planner? Well, I was told for a long time (and did some self research) that Civil paid better, had vetter prospects and job security, and did more of what I wanted. I figured majoring in Civil and double-majoring or minority in urban planning would be the way to go, but now I'm not so sure.

I personally love 3D design and architecture along with urban planning. I like the idea of designing livable areas for people- beautiful promenades, public transport systems, etc.- but figured I should know HOW they're built rather than just the most effective ways to put them together. What I have always known, however, us that I *CANNOT STAND MATH.* 

I HATE MATH. I've always been able to stick it out for the ultimate goal (being an engineer), but never enjoyed math at all. I saw it as a ""necessary evil"" to get to the fun parts of engineering: design. I love all aspects of design, from planes to tanks to guns to houses to tools. You name it. I love all aspects of science too! Biotech, biomed, kinetics, chem, etc. If you could take STEM and just limit it to STE-, I'd be all in. 

I never liked math but was told tips and tricks by others in similar situations to me on how to get through it, how yo slog and suffer through it to the end. They always said ""tough it out and you'll get to where you want to go!"" 

However, I recently had a moment in class today where, for the first time ever, I finally confronted that dark question I'd been pushing down: *""Is this really even worth it?""* I'd always asked myself jokingly, ""Ugh, do I have to do this, lol?"" And just slogged on. However, now I just can't stop asking ""is the slog even worth it if I don't make it to the end? If I just end up drowning in the marsh on the way there, was the trip worth it?"" I guess I'm just looking for feedback on that question, or even the answer to ""Does Civil even really cover what I want to do?"" I understand there is a big difference between an *online* job description and what you actually do *on-site/in-office*, so do you even do the planning and design I seek?

Anyways, thanks to all who read this and to all who offer words of wisdom and advice.

Hi,

So I have been in the HVAC industry working for manufacturer for close to 5 years now. I entered a management position three months ago paying decently well. Now I have always been interested about programming, which I do alot of as a hobbies, doing mostly web APIs. I highly enjoy it and would see myself working in this field in the future.

I have a mechanical engineering degree. Would you have any advice for me to transition into a more programming oriented sphere? Such as plc programming, robotics or other disciplines that involve logical thiniking/programming on applied systems.

Do you think I would need to pursue an additional degree?

Currently working on a project where I need to mechanically and electrically connect a piece of anodized aluminum to the rest of an assembly (mating part is steel). I'd like to do this with a rivet for ease of installation but it is currently being done with a type of lockbolt with special ""grounding features"" on the underside of it's head like [this](https://www.hfsindustrial.com/us/media/catalog/product/cache/8a48491d021b9c2157e289ac8605f3d7/s/e/self-grounding_bobtail.jpg).

I've seen some applications that use a blind rivet and on the blind side an external star washer and another washer on top of that. Ideally I'd like to bring this down to a single washer, but cannot find any solid washers with these grounding features for cheap. Do they exist? Is there an alternative to the double-washer method? Ideally they would have a similar grounding feature pattern on one or both sides. It doesn't seem like using a rivet on just the star washer would work (blind side head size too small).

For my application I really don't want to use the lockbolts and want to stay with a blind rivet (or other cheap blind fastener). I also cannot remove the anodization (ie sand it off).

All ideas are welcome!

However, I am still unsure as to which industry field I see myself going into after school. Would a Master's in mechanical engineering help me to figure that out?

2) Considering the fact that I haven't enjoyed my current research experience that much, would doing a non-thesis Master's program be beneficial? Does it hold less value than a thesis-based program?

3) Being in school for two more years would give me some more time to work on getting an internship or two. This is appealing because it would give me a better idea as to what I would like to do for a career.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very concerned about choosing a course that is for me, after researching came to three courses that really attracted me, which are:

&amp;#x200B;

1- Computer Science;

2- Computer Engineering;

3- Mechanical Engineering.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I listed the three courses above is because: I find it interesting to work in laboratories, or similar place, to do a lot of experiments and tests as in the areas of research and development (similar to a scientist), I like robotics and technology and because it involves artificial intelligence.

&amp;#x200B;

However, what makes me wonder is that:

a) I like to a certain extent the mechanical and electrical aspect of the robots. This causes mechatronica to lose a bit of value compared to the rest.

b) I really like artificial intelligence, I find it very interesting and it's the part where programming, coding and so on. What makes me stand between computer engineering and computer science.

c) But, even though it's not my favorite compared to artificial intelligence, I like the mechanical and electrical part a little, although it's not my main focus.

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, it goes something like this:

\&gt; Robotics:

a) In relation to Artificial Intelligence - 80%

b) In relation to Mechanical/Electric - 20%

&amp;#x200B;

I thought the obvious answer would be computer engineering, but I end up being undecided because computer engineering involves more building computers and understanding more about hardware than programming and artificial intelligence. Personally, I don't care about learning computer hardware.

my name is Gabriel  fono.

I graduated with a bachelor degree in civil engineering in 2016 in Africa ( Cameroon).  
I have been in the USA in 2017 and took an ESL class in my local community college and then started teaching myself coding to the point where I really love it and enjoy it.  
I built multiple websites and apps.  
I am currently developing another Saas application, which is a community of software engineers and entrepreneurs.  
I am currently working as a Full Stack engineer at Booz Allen Hamilton supporting the federal government .

I am also 31 years old and to be honest my dream  has been to get into MIT since I was young. I keep thinking about it every single day.

Even though I work as a software engineer , I really want to get my master's degree at MIT  
. I don't really want to give up on my dream.  
I know I am really old but I would love to have my master degree in computer science at MIT
