I have been applying for roles since graduation and have finally received an offer through a contractor. However, the role itself is very short term (about 3 to 4 months), I'm currently thinking the job could be an opportunity for growth since I haven't had a role other than an internship before but I've had some doubts if I should take the role. 

For one, I am unsure what I could accomplish in a short amount of time. The responsibilities are new to me somewhat so I feel by the time I finally get used to the role and environment, I will already be let go. Second, they want to know in a very short amount of time to accept the role which for some reason is stressing me out since I feel conflicted mentally on whether this would be the best route to take.

A part of me wants to take the short term contract role since I've  been applying for other full time roles to no avail and I could use more experience (as well as see if the engineering field is something I should do long term).

It’s where I want it, it’s the dispenser I want, i don’t want to try doing anything else unless it has these two constraints. I’m open to changing other parts to make it work. Preferably I’d like to keep the paper towel roll aligned so that I pull from the left with my right hand, but I can pull from the right. 

Pics:

https://ibb.co/album/2g2VQr

My questions:

1. How should I be pulling to put the least amount of “pull force/strain” on the dispenser? (To maintain adhesion, I hate having to fix it every few months)

2. Does it matter if I’m also pulling slightly angled up or down vs. in a direction perfectly perpendicular to the post?

I’m using the strongest double-sided bonding tape available, I’d rather not gorilla glue it but I can do that if last resort. I am not drilling it. 


Note: this is completely sincere and not satire. I simply just want to understand what I’m doing wrong and what I should try instead. Also, please trust that I’ve read all the sub rules, very diligently, and I’ve done all the searching and self-learning on this, but literally my brain doesn’t have the knack or intuition on this. 

And to preempt any “why do you care so much to understand this, couldn’t you just __________ instead” remarks, I’m going to say that it should be encouraged for people to try understand things (esp STEM stuff), no matter how obvious it may be to others :)

The Engineering Management degree certainly does not carry as much weight as the Fuqua MBA. Just feeling a little down on it, I feel like I'm semi wasting my time and money. Would it even be worth to stop? I'm 25% of the way done.. probably not.

HI! Let me start off with saying I'm just a uneducated idiot. But I have been wondering about using a system that would very the individual tire pressures during a corner to spread out the contact patch (not so much so it reduces traction) and on straits reduce the rolling resistance by increasing tire pressure. the pressure could be used to absorb race track imperfections and work in conjunction with the active suspension systems.

Its a fresh idea, so maybe some big brains can flush it out a little more or just say its a crap idea lol!

I've searched other posts about it who've recommended some companies, but none of the engineers were from Florida and the FBPE specifies things in a particular way. Namely: 

&gt;A digital signature must be unique to the Professional Engineer using it, **obtained from a third-party certification authority, and capable of verification. The certification authority will vet the PE and provide a password-protected digital signature file**. (FBPE does not approve or provide a list of authorities.)

  (emphasis added) [Source](https://fbpe.org/legal/signing-and-sealing-engineering-documents/)

It goes on to call out Adobe specifically...

&gt;You may not use the digital signature option provided in Adobe Acrobat, since it is self-authenticated and does not use a third party. However, you may use Adobe Acrobat in conjunction with the digital signature provided from a proper certification authority. 

So I looked into Revu Bluebeam, which I already have access too, but [it appears that](https://support.bluebeam.com/online-help/revu2018/Content/RevuHelp/Menus/Tools/Signature/Certifying-a-Document.htm) their method is ""self-authenticated"" same as Adobe Acrobat.

This may be a little long so please bear with me. TL;DR at the end.

I am in my late twenties and in my senior year in mechanical engineering. I got a degree in business management before studying engineering and have been working full time as a director in a non-engineering company while I complete my MechE degree. The pay is good at my current job and the benefits are good as well. I thoroughly enjoy my job but engineering is my passion and I want to ultimately work as an engineer. I am married and have a child. My wife is also a full time student and will be finishing a graduate degree in the summer of 2024 (no stipend and currently not working). I will graduate in the spring of 2023. I have been looking at different MechE jobs and the pay would be about the same as my current job. However, at my current job I get free health insurance and they are extremely flexible with schedules (work whenever, as long as you finish your work) and my job is 100% remote. I am thinking I should stay in this job until my wife graduates in 2024 so I can help her while she gets through school. Think things like dropping off and picking up my daughter at school, helping around the house, etc. Additionally, any potential pay increase I may get from an engineering job will likely go straight to commuting costs, before and after school care and health insurance as I would have to commute, someone will need to watch our child and most companies have an employee-paid insurance premium. So a pay increase wouldn't necessarily put me in a better financial position, it could even make it worse. 

My question is, how damaging would it be to my career if I wait about a year or so after graduation to get an engineering job? Would it be harder to get a job if I do this? Do hiring managers look down on this or skip these resumes? I wouldn't necessarily have a gap as I will still be employed. I have 10 years of non-engineering experience (have worked the whole time while going to college). What do you honestly recommend? I plan on spending that year building a strong portfolio (Solidworks, 3D printing, Comsol projects, etc.) and getting a CAPM certificate from the Project Management Institute. Eventually I won't mind the switch and the potential pay cut/additional expenses because engineering is my passion and I need to start somewhere but I want to do that once my wife is done with school and has started her own career as well so that can offset any changes. I would really appreciate any advice you have. 

Thank you all!

**TL;DR.** I work in a field not related to engineering. My job is very flexible, 100% remote and I get free health insurance. I'm married and have a child. I am graduating in Spring 2023 and I am thinking I won't change jobs (switch fields to engineering) until after my wife finishes her graduate degree in the summer of 2024. This is because I want to help her get through school and my current job pays about the same as a MechE job so any pay increase I get, if at all, will go to commuting costs, daycare expenses and health insurance.

So a youtubber called a tesla a chemical inferno on wheels and my first reaction to it was bff... do not exaggerate, but it got me wondering how bad it can be.

So I looked up that Li batteries can burn at ~2000 C and if a catestrofic runnaway effect would happen the pack could go up very quickly... the article I read said it could happen in seconds, but I imagine they meant for small batteries and a car battery would take longer.

The scary part is that most advice on a Li battey fire is to simply let it burn itself out when ever possible, because Li batteries essentialy create their own O2 when burning among other fun stuff.

Anyway then I remembered the Las Vegas loop and how tiny it is, the tesla barely fits and has a ~3.6m diameter or 12ft and in that small space the heat can't dissapate to anything but the concrete or what am I missing?

Anyway then I though well concrete is basically a rock surly it can hande extreme heat? I googled it and no... it starts to degrade at 100C (scary in its own way) and if the temp raises fast enough it basically explodes into bits. I think its called spalling.

On top steal melts at ~1400C. But I imagine that the concrete would have given away and the tunnel would be already collapsed before anything serious can happen with the rebarb.

I do not know, but to my laymans understanding if a tesla should have a catestrofic runaway fire in the loop then yes the tunnel would collapse almost inevitably? What am I missing? I must be missing something big. I am guessing the battery will burn itself out faster then I think and wont be as bad as I imagine. I am thinking it can last ~30-60min, but the following article said it can take up to 24h if not taken care off and I cant see any firefighter going into the loop so maybe I am actually lowballing it...

Hey guys! So first, let me just say I’m not deep into the ecosystem of engineering and I know very little beyond “triangles are a strong shape”. 

Most of my “knowledge” of engineering comes from various YouTube engineers that I watch regularly. I’ve fallen absolutely in love with the idea of thinking up a problem and having the skill set necessary to just manufacture whatever kind of solution you can dream up. Well, I wanna do that too! 

I’m still in my early-mid 20s and don’t have any set path as long as my long term career goes. I’m looking at engineering as an option to go to school for, but to be completely honest, with engineering being such a broad term, I feel like I need some direction orienting myself and figuring out exactly what kind of engineer I would want to be. Ultimately, I want to be able to conceptualize, design, and build physical objects or structures (so from my quick research, I think it sounds like mechanical engineering is where I’m leaning? Correct me if I’m wrong!)


Any advice on where to start? What kinds of classes typically go towards engineering? Would I need to go out of my way to take certain classes for certain kinds of engineering? It’s all a lot.

For a little backstory, I've been into optics and night vision for some time now. While it is a niche hobby it produces a lot of weird (and cool) side technologies.

Unfortunately, usually these niche inventions for an already small hobby community means the designs are outdated, rare, expensive or hard to make. Which brings me to my topic, ""colorTAC"". (Link to more information: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2019/08/09/friday-night-lights-colortac-cva-14-color-analog-night-vision/amp/)

The basics of analog night vision are that a tube amplifies light, both in the visible and IR spectrum, to the point where we can see very well in dim spaces. However these tubes don't distinguish or display different wavelengths of light and so you see a monochrome image. The colorTAC turns the monochrome image into color by spinning 2 color wheels very fast Infront of the objective and ocular lens. This is sort of the same way the first color image was taken, by overlaying three different monochrome images overtop of eachother.

The colorTAC has number of drawbacks though. It is large, heavy, expensive and rare. Not really a great combination of features, as even if you could find/afford one, they aren't really very good because of the weight. They also have been designed for green night vision, which makes the color green look strange through white night vision (which is what I own). This brings me to my design.

I would like to find a color changing film that can be electronically controlled with a very fast pixel response time. The faster the colors change the better. I was thinking of an LCD display with no backlight but whatever material is chosen has to allow IR light to pass through. I think I can program an arduino to than controll the 2 LCDs to quickly flash identical colors synchronized.

Can anyone think of a better solution? Does anyone know a good source for an RGB LCD without a backlight so that the display is translucent?

Now he sent the formal offer and we discovered that it doesn't include commissioning and start up work. 

How can I convince the contractor to include this work into their scope? 

We don't have another contractor as an alternative because most companies in the field doesn't seem interested in small projects. I sent several quotation requests with all the specifications and when they realise that the project is small, they disappear.

Through the research work and internship, I have done, I saw an essential problem for me. 

While I love science, I get bored with working in labs. I worked so hard, even got a good grade and my advisor was genuinely happy with my work progress. But I wasn't. I did so many hours for so little result. Sadly, that's just how it is.

That's got me realizing that a classical job in research and development isn't something for me. The question is, what are the alternatives?

Things I wish from my future job sorted in ranking;

\- a lot of change

\- career path

\- good pay

\- (traveling) (optional)

Two ideas I had so far are Consulting, Field and Sales Engineer. It is important for me that the work isn't the same and there is a lot of change.
