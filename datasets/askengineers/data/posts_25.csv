So, I feel that I wouldn't get anywhere with salary negoiating, and I can't negotiate PTO becuase it is a ""permissive paid policy"". The job is WFH already so can't ask for that. I feel like the only think I can ask for is a signing bonus - if needed I can mention I'll be ""losing money with benefits"" which is true since they match 3% less 401k, and my current PTO plan is 4.5 weeks.

Is asking for a signing bonus greedy/weird, or should I just accept? If I ask for one, should I throw out a number ($5-10k)? This is already a 30% raise than my current role of 70k, however the benefits are slightly worse IMO.

I’m a new electrical electrical engineer (2020 grad) for an older company that makes custom built fire and rescue vehicles. Part of my job requires me to revise old harnesses and create new harnesses and our vehicles change. We use DraftSight for all of our harness designing. It really is not intended for electrical design whatsoever. It has been a huge pain and time consuming to create drawings, wire tables, and BOMs as I have to do everything manually. I would like to cut down on the time I spend in front of my computer so I can spend more time supporting our electricians on the production floor. 

I have mentioned to my boss that myself and our other electrical engineer would like to upgrade to a software that is more geared towards harness design. I have watched some videos of SolidWorks electrical as it will auto populate wire tables and BOMs as you go. My boss is hesitant because you have to buy a standard SW license then also purchase the license for the electrical add on.

I have been working on my custom ebike for 4 months, and now i have the final 3 questions. I would appreciate so much if anybody could give their take or answer any of these questions if possible. Thankyou to everyone who has helped me so far on this build.

1 - is a 2k resistor for precharge enough? I did the math and ohms law I=V/R, so 84V/2000R = 0.042A which is good because i wanna trickle charge out the controller caps. but it seems like .042a is so little is that enough to charge my caps? Like in 10-30seconds.

2 - I have read something online about EMF current current in mechanical relays. Apparently when a coil stops getting power the magnetic field of a coil and push lots of voltage through a line which is why I heard something about flywheel diodes to prevent this. But do yall know if they are built into the relay or if I need to add one or if this isn’t even important.

3 - on my main wires going from battery to controller I have a EV200AAANA contactor and a JLLN class t fuse and an branch off wire going to a dcdc converter. Do I need to worry about regen current messing anything up in-line because the current is flowing backwards during regen.

* Can I display previous work done for other clients in my portfolio? What's the typical etiquette around this - should I ask permission first, or just make sure their company name isn't displayed, or not use it at all since it's technically their IP?
* Is it better to take jobs that are hourly or flat?
* Is there a point to competing with overseas workers who will work for a fraction of the price? If so, what's the best way to lean into that local advantage?
* Since this would be on the side, how forgiving is it if I need to schedule the work around my regular full-time job? How do the delivery time requirements typically work?
* How are revisions treated? Any work I've done in the past required very constant and frequent revisions, feedback, design changes, meetings, etc over the course of the project.

i have a guitar i’d like to install an extra long coiled whammy bar on. the guitar itself has an M6 threaded hole for the whammy bar, and the coiled whammy bar has 10-32 threads. i’ve been looking for an adapter with 10-32 internal threading and M6 external threading and it’s become a neverending rabbit hole i did not expect to contend with

to this point i’ve passed on dozens of parts that are almost perfect but not quite, and pulled the trigger on two parts i thought were perfect but ultimately didn’t work. the first wasn’t long enough on the M6 side, and the second’s internally threaded hex nut section was too wide, so i couldn’t screw it in as another part of the guitar was obstructing it.

it really feels like this search has been much more difficult than it should be, and i imagine it’s probably because i’m searching by describing what i’m looking for rather than searching things by name? so i guess what i’m asking is…is there a name for what i’m looking for? does anyone know where to get a 10-32 internal thread to M6 external thread adapter that doesn’t have a super wide hex nut for the internal threads (preferably in a gold color but at this point the color doesn’t matter so much)?

for context, attached picture is of the part that’s come the closest. if the hexagonal part was way less chunky and big this would be perfect. https://imgur.com/a/ENdp9x8

Obviously this is a very old design, and yes... I absolutely know that quantum leaps have been made in this arena. However, this project is part audio electronics, part... ""work of art,"" so-to-speak.  Typically any amplifier like this would be built using a steel chassis. To the steel chassis a turret board would be mounted under the chassis, and all the components would be hand wired, in a method called,  ""point-to-point"" wiring. 

I am not an engineer, and I'm barely literate when it comes to electronics in general... but I know that these old amplifiers were susceptible to noise. I know that they used to twist the wires together all throughout the design, and I know the vacuum tubes were often covered with metal sleeves. Both of these things were done to help cut down on noise. And I believe that the chassis being made of steel also helped in some way... as did the physical layout of the components. i.e. ""\[These parts\] must be facing \[this direction\], and placed as far away from \[these parts\] as possible.""  (???) 

Well... I would like to build this amplifier using only transparent glass and acrylic. This is the ""work of art"" part of all this. I want the viewer to be able to see all around inside this amplifier, 360 degrees. So, everything must be completely clear.  Before I purchase a couple of hundred dollars worth of clear sheets, to try it out... I thought I'd try to ask you guys if you already can see a huge reason why this simply won't work?

A secondary, side question is... if RF shielding must be made from conductive, metallic material... is there such a thing as a transparent material that will also shield noise-susceptible electronics?

The phenomenon can be compared to the axial stress of a cylindrical pressure vessel.

If an expansion joint is added to a pipe system, the joint will axially elongate due to its low stiffness and the presence of the pressure thrust. Also, if the (effective) inside diameter of the expansion joint is greater than that of the pipe, there will be an additional pressure thrust. If the flanges where the expansion joint is attached to are axially fixed, there will be no pressure thrust for the expansion joint and no axial elongation of the expansion joint unless its (effective) inside diameter exceeds that of the pipe.

So let’s say that theoretically, you could build a racecar that solely produced downforce from ground effect. If you’ve watched F1 you know that drivers hate dirty air, because it takes away downforce from their car. However, my thinking is that if a car produced downforce solely from ground effect, then dirty air would be obsolete. If my thinking is correct, then a car sitting in a slipstream produced by another car would be getting dragged down by less air molecules. And if I understand ground effects correctly, then the less air that there is under a car, then the more downforce produced by ground effects. So in theory, this solely ground effect based car should technically have more grip in the corners when it’s in the slipstream of another car. Is my thinking here correct?

I’ve been introduced to it in one of the companies that I worked for, and have been applying it ever since - professionally and personally (on my hobby projects). However, recently we started working with one client that is developing their embedded software using the “trunk workflow”. At first it looked quite amateur, as it’s basically the simplest workflow possible, but having read a bit more about it, maybe our client is onto something, as the “[trunk workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development)” is more streamlined towards a continuous delivery workflow with fast daily releases (in my mind that screams web development, not embedded sw!)

Going through a bit of a career crisis trying to figure out what I want to do.

I recently finished up my first year as a Business major with a planned concentration in Business Operations and Data Analytics. I haven’t gotten into my concentration’s coursework yet but will be starting next year since I’ve already completed all the prerequisite requirements.

I’ve already made some good connections and feel pretty “safe” I guess down my current path but have been questioning for a while now whether Business is right for me.

I’m looking for a good balance of technical and soft skills and am interested in the following industries: automotive (specifically with EVs), aerospace, transportation/logistics, hardware/tech (Intel would be a good example), and energy (specifically nuclear). I would like to be in a role where I feel like I’m contributing in some way to the final product or the whole innovation process. I'd like to be able to use my brain and do things that feel smart I guess. 

With the above industries, I assume that EE would be the most fitting engineering discipline to pursue.

The problem is that I’d have to transfer schools into a much harder major and I’m honestly unsure of myself on whether this is just a spur of the moment thing where I think something sounds better in my head than it really is. I just don’t know whether it’s worth taking such a risk that could cost me lots of time and money. I wouldn’t consider myself as hands on with things as some of my peers and never really did anything like join the robotics club at my high school, participate in ISEF due to what I feel was just a lack of scientific creativity, or ever use tools like CAD.

I had a 3.9 GPA in high school and felt good about classes like Writing, Physics, and Statistics. I've also now taken math up to Business Calc and have done just fine but wouldn't really say I'm ""passionate"" about it since I haven't really done much real world application. 

I’m just looking for some advice here on what you think I should do or ways to figure out what I should do from here. I wish the advice of “just follow what interests you” or “go with your gut” was enough but it’s just not doing it for me.

Feel free to let me know if I need to elaborate or if you have questions.

I don't have the budget on this project to buy a new sensor, so I have to make this one work.

The concept is easy enough, instead of shorting to ground, AKA ""sinking"", this sensor shorts to 24v+, or ""sourcing"". I've looked at several converters online, but none of them have published instruction manuals, so I can't be sure any of them will work with my project.

My sensor has three wires:

Brown: 24v+

Blue: 0v

Black: 24v Load

&amp;#x200B;

My I/O block has three terminals per input:

24v+

0v

0v Load

[This](https://www.amazon.com/signal-converter-MRI-24TR-Converter-Conversion/dp/B07P9R91TD) converter is claimed to convert PNP&gt;NPN, or NPN&gt;PNP depending on how it's wired, but I don't understand which wires would connect to which terminals. I don't know enough about transistors to understand the circuit diagrammed on the device, I only know that they can work as switches/relays.

Does anyone know how to attach all six wires to this thing? And would it actually work?

I've checked and rechecked the wiring on the terminals and the jumper settings, but there isn't much to get wrong. 

Is this unit simply defective?

Is there a better solution to this problem than these cheap undocumented Amazon products?

Could I just use the PNP sensor to power a relay that shorts the I/O block's ""0v Load"" to its own ""0v"" terminal? Or would that toast the I/O block?

I was wondering if anyone had experience with a platform that had the capability of performing several tasks, or at least a subset.

1. Using a disposable tip, laser, or easy to clean head, punch a small circle out of a card.
   1. This hole is in variable positions and will need to be adjusted by the user.
   2. This removed piece needs to fall into a small container below the punch.
2. Be somewhat ergonomic to save the user from hunching over a bench all day.

In a nutshell, the task is to remove blood which has been sampled from patients and absorbed into cards. This sample needs to be taken from these dime to quarter size circles and ""punched"" into the well of a 96-well plate below. 

We currently use this [machine](https://www.analytical-sales.com/product-category/dried-blood-spot/dbs-dried-blood-spot-card-punch/) by analytical systems, but do to the sensitivity of our tests, we are able to detect multiple patient samples in one well. Others have used an alternate format for HIV testing, using [this machine](https://www.ulsinc.com/), however, they use blood spots at the end of what looks like a pH strip, so they just nip it off (an easier task, and no we cannot easily ask collaborators to change what they're doing).
