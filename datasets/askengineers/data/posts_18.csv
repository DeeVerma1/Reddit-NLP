Why the lights turn purple has been explained tons already - Googling the problem shows up tons of local news articles explaining the problem. Essentially, these ""white"" LED lights actually use purple LEDs with a phosphor coating that glows white, and there's a flaw causing the phosphor to fail, so what we're seeing is the underlying LED color.

But one question I haven't seen explained anywhere: how did this flaw become so widespread?

Given just how widespread the problem is, I can't help but wonder whether these bulbs are all by the same manufacturer, or it it's affecting multiple (surely the manufacturer would have caught the problem fairly quickly and issued a stop-ship?). Could it be multiple manufacturers that all use the same phosphor vendor? Was there an environmental regulation change causing several manufacturers to change phosphors all around the same time?

It seems it's not caused by supply chain problems, as some of these bulbs were installed before 2020.

And then there's what's actually causing the phosphors to fail.

My apologies if I'm posting this in the wrong place; however, I couldn't think of another subreddit. If there is the right place to ask, please let me know.

I'm a rising sophomore, non-traditional (28 yrs old) transfer student at a four-year institution in the US. I initially came here to study Aeronautics and Astronautics since I've always been curious about airplanes and wanted to work in aircraft electrification at NASA.

However, the more research I do, it seems like Ph.D. is required for me to pursue what I'm genuinely interested in. Living with my 68 yrs old father, he's been working full-time to support my college journey. By the end of my Bachelor's degree, he would be 70. With the amount of stipend that Ph.D. students get (unless I work somewhere on weekends on top of the school work), my father needs to continue working until the age of 75-ish.

So, I was thinking of studying Computer Science instead because 1) I enjoy working on the CS assignments (although I struggle so much), 2) high pay upon graduation, and 3) I do not necessarily need to pursue grad school. But now my head is filled with all the stupid uncertainties, such as what if things don't work out as intended (like I suck more at it in the advanced courses), what if my age becomes a barrier (entering the field at the age of early 30s), etc. I have no idea what I want to do with my life.

Although I know that most parents are willing to sacrifice themselves for the next generation to walk a better path than what they've been walking through, I do not want to keep asking my father to support my journey along the way. It's just so WRONG and selfish of me. I want to graduate, get a stable job, and gift my father, who gave me a second chance in my life already, a peaceful life.

I don't need those fancy-ass salaries with signing bonuses, stocks, and whatever you call it. I need a stable full-time job where I enjoy, love, and the place, where we call ""home"" with my father, my wife, my kids, and puppies (or cats).

I'm designing an enclosure for some RF components for a customer that has to meet some MIL-STD-810 standards such as high and low temps, shock, vibrations, etc. The basic design is split into sub compartments with components in each that are mounted to center facing cold plates. Fans push and pull air through the center channel to remove the heat conducted into heat sinks on the opposing sides of the cold plates. My original design was a typical boxy enclosure that used 4 sections of C channel mounted to the plate and a gasketed lid to seal the sub compartments, but the customer stated that they wanted rounded corners and recessed areas to sit the RF connectors inside of to protect from fall damage or whatever. So, I made a shell and filleted the corners, added some angles to the cold plate to screw in to, and came up with the below design. Dimensions are about 18""x12""x8""

My question is, what method of manufacturing can I use to make these components? I have 2 of the lid shells and a band that wraps around the center air channel. I was thinking die-cast aluminum, but I'm not sure of the structural integrity of cast aluminum, if it will survive the 4ft drop tests that it has to undergo (this thing weighs about 30lbs when fully assembled). A co-worker told me that in his experience with cast aluminum, that it will fracture very easily when dropped. 

My other idea was for plastic molding, either ABS or other durable plastics. There was some talk about carbon fiber as well but I'm sure that's not cheap.

Hi EEs! So here is my predicament. I am going to graduate with my BSEE in the spring. I have 3 years of internship experience 2 of those years being with an aerospace and defense company which I really like. While I’m at school, I work part time doing undergraduate research and have been published in a few major projects with DOE and DARPA. While at my internship, I have been told many times over what a fantastic job I am doing and how much they’d love for me to work with them full time post graduation. With this being said, I was extended a full time offer however it was less than I hoped at $70k. This was a major hit in the gut for me as all the other engineers are started at that salary. And despite my dedication to come back and work for them every break I had away from school, it feels like my hard work wasn’t valued whatsoever. There was even a EE intern who was there for 3 months yet got an offer set at $75. I tried negotiating but they told me they are firm on the number.

My texts book says: If the power carried by a 3 phase line is P= sqrt(3) × V × I × Cosine, we can double the tension between the phases and cut in half the current and still have the same power transferred. Assuming power loss is only thermic we have Pj=R×I² and it makes sense that now we have ¼ of the previous loss.

What I can't seem to understand is: power loss is also expressed as Pj=V²/R. If we double the tension how can this make sense? If we increase the tension between the lines, don't we increase also the tension on each line as Vphase = sqrt(3) × Vlines? If on each single phase we have V=RI which is a direct proportion, how can we both decrease tension and increase current with the same resistance?

I recently got moved to a new data analytics team with the intention of more focus on just data analytics, but it has been a disaster.

I grew up in a hot country. These days, it feels like the heat is following me, no matter how far I go north. And one of the most miserable experiences there is the heat accumulation inside the metal greenhouses on wheels otherwise known as cars. I could wax poetic for whole paragraphs about the unique issues facing automobile users in those circumstances, but I'll just briefly review a few of them. Let me know if all this sounds familiar to you:
* opening the door to your car after leaving it parked in the sun for a while, 
* getting a burn from touching the car's body, which is literally hot enough to fry an egg on
* getting stuck in traffic and getting literal mirages from the sharp increase in air temperature above the crowd of cars and the black asphalt, 
* the AC becoming practically impotent to help after a certain point, and giving hou a massive headache and a runny nose besides, leaving you better off opening all the windows, safety, pollution, and privacy be damned.

Now, I suppose ""more power and capacity to the AC"" is the default answer to all these, but it would be nice to tackle the problem in a way that doesn't increase the energy consumption that aggravates it in the first place. 

## My limited understanding of how cooling is usually handled in ICE automobile vehicles:

Sometimes, like in some motorbikes and mopeds, the convection can be passive, with the coolant fins sticking far out of the cylinders, [like so](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse4.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.LmaCpjAHZ646R6uwwjt9jgHaE8%26pid%3DApi&amp;f=1).

Sometimes [the engines are placed outside the hood](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=car+engine+protruding+from+the+hood&amp;t=ffab&amp;atb=v327-1&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images).

Either way, the vehicle's passive cooling, due to the airflow that automatically follows from the velocity, is still very important, especially in the summer. 

It's the reason why engines overheating malfunctions are more likely in a long traffic jam, or when climbing a steep incline. A car that is immobile but active for long stretches of time, or moving very slowly relative to the power expended, will cause a higher temperature differential between the engine and the ambient air, for a given heat output, than when facing what amounts in practice to a contrary wind of 90 to 120 kph.

Glass windows also seem like asking for the greenhouse effect to add to the misery. With the right surface treatments, the effect can be mitigated. However, to begin with, the less sunlight makes it into the passenger compartment, the less heat one will need to dissipate. Shade is fundamentally preferable.

The way shade is usually achieved, especially when the vehicle is stationary, but sometimes even when it's moving, especially when there are children in the back seat, is to deploy foldable sun shades on the inside. These are usually an aluminum surface with air bubble ""wrap"" sandwiched in-between, which is a simple but effective design. However, as we all know, the effectiveness of this is *very* far from perfect.

Oftentimes, cars have built in ""curtains"", usually of a textile mesh, that you can roll out from the ""windowsills"" and hang to purpose-designed hooks atop the windows. This is even more unsatisfactory, but it *is* a cool-looking option to splurge on.

## What I've never seen done: aluminum fins on the outside of the vehicle. 

Possibly on the inside too, with the right design to avoid them being a hazard or a massive inconvenience, why not.

It doesn't seem that far-fetched to imagine placing a bunch of aluminum fins alongside the vehicle's body, particularly the hoods and roof. Unlike the sides, the top of the vehicle is unlikely to encounter the problems with potentially touching other cars or surfaces.

Does it greatly increase the vehicle's profile against air resistance? Not necessarily all that much. Most importantly, the key matter to consider is whether it would save enough energy, relative to the current AC-driven methods, and otherwise mitigate heat-related risks, *more* than whatever increase in manufacturing and running costs it would cause. 

I don't have that many credits in aerodynamics, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer, so I may be talking out of my ass for what follows, even more than above. 

Still, let's consider possible designs. 

If the fins are set length-wise, the contact surface with the incoming airflow can grow dramatically relative to the surface gain. That is, after all, an inescapable aspect of the design.

Alternately, suppose they were placed width-wise. This would dramatically increase the ""roughness"" of the car's surface against air resistance, but this might not be a bad thing, if it's done in such a way that it breaks laminar flow and forces a *turbulent* flow instead. [It's the principle behind the dimples on golf balls reducing drag instead of increasing it, for example](https://www.encyclopedie-environnement.org/en/zoom/the-turbulent-wake/). There is precedent for irregular or boxy car designs having this exact effect, resulting in cars that are just as aerodynamic as sleeker, smoother-looking alternatives, while also being much cheaper to manufacture. Loathe as I am to credit Tesla with doing anything right, [they seem to have achieved a good result with their ugly-ass Cybertruck.](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/turns-out-air-does-flow-nicely-around-the-cybertruck-cfd-simulation-shows-139281.html)

In fact, this may provide an additional opportunity: [with the right patterns applied to the car's bodywork, the noice of the car's friction against the air can be reduced, to the comfort of drivers as well as neighbors](https://phys.org/news/2013-10-wrangling-quiet-cars-aircraft.html).

However, this is all entirely situational, and, depending on execution, may most likely worsening aerodynamics.

However, there's one other consideration to account for: as fluid friction increases quadratically relative to the vehicle's speed, aerodynamics are at their most important when traversing long distances at high speed, i.e. intercity traffic. Urban traffic is much more forgiving. Conversely, as highlighted above, the slower the vehicle moves, the more difficulty it has conveying the excess heat into the atmosphere. As such, perhaps the vehicles that would benefit the most from this would be those spending most of their time in high-density areas and moderate-speed commutes. (If your morning commute is anything like mine, ""moderate-speed"" may be a very charitable overstatement of the miserable pace one often experiences...)",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,281661,public,self,"Hot weather car design question.

I’ve worked in engineering/construction for a decade and about to enter a desk role. I have always been paid 1.5x overtime after 8 hours per day/40 hours per week which is employment standard where I live. Now this employer wants me on salary and bank time.

Can someone explain why anyone would want banked time? I’ve asked colleagues and friends but their answers don’t make sense to me.

This stems from my belief (along with legislation) that the 9th hour of incremental work I put in is more valuable than the first 8. Similar with weekends, why would I agree to be “owed” a straight rate?

The argument my colleagues make:

1. You can accumulate banked time to take off for vacation and you will be paid during the time off.

I’m a professional, not a person living paycheque to paycheque. Had I been paid overtime for the hours worked, I would not only have 50% more pay, I would be paid immediately and the money would be more valuable than essentially a future IOU from my employer.

2. During the slow part of the year you can use the banked time. Again, had I simply been paid immediately and paid overtime, that money would have been sitting in my account earning interest. If there was a slow period, I would rather be unpaid and not come in to work, drawing from my own savings and possibly supplementing that with unemployment.

I vaguely understand the basic units of measurement and how they fit. For instance nano &lt; mili &lt; X &lt; kilo &lt; mega etc.

But because the English measurement system we have been unfortunately bequeathed is so crude, and because I am the product of the American public school system with a mediocre background in science education, I don't *appreciate the nuances* of the metric system in a way that allows me to see the world differently.

For instance, I use pounds and grams to measure weight, but when it comes to measuring mass, the English system sucks. We need kilograms in order to measure mass in newtons. Further, using the SI, since everything fits (somewhat) elegantly into other forms of measurement, it allows the wielder access to a new universe of thinking in which to understand the world. 

I want to understand what real life values an understanding of the SI model provides its more seasoned users. So I humbly come to you, AskScience Redditor, and ask that you enlighten me. Thank you.
