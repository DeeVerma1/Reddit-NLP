&amp;#x200B;

I have similar question about using level. I was responsible some time ago for registering tools in company to be used in production process, related with ISO 9001 and came across topic of legalization  (not really sure if it is proper term in this case) for level tools. So in general we bought some ""certified"" levels to be used in later QC. 

Mentioned levels have some declaration of measurement accuracy, in e.g. mm/m. That seems reasonable. However how to interpret the measurements using level? I know it sounds basic and stupid but i have seen some fancy Leica levels which specify that when the bubble is within markings means that the measurement is e.g +0.1 deg or+0.2 deg off. From what i have seen 99% of levels do not have such marking. Therefore my question is, whether there is any interpretation for the bubble being between markings? Does it mean that your measurement is within declared tolerance (just by looking at the angle seems to be far off)? Or the user shall assess whether the bubble is in the middle...

I.e., to either calculate radius increase and height decrease, or bending moment (from which the former two can be calculated).

The computers in modern cranes calculate the radius and height of the boom in real time while taking into account the deflection of the boom as it is loaded (this is true of hydraulic booms, but it has been 15+ years since I have worked with a pin-jib so I am not 100% sure for those  it i would expect so). These computers are accurate enough that a hook can be centered over a load and the operator can luff up while watching the computer's displayed radius as they take a load and hold a load steady. Thus, I presume there must be a formula that exists to calculate these variables. 

Such a formula would clearly depend on crane model and boom configuration. But I would expect that a deflection factor variable for each configuration would exist that could be inserted into a formula for calculation. I recently reviewed the operators manual for a Liebherr LTM 1300-6.2 expecting to find such a factor variable listed with the load charts or configuration sections but was unsuccessful; an operator with 40 years experience told me he has not seen one in any of the manuals he has read.

The ability to calculate/estimate deflection effects would be very useful when planning lifts, especially on critical jobs near plant or other structures. I considered reverse engineering breaking strength from the structural/stability line on the load charts to try to get a feel for boom elasticity, but I would really need to know how much it can bend. Further, some configurations have superior lifting capacity that others at a particular length depending whether sections are fully or partially extended (e.g., 0, 46, 46, 92, 92 has superior lifting capacity than 0, 0, 92, 92, 92 when in the structural region of the load chart, but has less stability at lower boom angles despite being the same length).",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,281074,public,self,Calculating boom deflection for a hydraulic or lattice boom crane,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/wlovqh/calculating_boom_deflection_for_a_hydraulic_or/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,

When I was younger I had an intrinsic respect for my managers. I was young and inexperienced and they were experienced and could teach me things. It’s obvious in this scenario why their opinions matter and I should listen to them. 

As I’ve developed as an engineer I’ve realised that the executives (generally speaking) are actually worse engineers as they’ve focussed on ‘management’ instead of the finer points of the discipline and in general have far less product knowledge. 

It seems like these people get selected by chance (or because they’re friends with someone) and not because they are the most competent person for the role. Or even worse because they have ‘management’ experience. They then enter a position where their no longer answerable and become both arrogant and lazy. 

In short.. I’m finding it harder and harder to give two shits about what my boss says. I just want to complete my tasks to the best I can. This guy has adhd and tells me to make changes to projects based on spur of the moment thoughts and this almost always results in a worse solution. He has appointed myself and two other ‘team leads’ who are all responsible for 7 people, so he in effect, doesn’t have to do his job.

Right now I'm on a project where we want to develop low voltage resin CTs for our market in Colombia. In our  investigation regarding encapsulation materials, I have encountered that the main resins used for this application are the ones built upon Hydrogenated Bisphenol A, thanks to its great mechanical properties and UV resistance.

In Colombia there is a particular behavior in this regard, where local manufacturers will mostly use Unsaturated Polyester (UP) resin for this application. From my research, I haven't found any international company using this type of resin and that has puzzled me. I believe the decision here has been price but I still can't understand how the market accepts this lower quality product.

With this in mind, I would like to ask you guys if anyone has had experience in this subject and, if yes, what do you think is the technical reason not to use UP in electrical transformers? Is it more prone to leakage currents, is it its mechanical properties? Do you think the fact that low voltage has less risks associated during its operation than medium or high voltage has allowed local manufacturers to sell products under specification without sweating it? What are your thoughts on this subject?

A final question, how do you think the situation would change if we were talking about indoor transformers? For this type, I have even encountered injection molded cases (from international manufacturers) without encapsulation inside which work as a charm. So, would there be a reason not to go forward with UP in indoor models?

Apologies if this is not the right place for this question and for the slightly vague title but I have a number of questions regarding the safety of an art installation I have been tasked to help put together.

The installation requires an 8kg weight to be dropped onto a running server from a height of 180cm. The server measures 70x50x5cm (HP DL360 G6) and has a metal casing. The plan is to create a surround using a wooden palette, and either use chicken wire or perspex. (spectators will be required to wear safety goggles)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Would chicken wire and/or perspex suffice to contain debris, provided spectators are kept at a distance of 5m? 
2. A concern is in the deflection of the rope attached to the weight when the quick release mechanism is pulled (Kong Quick Release 520). The release mechanism will be anchored to a pillar, low to the ground with the rope running up to a beam at the height of 180cm. Will this setup help reduce deflection of the weight? Is there another way to reduce the deflection when the mechanism is pulled to make sure the weight lands where intended?
3. Is an RCD style plug enough to ensure safety regarding the electrical hazard?

I overheard two guys having an argument over an injury one sustained where they said ""your gun hurts more because you shoot bigger BBs"". Everyone in the group jumped on the guy calling him stupid that a ""heavier BB would hurt more"" because every gun is adjusted to have the same ""muzzle energy"". I disagreed with that idea, taking the minority side but kept my mouth shut cause it wasn't my problem. NOW: i wanna make it my problem....

&amp;#x200B;

# My Goal

I feel bad for the ganged up on dude because, when i think about it... hes right. Despite having the same initial kinetic energy, an object of the same volume/shape but higher mass would probably hurt more! I wanna work this out into an equation of ""ouchy"". I want to use this ""ouchy"" equation to bring up to the referees at our field and point out that there should be weight limitations for BBs. Normally i don't care about getting hit but its a public field that has veterans with 2,000$ airsoft rifles (me included) up against kids renting. its not really a fun fair experience for the new players and I sympathize.   


# Known Values

Every gun shoots the same diameter BB and is ""chrono'ed"" using a special speedometer to read the exit velocity of the round. the equation for kinetic energy is used KE=.5\*m\*v^(2)  with KE=1.5 and the m being the mass of the BB. The guns must shoot under a limit where v makes the equation = 1.5.  


&amp;#x200B;

|Variable|Value|Use|
|:-|:-|:-|
|KE|1.5 Joules|The maximum limit for all guns on the field|
|D|6 mm|Diameter of all BBs|
|m|.2g - .7g|Weight Range of BBs|

For V, most people rely on a chart similar to this [one right here](https://www.airsoftmaster.com/product_images/uploaded_images/airsoft-master-fps-chart.gif) to let a player easily see their allowed FPS limit for their BB size. You can use those FPS as points of reference. 

&amp;#x200B;

# My question

How could I present an equation, at least a ""factor"" of how much a BB will hurt a person at a given weight and speed. I don't need a like ""oh this is going to hurt .5235..."" on the pain scale, i mean to just be like ""Ok a .20g BB hurts half as much as a .4"". what relation can i figure out from this? I know there is a shit ton of math i can do for impact calculations but i am just looking to do a simple factor of ""ouch"".

&amp;#x200B;

# My working theory

People at airsoft agrue that because its the same joules/energy, its the same injury. I think thats a fucking moronic statement. If i slap someone with 1.5 joules of energy its nothing, but a 1.5 joule BB to the nuts is life ruining. The actual equation to measure injury sustained is not energy but pressure: pressure at the moment of impact that causes bruising, cuts, and breaks to gear that is meant to protect sensitive thinks like your eyes. SO THEN, my equation of pain factor is...

&gt; **p=F/a, force over area, is linearly proportional to injury sustained.** 

a is the area of a 6mm BB at contact, for simplicity sake I was going to count it as pi\*r^(2) and let all BBs have the same point of area. In reality i know its probably the surface area of the BB in contact with skin as an integral of time over the impact... but heck that i don't wanna do that math rn.

This means we need to calculate force for BBs then. Well we know the joules, and energy is just the potential to do work. Therefor we can calculate the work to find the force!  


&gt;Work=Force \* distance, where distance is the deformation at impact  
\-&gt;  
Force=W/d=1.5Joules/d.  
&gt;  
&gt;Toss that back into pressure and we get  
p=(1.5J / d) /  2.83×10^(-5) m^(2)

Here is where I get stuck... d. I remember from doing car accident calculations back in like high school that if a car crumpled to 85% of its size, you used .85 = d. I don't really have a way to measure a % that someone's skin deforms... so I thought that instead, it could be said d is inversely proportional to momentum! the actual ""ouch"" factor then, as W and A are all constant, ""ouch"" factor is proportional to momentum. This leads credence to the theory that a denser object of the same volume and energy will hurt more. As momentum increases the skin deforms more, so a larger object would exhibit a larger force over a similar area. pressure would be proportional to momentum. since momentum is m \* v , but airsoft permits safety of guns by 1/2 \* m \* v^(2) then momentum goes up while energy is the same.

I'm interested in how operations like rocket launches, autonomous car testing, depolyments and decomissioning are documented from the engineering/project management side.

Say for instance, how do I write an operators manual? How should the crew document any challenges with the equipment? How do I lay out the process for a decomissioning?

I am trying to model some systems with transfer functions, but I am having some issues with ""extended phase"". 

Specifically, I am trying to take measurements and convert to 2-port networks.

In order to convert my measurements to 2-port, this requires some complex arithmetic. Multiplication and Division work fine with extended phase, as phase is simply added.

Addition, Subtraction, do not work well, since the complex numbers are converted to cartesian. Extended phase relation gets lost. Square root is another operation that becomes problematic, as phase relation is lost due to the +/- attached with the operation.

I have tried using the ""unwrap phase"" function in Matlab. This doesn't work consistently, as a phase change may not be above pi radians. This causes discontinuities in my data.

I am wondering if there are any tools, methods, or advice, on how to handle complex arithmetic with extended phase?",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,281013,public,self,Transfer Functions: Working with extended phase?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/wkzwyf/transfer_functions_working_with_extended_phase/,all_ads,6,,,,#d3d6da,2238776c-d04a-11e6-8ad9-0eff92f5bd12,dark,,,

However most are rated for 11-12v and it says there is a chip that somehow communicates with the device and requests that 12v. This scares me as Idk if I need a specific 8.4v cable. The blind spot also carried an 8.4v version but its only 8 inches and the dc side is female so Id need an extension male to male dc 5.5x2.1mm and now i run into the same issue. Do i need that extension to also be rated for 8.4v or can I just get the 12v usb c to 5.5x2.1mm and since im only sending 8.4v the camera is good because it cant overdraw more than is being delivered?  Idk where to turn someone please help!! If you need video or photos to help explain I can add those thanks in advance everyone&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'ElectricalEngineering', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2sey9', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/ElectricalEngineering', 'subreddit_subscribers': 136077, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'I need some help probably a simple answer.', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 1, 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/wkn3xo/i_need_some_help_probably_a_simple_answer/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}]",/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/wkn3xo/i_need_some_help_probably_a_simple_answer/

I always had a knack for math and science, but i was way too angsty of a teen and i ended up going to art school(no regrets) and since have done a variety of fabrication and construction jobs as well as jobs in museums and with artists.  I’m 28 and live in nyc…. it’s really expensive and working conditions suck. I’m fairly confident I could learn what i needed to to become an engineer, it’s been a while but I got a perfect score on my math sats, and always enjoyed physics.  I don’t have much money saved up but I could study with free online classes until I know enough to apply to a reputable degree. On the job site I tend to be the one to solve problems by looking at plans or figure out jigs and spatial reasoning in the wood shop. plus one of my siblings is a mathematician and the other is a biologists and i know they could help me study if need be. 

I considered a few years back going to medical school but the crazy hours for a decade made me decide against. 

the biggest thing stopping me now is not knowing what kind of jobs exactly I could get and what the hours, salary, benefits and general culture is, I don’t wanna uproot my life to find out I coulda just stayed a woodworker.  I’m also curious to know if you all are generally working on the computers all day long.

The post is about how people speed and race between stop signs, and how dangerous it is for children, how police should be there, how they should put up one of those radar signs that flashes your speed, etc... etc...

I also live on a rural road where it ends going down hill to an intersection, and right around that corner is a municipal beach park. I walk my dog there every day, the rural highway is fairly wide, but there are a lot of hills and blind crests, and cars absolutely fly by me at like 80 or 90km/h, then fly through the beach around the same where people are crossing the road, cars are pulling in and out, etc... It's very dangerous. The thing is when I drive these same roads I feel like I should be going that fast too, and people have always sped, and will always speed, it seems pointless to get angry with regular drivers for this.

Now to the question, it seems on YouTube and reddit, a popular consensus is that Europe has already figured out all of this, and that we need to curb driver behaviour with road design. Instead of 4 way stop signs, there should be roundabouts, or pillars on the road that force cars into a single lane so pedestrians can also get more visible before crossing the road. And in rural areas, the road needs to get narrower and things like trees, utility poles, etc... need to be closer to the road to trigger our brains into paying attention more and slowing down. But over here we have ""boomer"" mentality of making roads super wide, cutting things away from the roads so that cars that might go off the road don't hit them, but the result is that people feel 'safer' on wider roads with more visibility, so they subconsiously just drive faster.

We were considering what happens to a solar PV array when it is providing load and if the load has a cooling effect on the panel surface. I framed this as a thought problem:

Imagine you had two identical closed systems each containing a solar PV array. One was connected to a resistance heater and one was connected to nothing. Each system receives the same amount of solar radiation so energy input is the same. Since heat input is the same, both systems should reach the same equilibrium temperature. However, for this to happen in the system running a resistance heater, the only reasonable explanation we could come up with is that the inactive array's surface temp is actually lower than the one that is powering the resistance heater.
