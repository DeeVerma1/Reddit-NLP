I am a a senior mechanical engineering student working a summer internship for a medical device startup -- and I need some help from those wiser than I !!

As the title states, I am attempting to adhere two pieces of the same type of silicone to each other. This is obviously easier said than done as silicone is virtually impossible to physically bond to itself. The constraints are the following (Does not necessarily need to meet all):

1. The surface area that is being bonded is very small (between 1-2 mm), so the adhesive must be strong enough to only require a small amount.
2. A low viscosity, this way the adhesive can be used in a syringe needle AND the surface tension is low enough that the adhesive can spread out -- rather than remaining in large dot
3.  Ideally self curing or RTV (Room Temp. Vulcanizing) but heat cured or compound activated options would also be appreciated!
4. Most importantly : MAINTAINS FLEXIBLE AND ELASTIC, and does not become rigid like super glue etc. 

I know this is a very very tall order to begin with when it comes to silicone adhesives, let alone with these constraints. For that reason I would invite ANY and ALL suggestions that meet even one of the criteria above. 

I am currently using Silpoxy [https://www.smooth-on.com/products/sil-poxy/](https://www.smooth-on.com/products/sil-poxy/) 

It works great by maintaining flexibility, being very strong with only a small amount, and is self-curing and 1 part. 

The downside is it is EXTREMELY viscous causing small pockets of air to form between bonds, it cures very fast and does not allow time to work, and cannot be easily used in a syringe (due to its viscosity and RTV causing it to cure inside the needle). This is unfortunate because besides these, it is perfect for our application. I wanted to include this because any products that are REMOTELY similar to Silpoxy would be amazing if anyone knows of any!!

At first I was on typical lower risk tasks and projects (sourcing, build-to-prints, nothing too insanely design heavy) but eventually I was put onto one of the larger projects as a Systems Engineer. This company had never done the kind of MBSE/V Modeled systems engineering required of this project. I'm now learning what/how to do Systems Engineering alongside this company and upper management. 

I'm currently looking for a different position and I'm wondering if the limited skills I acquired with the time at this company are worth pursuing and developing further. 

I do have an interview with an aerospace company this Friday for an Associate Systems Engineer position which seemed to have a lot of overlap with what I've been doing (CFR compliance, requirements allocation, ARP4754A equivalence). Would it be better to continue down Systems Engineering or would it be better to try and become more developed in technical areas?

Honestly I'm just looking for general advice. I've had this question ever since I started doing systems engineering. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

I’m in a position to be able to purchase a piece of ranch property that has a ton of beetle kill pine, and backs up to national forest with more, and I can log that as much as I want legally as long as I don’t trash the place (yes I checked, unlimited deadwood logging costs $15/yr). This wood isn’t valuable enough to haul to the nearest sawmill 150 miles away, so I want to make money off the power company… there’s gotta be at least 50 cords/acre in this area. Incidentally, that is actually why I can afford this place, it’s a giant cheap pile of rocks and lodgepole pixie sticks with no development, but it is riverfront with forest access, and part of my loan provides for about 50k of water/power. 

I am an industrial mechanic/operator by trade with a boiler cert and 6 years of forestry work under my belt, so running, operating and even building most of it is easy for me, but it’s the choice of what system to use that bothers me. I dropped out of engineering school into water sciences when I lost my shit with all the math. 

Can someone explain the difference in energy efficiency between running a 50psi double-acting Watt walking beam engine, a system where I am confident welding it myself with scavenged parts, and I’d only have to have the steam cylinder machined (I got a layout where I use whatever alternator/dynamo I can find and use heavy duty truck/tractor parts for the drivetrain, weighted tractor wheel for the flywheel), this system allows me to install a direct drive air system where the beam can be overpowered, but pump air for itself to run off to make the system longer; a 200/160 psi piston steam engine, where I’d have to source the engine and the boiler, as I’m not high-pressure trained or certified in welding and I won’t create my own 600 psi  rated system; and a wood gasifier, where I source an old natural gas engine or modify a liquid gasoline engine to wood gas (and here, I’m going from a 97% flammable mixture down to a 30% flammable mix with a ton of nitrogen).

So I’m kind of a machine junkie, and I would honestly love to run this on the reg, and I would absolutely upgrade to more engines later on… but what do I start with, how do I go about determining efficiency/kg/$ on something like this, especially the beam engine? There is very little information on beam engines, and my goal is to run the system on iFix so I can leave it alone and walk away for a while, check it on my phone, I’ll struggle but I can program iFix … that’s why I like the beam idea, i feel like I’d have to feed the other systems way more often, and I can really build it as big as I want…

As per the title really. I'm learning Python at the moment as I want to automate several processes in my current role. I'm finding I really like programming, and programming seemingly get paid more than mechanical designers, so I would to transition into a programming role.

I did an apprentice in mechanical engineering for 4 years ( I have a HNC, no degree though), and have 6 years out of time experience. My experience includes 'on the tools' experience, mechanical design (product handling equipment, conveyors, lifts, etc...) and project management.

My questions:

1. With my mechanical experience, is there a niche area I could get into? Maybe PLC's or working something?
2. Has anyone made the jump from mechanical design engineer to software developer? If so, could you tell me about your please?

All advice welcomed. I am UK based.

Thanks

So I'm at a conference in a design competition and I need some ideas. I'll save you all the details but here's the quick summary...

Our team needs to design a ""drone"" that will travel 20 feet on while ""riding"" a string. Halfway through that journey we will need the drone to drop some objects that are a care package. The part we are having trouble with is a diy method (common craft and home Depot products) of propelling the plane that distance while carrying around half a pound. Initial idea were a rubber band/spring propeller, a spring wheel, or a cross bow catapult, etc

So my question for you all would be do you have any ideas for propulsion mechanism and if so could you quickly explain what materials we'd need.

I truly loved learning about mining and was excited to finally get my master's and start working, but in my country (Balkans), there are literally no entry-level jobs to apply to. 

All the advice I have gotten so far was about how to pump up your resume and how the nail the interview, but the problem is the lack of job openings. Of the few job postings there were (24 so far), all require 3+ years of experience. I have applied to literally all of them but either got no response or was rejected for the position. I even applied for entry-level civil engineering and mechanical engineering positions but was straight-up rejected due to not being either of the aforementioned types of engineer.

I really don't know what to do. It feels like all my hard work was for nothing. I worked for 5 years in retail while going through college and went through hell because of it. My life was basically going to college, then going to work, then coming home and studying until falling asleep. My social life was basically nonexistent. Due to hard work, I managed to have the highest average grade of my generation and even got a university stipend in my second year due to it. I did 2 internships (both of which almost physically destroyed me due to being unpaid so I had to juggle doing an internship while working 40 hours per week in retail....twice) but at the moment, neither companies are hiring. I also did a research paper as a part of the EIT RawMaterials project and spent 2 months on the European underground heritage project to renovate an old mine to be suitable for tourism. I also speak English and German (and my mother tongue). Almost all of the people that graduated at the same time (12 people) as I are still unemployed and the two that have a job were hired through the internships that they did. I even went to my college and talked to my master's thesis supervisor and 3 professors I was good with for advice, and they all basically said I just need to get lucky and find a job opening. Each one of them did write me a letter of recommendation so at least there's that. 

I feel like I did everything right and yet can't even get a chance to be in a profession I studied and have a passion for. Currently, I am still working at my retail job because I have bills to pay, only this time, I have a master's degree in engineering. This all feels like a cruel joke.

Any tips about what to do? Aside from moving to a different country, I really have no idea what to do. I even thought about going back to school and redoing my major to civil engineering (which means 2 additional years of college).

I want to bring multi gigabit satellite internet access to:

* People living in and visiting areas only accessible by air taxi. This includes northern Alaska.
* Indigenous people in less developed regions.
* Low budget crews traveling to less developed areas to help the less fortunate
* Backpackers, long distance travelers over non motor watercraft, mountain climbers, etc.
* Scientists and tourists going to the north or south pole.
* Disaster hit areas
* Areas where electricity access is limited or not there.

This is so low budget people described above can:

* Provide literacy to remote, less developed areas.
* Post and blog using recorded or real time video. This may include natural events of beauty like the aurora.
* Have reliable internet even during heavy rainstorms in a forest.
* Live over the internet video broadcast in 8K. Use of LongGOP VVC, 60 fps, 10 bits per channel, HLG HDR, and 4:4:4 chroma subsampling will be potential options. I eventually want to up it to 8K/16K with 3D light field support. This is to have true 3D for end viewers without headsets or special glasses.

**Ideas**

1. Use satellites 500 km away.
2. If one antenna does not provide enough throughput, allow antenna bonding. It can be configured like a mesh network or use regular connection bonding.
3. Hot swappable power sources.
4. Use either:
   1. The Ku band if there's a way to get 2 GHz of spectrum up and down. FDD is a given.
   2. 4-4.18 GHz for the downlink and 5.925-6.105 for uplink only if steps are taken to prevent 6GHz WiFi interference.
   3. 2.52-2.67 GHz combined with 4-4.18 GHz for downlink and 5.925-6.255 GHz for uplink. Same precautions needed.
5. A QAM level of 256 or higher. A higher level than 256 will be needed if less spectrum is used.
6. OFDM
7. Phased array antennas.
8. Intersatellite communications
9. Service sold on a wholesale basis and/or maybe first party basis. This is to allow creative but useful business models.
10. Network operators can use our gateway stations for their own networks. This is in addition to our own gateway integration.
11. Use either OFDMA or Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA)

**Questions**

1. I know parabolic antennas for satellite communications get larger with wavelength. Is it the same for flat phased array antennas?
2. Is OFDMA or SCMA better?
3. In theory, which of the three frequency band ideas will strike a balance between antenna size, throughput, reducing power consumption, and resistance to rain fade?
4. If it's better to make small high throughput antennas for already developing Low Earth Orbit projects, what can be done to ensure:
   1. The antenna can fit in a backpacking backpack.
   2. Has 1+ Gbps throughput up and down. This is for 8K/16K light field video streaming.
   3. Resistance to rain fade.

Many people have told me to use a Contactor so I was looking at them and I found a really good one from battery hookup https://batteryhookup.com/collections/accessories/products/te-connectivity-ev200aaana-500a-0-900vdc but everyone is saying I need to precharge circuit to make sure the Contactor doesn’t get switch welded in close position because of inrush current from the controllers capacitors but some people say I don’t need a precharge circuit. But that Contactor I linked has an economizer on it and people say it’s the same as precharge some people say it isn’t and I still need precharge. Just help please I don’t know what I need or what to do. Will this Contactor even work? do I need precharge? Do I need fuse or circuit breaker? So on.

This software allows the user to create and download add-ons for the software to give it extra capabilities. There is an ad on that I used to use called a lien, which basically utilizes windows built-in OCR capabilities to scan your screen in real time and extract text so that you can read text on applications that might not have support for screen readers, which is super huge and I’ve had to use this plenty of times for many applications you may Think has support for screen readers, but surprisingly does not such as steam. Basically, the idea that I had was to have a concept sort of similar to lien, but instead of just simply extracting the text, the plug-in would extract text, and then generate a little hot spot where that text was on your screen. This way, if your cursor were to enter that hotspot, it would read the text that it extracted from that area, and nothing else on your screen until your mouse over it. The use case of this would be pretty phenomenal. For example, I mention Steam earlier. Plug-in like this would pretty much make steam completely navigate a bowl from the login screen, to simply using the application in general once signed in. At the top of the Steam client, there are, as I’m sure you guys are aware, very large words to indicate store, library, community, and your account. With this plug-in, blind users would be able to simply flick their mouse to the top of the screen and locate each button with ease as opposed to having to use OCR to manually scan for text, locate the text, use the hot key to jump your mouse pointer to that location, and use a hot key to left click. Another example I can think of would be a game that I don’t necessarily play anymore, but one that this would be huge in. That game would be hearthstone. Let’s say you have a sided user playing the game. They can simply read each card in their hand and drag and drop it onto the field. However, blind users don’t have this luxury at all, and we would have to OCR every single card individually in order to read it. However, with a plug-in like this, it may be possible to simply mouse over each card and have something automatically read the text to you, which would be amazing. I don’t know if any of you feel like taking up the torch to try to make this a reality, as the plug-ins or add-ons seem to be coded in python, but I am on tens of thousands of other blind cameras with love to make us a reality I’m sure. I may try to look into coding on python as well to learn how to make this myself, but if any of you have any free time, and feel like working on a side project that may benefit people greatly, I thought this was a great idea.

(3 in sp @ 1000 cfm  rated   ≈  ≈  ≈  1 in sp @ 300 cfm, which is my desired flow rate. Unfortunately my filter did not come with a resistance chart, but it is likely to be in the ballpark of 1 in sp at this flow rate as many others state readings in this range for identical filters.) I also have an inline fan which can supply this flow rate at the given pressure, and I would like for part of this humongous fan to be enclosed within the plenum in order to conserve space, as this thing is already going to be relatively large. I have a crude drawing included as my solidworks account expired, sorry. [https://imgur.com/a/mu7JkDw](https://imgur.com/a/mu7JkDw)

The small brown squares are going to be posts that the fan sits on, similar to this build -&gt; [http://www.fungifun.org/pictures/index.php?sfpg=Zmxvd2hvb2QvKio5NDc2Y2I5ZjA5ZWY4ZGI3NWU0YmU5ODg0OWQzNjQ1MzUyOGViYWMwZjFlNWIxYzRiMzdmOTUzMzhmY2U3YWFm&amp;info=0](http://www.fungifun.org/pictures/index.php?sfpg=Zmxvd2hvb2QvKio5NDc2Y2I5ZjA5ZWY4ZGI3NWU0YmU5ODg0OWQzNjQ1MzUyOGViYWMwZjFlNWIxYzRiMzdmOTUzMzhmY2U3YWFm&amp;info=0)

overall, I'm looking to get 300 cfm @ 1.2 in sp flowing out of this filter (extra 0.2 in sp for pre fan filter), but I'm worried that the fan being so deep inside the plenum will cause a zone directly adjacent to the top of the box in-between the fan and the filter with lower pressure than anywhere else, which will ruin the laminar flow.

Looking around it seems like going from process -&gt; quality is the opposite direction that people usually aim to go for, but in my case it seems like I'll be doing more interesting work in quality, and I find statistics/DOE/hypothesis testing much more interesting than dealing with the processes of a specific tool.
