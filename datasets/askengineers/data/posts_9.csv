The Ring! I view it as such an important and sacred thing! I know a few friends that are engineers and are doing things regarding the ring that leads to my questions: 

Is it seen as acceptable to get your iron ring permanently inked in your skin instead of wearing it?

What about proposing to your significant other that isn’t an engineer with it, as a symbol of both being important? 

How about letting someone wear it for a day because they’re fidgety and we’re anxious? 

Do you keep your ring for your whole life or are you expected to pass it down to someone else at some point?

FYI, I say ”propulsion-less” not in the strict sense but in functional sense. I am not certainly picking a fight with Newton’s third law.

TL;DR: You store the momentum of your propellants as photons on the trapped surface of a singularity.

An electromagnetic singularity is created e.g. by focusing lasers onto a small enough volume. An electromagnetic momentum pair is created e.g. by annihilation on its null surface such that one falls into the black hole and gives it and the vehicle momentum, while the other photon gets caught in the singularity’s trapped surface.  While the singularity maintains its form, the former photon continues travelling with its momentum intact, while still *effectively* stationary. Thus achieving thrust without emitting “propellants” (the photons). Breaking is achieved similarly. At any point, the singularity may be allowed to decay via Hawking radiation, releasing the trapped “propellants” whose momenta may then be recycled.

I imagine the details get very technical but it seems to me that the issue here isn’t the violation of conservation laws but more issues of feasibility and getting lucky that universal constants are “just right”.",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,283381,public,self,Concept for propulsion-less drive that conserves momentum,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/x980lr/concept_for_propulsionless_drive_that_conserves/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I have a Nei 32NE4000 TV. It's not a smart one, it was controlled by a remote with a little LED at the top of it.

As you can see, I am not into this field at all, so this is my issue: the remote does not work anymore. I think I accidentally sat on it and it will not power on the tv anymore. I've tried changing the batteries, I took it apart and coated the circuit with some graphite from a pencil I had around ( I remember my dad used to do this when I was a child) but it still will not work.

I have an app on my phone that lets me control a lot of things, like a remote. I'm sure you're familiar with this: you select what you are trying to control, the brand/model and they give you different configurations to try and see if any will work with your device.

Currently, we have a big model on Simulink, but it doesn't takes into account the thermal components. It has a simple formulation for cooling/heating the passengers, but none for the other systems (batteries, motor, fuel cell...).

Our next step is to implement the thermal systems and apply some thermal management on them, hopefully optimising their components and control.

We are not sure yet if we'll do it on Simulink/Simscape or SimulationX. I've tested both, but some definitions of the components are incredibly different, specially on the heat exchangers. I'm a big user of matlab, with little experience on heat exchangers, while the thermal team has no experience in modelling. One seems more focused on the usage of the component, while the other on its development. 

Has anyone had any experience with any of these programs? Even better if both. Even better if on thermal management! What's your opinion on them?

The geometric quantities known mean I know what the angular displacement will be based on calculation of the arc length based on the two points on the circular motion known, so Theta is known.

So if I take the CG to be at the center of the rod (d/2) and do a torque balance, friction at the pivot point is not included as it acts on the point of rotation. Drag force is negative since it forces a clockwise motion, and mgSin(Theta) is positive as it induces a clockwise motion, and I am assuming a CD value and density value for a flat plate at sea level density and planform area is known (A)

Setting up the equation of motion to include drag force and gravity:

Torque = (d/2)mgSin(theta) - (d/2)(1/2)rho(V^2)CD*A

IP is moment of inertia of the rod, convert V to L*Theta

Quick background of the project. there are 2 steel beams that have corroded for over 50 years that need to be desperately replaced. as the new guy i’ve been given this job. 

i’ve already thrown together a replacement steel layout that is going to be put in place. my problem now is trying to figure out how to move forward with replacing the beams. 

the problem is that the old beams need to be removed in order for the new steel to be installed in place, so i was thinking you need to shore/reshore the slab while you remove the old stuff and install the new stuff. the problem is i’m a mechanical engineer and while i understand the concept of stress and strain it seems way more complex than what i’m thinking and i cannot figure out how to determine an adequate shoring method that proves the slab will not collapse and ruin equipment and shut down our facility. i’ve found a lot of documentation concerning the shoring and supporting of pouring new slabs during construction but this slab is 50 years old and quite frankly in bad shape anyway. so i’m having trouble correlating the concepts. 

a company we do a lot of business with says that they would engineer the shoring for 1500$ but my boss said no to that and it’s up to me to run the numbers. and as a mechanical engineer dealing with concrete reinforcement i have low confidence since i have never been thought about concrete in the slightest (graduated this year)

i’m not asking for anyone to solve this for me i just need to know if there are any books/standards/procedures or literally any other info that can help determine shoring and supporting existing concrete slab. i’ve been looking at it for a week now and im really drawing a blank
 TIA!!

I am in a bit of situation this past week. So I have been looking for a new job in product development/design field and I got an in-mail from this HR at a reputed Engineering consultancy. I applied for the job had my first interview on 28th July, it went great. After that I didn't hear anything from the guy, upon further enquiry it turns out that he is on vacation. Now he contacts me again and arranges 2nd interview on 2nd sept with the technical lead. This 2nd interview also goes great, the manager and I built a good rapport during the interview. then the third interview on the next day with the ""account manager"". It also went great. 

So now the HR calls me in the evening telling me that I have been selected and they will send a draft contract on Monday. So I wait anxiously the whole day, but he calls me at 7.30 pm and asks me about some details needed to make the contract. So far it's been two whole days I haven't heard back from him. One thing to note is that he never sent me any email saying that I have been selected or that they will send the contract. He told me all of that on the phone. He also mentioned that he needs to send that contract to his higher-ups and once he gets approval he will send it to me. 

Now my anxious level is at its peak and I can't focus on my current job. 

is this normal? or are they just playing with me? Has anyone been through similar experience? Do companies work this way ?

So far I’ve done ductwork diagrams. Pipework sizing. Walking around construction sites with tradies. I feel like I’m doing everything I did a masters to avoid. 

Should I stick with what I’m doing now? try and build my career inside a big firm?  There is potential to get involved more in the energy modelling side of things. Learning how to use rhino, grasshopper and ai software. Which is good. But it could be a very small part of my job. 

Or should I just quit and try and find something else. I do worry that if I spend too long doing this stuff I’ll become pigeon holed and stuck with no transferable skills to the areas I’d like to be in.
