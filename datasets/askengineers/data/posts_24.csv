So I recently graduated as an ME and I'm working as a process engineer for a well known manufacturer in the Midwest. My job is a great position for a fresh engineer, but I'm not crazy about the area.

I went to college in a somewhat small community in Michigan's upper peninsula. I really miss living in the middle of nowhere and being able to explore legitimate wilderness whenever I wanted. I would love to find a position someplace similar in Montana, Idaho, Utah, or wherever.

I guess oil &amp; gas is the obvious answer, but I don't really want to be involved in that industry. I wouldn't have a problem with mining. My ideal industries would be alternative energy or aerospace. I've even looked at engineering positions with contractors in Antarctica, not sure I'd really be qulified for anything down there.

I have an issue that seems to be counter-intuitive.  

I wanted to test to see how much fuel economy I lose when towing a small utility trailer at highway speeds.  So I tested my vehicle without the trailer for two runs.  Then I tested with the trailer for two runs.


The methodology I used was to fill up at a local gas station. Once the auto stop on the nozzle goes off, I wait 30 seconds, then I press the nozzle one last time for it to auto shut off again.  I reset my trip odometer and did my tests. I drove back to the same gas station and pump. Re refilled the tank with the same method above. Then I read the pump reading.


I drove 2 loops. Both having one loop with the trailer and one without. One loop was 46.4 km. The second was 50.6km.


The results are as follows:

LOOP 1 (46.4km):

No Trailer: 6.8 litres to fill up.

With Trailer: 6.1 Litres to fill up.



LOOP 2 (50.6km)

No Trailer: 6.9 litres to fill up

With Trailer:  5.5 litres to fill up.



Now I know I'm an idiot in many things, this may be one of them. But I can't understand why I'm using less gas with the small trailer.


The trailer is 200kg itself with a 50kg rooftop tent in the bed that is raised 60cm off the bed floor with 4x4 wooden legs. I also had various other items in the bed totalling around 100kg.  Could the rooftop tent be acting like an air foil of some kind?


Unless I'm doing something completely off, then it seems I should always have my trailer attached to my SUV when highway driving. Or have I messed this up that 'm coming to the wrong conclusion?

My question is, would it be a huge leap of logic, or downright impossible, for a government with unlimited resources to retrofit my villain's exosuit with compact versions of these technologies that could be deployed on his enemies in a combat setting?

Hopefully this is a good place to ask.

(So here's a diagram)[https://imgur.com/72adOXK]
(And here's a real version of it)[https://imgur.com/yFm3MUt]

The screens traverse horizontally and vertically, sometimes diagonally when combining the 2 systems (the upper wires haul it up/down, the carriage underneath tracks).

The issue is, when the screens track at speed (~800mm/s at the fastest), they obviously swing, then impart that swing into the truss/lines above, gaining me 2 pendulums initially, then 1 very big pendulum after they reach the same frequency.

They continue to swing for ages. That is then compounded by the next tracking move, and the cycle starts again.

Does anyone have any ideas on how I might elegantly go about at least dampening some of that sway?

I've already given generous accelerations and decelerations to the movement, and suggested slower moves, but creative minds and physics aren't a great combination apparently.

I've considered:
- Making the lines for the second drift to the screen more rigid. I don't think this will work because I think the uppwer lines initial counter swing acts as a dampener. I think this just adds more stable mass to the whole pendulum.

- Adding a tank of water or something to the back of the screen, I think it kind of achieves the same thing of the initial dampening, but will eventually just add more mass. That said, the initial big swings are my primary concern. I am also mildly concerned about sound from water sloshing around.

- Shortening the drop. The screens are suspended on 6m lines below the truss, shortening the drop will reduce the pendulum, but seeing the truss when the screen is dropped in to the floor isn't acceptable.

- Adding elastic guide lines for the top truss to track along. I think this one will do a lot to counter it, but the winches driving the system are powerful, and I'd rather not rip things apart if a truss swings into whatever outrigger etc I'd need to place under the truss to make it work. It could not go to the ground.

However I am concerned about strength of the wishbones I am designing. My materiał of choice is carbon fibre, and, due to the speed goals it needs to be quite aerodynamic thus my choice of shape for the tube crossection is oval. The tube's axis will be about 2.5cm X 5cm with wall thickness of 3mm (the longer axis being horizontal and shorter being vertical)

Now, is that the best design? Is the oval shape overkill, since aerodynamics would be negligible here, and going with round tubes would be just easier?

Since bicycle paths in my country are basically red coloured pedestrian pavements, you tend to hit quite a lot of curbs on the way (when passing intersections). They are usually quite low (2-3cm high), but sometimes there are rougher obstacles to overcome, so I figured the suspension will need some X axis strength. 

Don't I overdesign this part as well, since the forces involved wouldn't be that high and should be lowered by the tyres anyway?

First time posting here sorry if I'm in the wrong category but I figured some of you might have some knowledge to help me on this.
I'm building a window mounted exhaust fan setup for my kitchen just to have fun but I can't get it working. I've got a 12 volt 180 watt fan, and I purchased an alleged 240 watt 12 volt power supply but everytime I connect it the fan starts spinning and then stops. Voltage at the PSU seems to drop close to zero. Remove the load and I get 12 volts. This unit allegedly outputs 12v at up to 20 amps.

Weird thing is I have a smaller 12 volt power supply that will turn the fan on without a problem but that one is less powerful, 5 amps at 12 volts.
Before this current PSU i tried cheaper ""LED driver"" power supplies rated for 200 watts and the same thing happened, they moved the fan a bit, then stopped but those never fired up again.
Any idea what could be the problem here?

Up until now, I had been thinking Electrical Engineering with a minor in Physics. However, having learned about Materials Science and Engineering at my university, it has caught my attention. It goes deeper into Physics and Chemistry than EE does which excites me. This would also make a Physics minor take less extra time since there's more overlap.

I'm looking for my first full time position after college. Currently, I have 3 offers, but none that I'm really passionate about. I was supposed to make a decision today regarding the offers, but I was contacted by a recruiter in the morning for a position as a robotics engineer, which is my dream job. Unfortunately the interviews start next week, and I made it clear to them I need a decision from them by Wednesday. When I talked to the employers of my current offers, two of them said they can only postpone the offer to Monday. Right now I'm deciding between risking it and just interviewing for my dream job or just accept one of the offers and be done with it. I might be able to postpone two of them if I beg, but I'm not confident. I spoke to the recruiter and he said that I should call their bluff and let them know I need more time, even going as far as suggesting I give a little white lie about how one of my interviews today had to be delayed to the next week, so I need more time. Regardless I'm not sure what I want to do. I'm young, so I'm sure I can transition to robotics eventually, but I have motivation issues and I would like to work someplace I'm passionate about. I've been unemployed since December, and my money is running out so I need to get a job soon. 

I should also elaborate on my current offers. The first one is the one I dislike the most, but they messaged me they're willing to wait until I interview with the robotics company, so I guess they're my failsafe. The second job is the longest commute (45 mins), but is the largest company with the most stable work environment, so I'll be learning a lot from other people. The final offer is the shortest commute (20 mins), and is vaguely related to robotics, but I will be the only person on the team, so learning is more of a ""sink or swim"" deal, which means it has the most variance in terms of my performance and enjoyability. I might be able to postone this offer, but only to Wednesday at the very latest.

I also realized that the recruiter may not be entirely truthful with me. He said I was the talent, and I had the power in the negotiations, so I should be able to flex it and ask for more time, but that could just be him trying to gas me up so I can consider them more.

The way I see it, if 2nd and 3rd offers don't give me more time, then I can choose to either pick either one of them, or let them expire and roll the dice, but that might end up with me not getting an offer from the robotics company, and being stuck with my first offer, which I like the least.
