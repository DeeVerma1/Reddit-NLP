I have limited options to move it to another non AFCI outlet.   And no, I don’t want to get rid of the AFCI as much as that would make my life easier I stay in code.

So I added a Tripp lite IS 250 isolation transformer which is rated to 2.1 amps and the wine cooler has continuous rating of 1.5amps into that.   The wine cooler has a max rating of 10amps.   

So right now plugging the cooler into the IS250 is working better.   But it still triggers the breaker at least 1x per day.

There are isolation transformers that go up to 10amps but they cost 800.00 

I found an IS 1000 that goes up to 8 amps.   Was thinking… what If I plug one isolation transformer into the other one then plug in the cooler?   Will that give me 10 amps of coverage?

At least compared to the spinning disk I understand that neutrons are slow relative to the Uranium. I like the low vapour pressure of UraniumDioxide.

Shouldn’t we still not pump the water with the neutrons to the top, to let them drop into the dust? Won’t neutrons scatter a lot anyway and find the exit before they induce a fission?

Wouldn’t it be better to extract fragments using beam lines for charge particles instead of random bouncing? How does random give the fragments and exit advantage over the neutrons?

For a large engine, beam lines would merge like a tree and the beams need to be cooled in the transverse direction. I think, we need shot noise for this. This would funnel fragments out of a closed reactor.

How is the dust different from a single sheet pointing down? 100% of downward impulse ( fragment, gamma, neutrons) go out.",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,281303,public,self,How can the Fission Fragment Rocket Engine (FFRE) reach critical mass when we usually need to press fissionable material and also need to mix it with a moderator?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/wnlsn4/how_can_the_fission_fragment_rocket_engine_ffre/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,

In multiple jobs, I've been in a position as a mechanical engineer on a team of 10-20 engineers made up of electrical, systems, and mechanical engineers, and have usually had a role as a ""technical lead"", essentially an informal manager, in charge 1-5 of those engineers and with responsibility for the detailed designs/builds/tests and reporting up to the actual manager. I think it's kind of necessary on larger teams, but I've had some positive experiences in this role as well as some negative experiences. If you've also had similar experiences in roles like this as either the manager or the informal technical lead, I would appreciate some feedback and opinions on this structure. Specifically some areas I am interested in getting some feedback on are:

* As the informal manager/tech lead, the biggest struggle I've had is ambiguity in responsibilities and who the lower level engineers should report to. There's always been unnecessary tension created because of not trying to step on others toes. What are some ways that people have had success in solving this issue?
* If there's a strong technical lead in the role, I feel like it usually creates a bit of a wall between lower level engineers and their actual manager on paper. Is this is a problem? Are there ways of balancing the relationship between lower level engineer and tech lead and manger?
* What are some examples where this structure was really successful and how was that accomplished?

Hello there fellow EE lovers,

I am rn in phase of thinking where to enroll for college and have a lot of options on the table. My qualifications are perfect gpa, highest possible in my country as well as career in sports playing at a professional level in 3rd division league in my country. 

Where i live our HS system is made so we have different High schools for different professions, so there is Medical high school, EE high school, Mechanical E high shool, Grammar school which is like your American high school experience, Economics HS and many more different high schools. Each high school then has different programs like a college would. I finished EE high school, power engineering program to be exact. I have also some work experience in the field. 

And i am now looking for my next stop: college, right?

Well my current thoughts are that i find the best possible college i can find, wherever that college is. I am fluent in english and am ready to take IELTS tests if needed.

And now i can finally get into the point of this post, since this is a EE subreddit and there is people from all over the world with different experiences in many various places and colleges i was hoping you could kinda narrow my choices. 

I looked up college rankings for EE in general and best college in my country is in 400-500 range ranked, then there is another one from neighbouring country about 700ish range ranked and another one from my country that is in 1000-1100 ranking range.

I guess i could attend the 400-500 one but i think i can get much much better education with qualifications. i was mainly moved by some of my friends talking about great colleges in top 100 while i had the best qualifications compared to any of them,
by miles better.

So after some looking and examining the best colleges i am rn thinking of going to a college in England. USA has great colleges but since i am from Eastern Europe it would be way too far for me to go there to study. Idkn, maybe it wouldn't but england feels like a nice middle ground. Because i wouldn't need to learn another language from grounds up and could just perfect English if it's not enough to pass IELTS, or maybe not even that. I am still not sure on what level my english is.  

Do you have any suggestions? Maybe someone that studied ee in england could help me? Imperial College London or something like Harvard looked like a good place i could attend. I am interested in EE, specifically Power engineering with possibility of getting a Masters or a PhD. Also maybe with option of a minor degree in buisness. I would be interested more in opening a buisness containing Power Ee.I would be open to other places in europe as well if they have in english programs.

Also what are the best colleges for power engineering?
Power engineers what colleges would you reccomnd?
How much does your knowledge change depending on college you attend?
Maybe students from some of the best colleges could help with their experiences?
Any help?

We can talk about it more in comments, give me your opinions where i should go, what to study...

Honestly i am also looking for best colleges so i can have my knowledge being aproved in whatever country tommorow i'll be working in.

Engineers address concerning-data, using the tech available, to design a system to do it.

I'm working on a project to implement CAN bus using infrared communication as a physical layer. I know it's probably not a great idea, it's just research, if it works it probably won't be fast or long range but that's besides the point.

In order to implement this, I have these DFrobot IR transmitters/receivers: [dfrobot.com/product-351.html](https://dfrobot.com/product-351.html)

I'm using two raspberry pi's, with these CAN hats: [https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RS485\_CAN\_HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RS485_CAN_HAT)

Now, the CAN hats work, and direct wired communication between the two pi's works fine. CAN bus is a differential signal, and I want to use it to trigger the signal on the IR transmitter/receiver. In order to do this, I need to convert the CAN signal into a 0-3.3v simple TTL signal. This, seemingly, should be doable with a CAN transceiver like this: [https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/3/3a/SN65HVD230-CAN-Board-Datasheets.pdf](https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/3/3a/SN65HVD230-CAN-Board-Datasheets.pdf)

Now, I am not even trying the IR tech yet. What I am trying, is to connect these transceivers on either end, connect their tx and rx together, and seeing if CAN communication still works. It does not. The Pi's are able to bring the network up, but messages simply are not received.

To clarify, the system is connected together like so: https://imgur.com/Wv0dCd8 

I've tried various configurations of terminating resistors, and direct CAN hat-CAN hat communication with the Pi's works.

It's hard for me to figure out since the worlds move and the engine would accelerate to some point of diminishing return. Assume that launching from Earth and slowing down won't be necessary please.

Let's say we want to create a 24v system, so we put two 12v batteries in series. Let's double the capacity by adding two more 12v batteries, wired in series with each other but wired in parallel with the first two batteries. 

So, now we have a 24v battery pack with a greater capacity. 

Now, let's discharge the system to 12v nominal. If all four batteries are equal, they should all be at 6v. So, now we connect those four batteries in series, bringing the system to 24v nominal. 

Okay... I know this all works **in theory,** and I know that it could be done in practice. What I don't know is:

1. Can this be done in a usable way? If so, how? (Relays? Some type of automatic wire switching connector?)
2. What kind of capacity should be expected after doing the switch? My understanding is that batteries are usually manufactured to maintain voltage for as long as possible, but when it starts to drop, it drops fast. So, if it takes one hour to drop from 24v nominal to 12v nominal, how long should it take to drop down to 12v after the switch? Another hour? Half an hour? Fifteen minutes?
3. Is there any type of battery where this is safe to do? I know lead acid batteries can't handle it. What about LiFePo4 batteries, could they handle such discharging?
4. Is there a better method of doing this? Like, say using three batteries per bank (36v system) and three banks, and then doing the switch (different wiring, of course) when nominal voltage goes down by a third?

Any help on this is appreciated. If you know any references to source material where I can learn more about this idea, please give the reference(s) in your reply.

Surely it would be easier for construction and design purposes if everything was consistent, why go out of your way to change it?   


I’ll offer my best guess - if the road the ramp comes off of has more people turning right onto it and few people turning left, less people would have to change lanes if the the left lane merged into the right.

My assumption is the increased resistance of the coil wire would lead to less idle power draw and greater efficiency, but if the voltage remains the same then there would be less current flowing through the coil, but the increased number of turns should multiply the strength of the magnetic field... so I'm not too sure. I couldn't find anything online talking about what the number of turns does.

I'm interested in the idea of heating a 3D printer nozzle with one of these (ignore for a second how little benefit this may or may not introduce), but coils made of thick wires and few turns seems impractical and inefficient.

I saw that the LVLs were not flush with the ceiling and it seems that it was ripped length-wise. The ripped side looks uneven and is the side that meets my ceiling.   


Was this beam installed incorrectly and is this dangerous?

And have been working for about a year now. I am looking at going back to school so I can work in the field I actually want to.(propulsion systems in the aerospace/defense industry) 

I am looking to hear from people who currently work in this field. What did your educational and career journey looked like until you were able to land a job working in this field?

I have looked at job postings in this field to see what the top skills that are required but most are pretty generic. ""Must be able to do x,y,z"" ""have an understanding of a,b,c"". This does not really tell me what someone qualified for this position actually had to do to be able to perform these functions/understand these topics.

 I am currently messing around with ANSYS to learn how to utilize simulation software, and I am looking into getting a solidworks certification and ANSI GD&amp;T certification on the design end. I did well in thermo and heat transfer and got my EIT. But I do not use my education day to day at my current job and I feel the longer I stay at this job the harder it will be to transition into a different industry. (I work in sales engineering in the engineering department)

At this point I would like to know what sort of masters programs should I be looking at? Will a generic masters in ME really help me? Or are there masters programs specifically for propulsion systems? What are some of the software that really helped you stand out and land that first job in the industry? How long after your bachelors did it take to land that first job? What sort of entry level jobs (not necessarily in this field) should I be looking at where I can learn valuable skills/knowledge that will eventually help me transition into the industry? 

FYI I have applied to entry level jobs in the industry, I am not qualified atm. 

Thanks in advance and again I am looking for people who have personal experience in the industry.",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,281118,public,self,what did your educational and career journey look like before landing first job in propulsion systems?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/wlzqy9/what_did_your_educational_and_career_journey_look/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,

I work in the engineering department where my job is to basically keep projects moving forward, communicate with vendors and customers on engineering items/deliverables, and create 2D and 3D GA's to ensure fit up and determine points of interference. (First job out of college had to take what I could get after pandemic cancelled my internships and competitions)

The sales engineers (all degreed engineers) do site visits and propose the initial solution and equipment needed.

A continuing pain point is that often they are unable to visualize if the equipment they propose will actually fit. I know it's hard to be on the spot in front of a customer but we have drawings/models of like 90% of what we offer unless it is completely custom.

I was wondering if anyone knew of an AR apps or products that work with solidworks. My goal is to find something cost effective and relatively easy to use so we can send them models and then they can use AR to get a solid visualization of the equipment in the space it will go. (Think stores that offer a ""see it in your space"" function that uses your phones camera) 

I saw Arki which is definitely along the lines of what I am thinking but it only works with .FBX files.
