With the recent warnings that electricity is gonna be **really** expensive this winter, maybe it's worth a shot.

Basically, just put a big bucket of water in the freezer. Once it's frozen, you throw out all the ice outdoors, and refill the bucket. All the heat that was in the liquid water is now in the house instead, meaning I *must* have gained some free heating. Theoretically, this works great. In practice, I have no idea how to even approach a calculation to determine if it's a reasonable thing to do at all.

Some parts are simple. 10 liters of water seems like a manageable amount. It will provide about 1 kwh as heat as it freezes, plus a non negligible amount from cooling the water. (Enthalpy of fusion=334 kJ/kg, 10 kg = 3.3 MJ = 0.92 kWh.)

I have a fluid mechanics exam coming up and our study material is... not ideal. One of the common exam questions in our ""solved problems"" script isn't solved. As it's a very common question on exams so I'd like to know if I understand it.

The problem goes like this: A liquid flows in a wedge 1 m long and 0,5m wide. The wedge decreases in height (x axis), it's 50mm tall (X0) at point of entry (1x0,5x0,05) and 30mm tall (XL) at point of exit (1x0,5x0,03). Its' velocity is given by the equation V=2\*4mps (maximum velocity)\*(X/X0-(X/X0)squared)

Determine the volume flow (cubic meters/second), average velocity in area and average velocity at exit point.

If I understand the problem correctly, the volume flow should remain the same from point of entry to point of exit, calculating this would then allow you to determine the average velocities. The velocity should increase as the wedge decreases in volume.

I am currently working on contract and will probably get a few more publications over the next couple of years.

Only issue is that I don't see much stability as a physicist, finding jobs for my profession is extremely hard, especially in theoretical stuff, and all the jobs are contract-based so I always have to be planning my next move after a couple of years.

I have considered some engineering jobs here and there which are often in the electronics/telecommunications space, but I have noticed that they usually have the same kind of expectations:

\- Expertise in &lt;insert code standard here&gt; for design and testing of &lt;include specific system or device here&gt; 

\- Expertise in using &lt;multiple commercial software packages&gt; for the design and simulation of &lt;specific stuff&gt;, schematics of &lt;something&gt;, Multiphysics simulations (e.g. COMSOL)

\- Experience using CAD modelling tools like SolidWorks, ANSYS, etc.

Obviously I do not possess any experience in such things nor can I acquire it since a lot of this commercial software is unaffordable (and even non-accessible) for individual users. Most jobs I see in R&amp;D engineering seem to include some permutation of these requirements, on top of things like Python+MATLAB programming (which is the only relevant skill I do have)

My question is more about the mechanical side.

If I have a gear drive train ( lets say the power supply is a weight )  what is the best way to go about researching how to get the best efficiency for a long term output. I understand eventually the gears will need to be rewound and most likely ill need high torque on the output to charge a battery, however I can't seem to find any books about this going in depth. 

I know the formulas for gear ratios and all that but I feel like I'm missing the more in depth explanation of how to get a gear train so efficient it requires minimal maintenance but will provide a reliable output.

I haven't begun the math yet , but I'm assuming I would need to start with a large gear then size down to produce a higher rpm, connect that shaft directly to a larger gear. Is this stupid or is that effectively the same power as the source gear? I feel lost.

I don’t really get interviews anywhere else other than utilities and similar things because my experience is all in that. 

There’s no way I can stay in this. Eventually people are gonna realise that I have 0 passion for the industry and I look for every opportunity to avoid work right now, which is the opposite of who I usually am.

I don’t enjoy what I do now so I’m very keen to move out of the role. 

I had a chat with the director of the team. He said I sounded like the perfect fit. Then an interview with 2 of his team members. They said they want to get me on board asap. The director then 2 weeks later said they were ‘looking to get me on board as soon as possible’. He then handed it over to his colleague to get me moved over. They told me to tell my current team about the move. 

It’s now been 2 and a half months since then. I message her once a week asking for updates. Most of the time she just straight up doesn’t respond.

A month ago they said that there has been some complications with how they didn’t realise I’d started a new role 4 months before and wanted to ‘make sure it was the right fit’. So they wanted another now in person interview. 

This then got cancelled and to be rearranged ‘for some other time’. There were ‘now concerns about a junior member being remote’. Even though they said once a week in office was fine. It’s now been 3 weeks since then. Last week I messaged and she ignored me. This week I messaged and she said ‘apologies, I’ll try to call you this afternoon’. She then did not call me that afternoon. 

I don’t know what to do. The issue I’ve found is that my current team now don’t trust me. So I’ve been written out of their plans. I don’t even know if I’ll have a job in this new team. But the opportunity to get out of this area of engineering is big for me.

So my house has three power sources (Grid, Solar, 26kWhr battery) and three power sinks (Grid, Battery, House use). Net Metering is no longer available in my area so we charge the battery during the day, and discharge at night. The power controller acts as the traffic cop for all this, and my question is: How does it direct the energy between the sources and sinks? 

This all happens seamlessly, For example If the solar is producing 5kW and the house is using 3kW, the extra 2kW will go into the battery. Let’s say I start the electric dryer or plug in the car (5kW additional load for easy maths), this will flip to 8kW to the house, with 5kW from solar and 3kW from the battery. This happens immediately (well within human ability to notice). If the battery is empty or full or providing it’s 10kW max output, the grid is used to make up for the slack or take the excess. 

So what’s actually making this happen? It seems the swings are to great to just “up the voltage” on one of the sources, and in the case of the grid this can’t be controlled by my system(and I think the solar and battery are both configured for constant voltage of 240V/60Hz). 

My best guess would be the controller has the ability to lag/lead the voltages by just enough to make the current flow only from the sources desired? That is to say shift the frequency ever so slightly out of phase in a manner that makes the flow happy.

I'm the manufacturing engineering with a urethane casting company. I'm working on a project to create a difficulty classification system for our molding process. Goal is to balance operator load by mold difficulties, and in the future it will be a variable the MES uses for scheduling.

Some background, we run 4 machines to 1 operator. When scheduling a part no tangible information is used to determine what mix of parts the operator will run. This has caused major inefficiencies in our process. Parts which are ready to be demolded will sit for 20+ minutes while they are working on another part. 

How the process works, Operator dispenses material, additives, pigment, and curative. Mixes together and pours the material into a mold. Material is allowed to set up, then lid is closed and pressed. Material cures to green strength and part is ready. Operator demolds parts. Prepares the mold by cleaning, installing inserts, and release. Process starts oven again.

Factors I'm considering
*Material mixing time (1.5 - 8 min)
*Material Pour and close time (2 - 10 min)
*Demold time (0.50 - 15 min)
*Mold Prep Time (0.75 - 10 min)
*Mold Weight (20 - 250 lbs)

I've played with multiplying the considerations by a factor of 1-10. But some molds that are easier to process than others will end up ranked worse, after a few iterations scrapped that plan. The mold weight is what throws the whole system for a loop. I've played with range scales which give mixed results.

So, i was reading a book that claims that ancient egyptiand had more advanced technology in order to cut stone, by an engineer called Christopher Dunn. He claims that a particular rock could only have been shaped in a concave way wit a compound radius with the use of circular saws, and he has some arguments to reinforce his claim.Among them from his book ""Lost technologies of ancient Egypt"":

1-""As seen in figure 10.25, the striations wander slightly from a true straight or curved path, but, inexplicably, each of the striations wanders in the same direction as its neighbor and follows a parallel path. This does not support the view that abrasive slurry was at work to create these marks. It seems to be powerful evi¬ dence that fixed cutting points that are set into a rotating cutting tool were acting on the surface. ""(page 276)

2-""One suggestion made to me was that the blade that cut the piece was a straight saw but that it was warped and cut the curve on the stone face. If that were possible, it would explain one radius on the block, but whether you view the block from above, or along its length, you see a radius. When considering this and pondering on how this inexplicable geometry was cut into the granite, the straight saw has to be eliminated, because it would be impossible for it to cut a concave radius along its face and along its edge.

I am ""non degreed"" and got my training via my uncle who is a well regarded PE, along with the work force since the age of 18 (I am in my 30s now)  , the other guys are degreed.  One in particular graduating from a top 10 school in california.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I was recently put on a project and partnered with one of the younger kids. It is his first job out of school fyi. We basically did some parts of a project separately and then combined our detail sheets at the end.  

&amp;#x200B;

He opened mine up and said ""ok change yours and make it look like mine"". In a rather sort of disregarding way. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spent a great deal of time on my drawings as there is a lot going on and I tried to make it as clean as possible. I avoided redundancy, called out items once with a ""typ."" note if they are called multiple times within the drawing etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also recently funny enough posted on here about how exactly holes and cuts should be shown correctly within a drawing.   I was told by some folks that my holes should be dimensioned in relation to each other if they are paired or mated with holes on other parts. Prior to this I was basically calling out my holes and showing each one from the edge of the sheet metal/material.  I came to learn that this was incorrect or maybe not the best since I was not highlighting the critical dimensions, which is the spacing between the holes or cuts, since this is specifically related to the function of the part and how it is mated or constrained to other parts within the assembly or overall product.  

&amp;#x200B;

However the coworker I was partnered with wanted me to change my dimensions to his format, which were all shown with their location relative to the 0 point. In an ordinate style.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to look thru my companies prior drawings and saw that others as well as the top engineer in the company over the past 10 years...all make their dimensioning similar to mine. Simplifying duplicate dimension, avoiding redundancy, and calling out dimensions that are specifically related to the function of the part.

&amp;#x200B;

I kind of was upset because I felt this kid thought he was right by default since he graduated from this awesome school...and automatically wanted me to change mine to his.  Btw he also had a bunch of lines intersecting and his sheet was pretty messy. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But maybe I am missing something?

Anyway, am I correct in how I am 

dimensioning and thinking of my detail sheets or am I wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

I kind of felt offended to be honest and I guess I am insecure since I am the only guy without a degree...

&amp;#x200B;

I told him I wont be changing it and told him why. I then told him he could change his to match mine but its probably not a big deal...

So in my work in engineering research, there was a free 1-year training program for accountancy since our work is under a university that offers this free program annually with free slots per new project. Since no one was taking it, I volunteered for it. The modules of it are as follows: managerial economics, financial accounting and reporting,  economic development, accounting standards, and cost accounting.

I  wanted to ask you guys if you know how these skills can be applied to  work inside and outside the academe and how frequently are they used.  I'm curious since I really don't have an idea about accountancy. It's  only engineering economics that I know of in my past course works which  are usually for the time value of money. I'm asking here since most of  what I see in search engines are accountancy vs. engineering which really doesn't help.

Thanks for answering.",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,282902,public,self,How does accountancy skills help engineers/engineering role?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/x3yzk7/how_does_accountancy_skills_help/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,
