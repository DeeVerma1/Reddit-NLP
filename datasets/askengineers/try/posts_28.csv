They didn't really give me clear communication about what the expectations were, and a few weeks ago I was abruptly told that my work wasn't meeting expectations. I was given a couple of weeks to deliver results, and although I put in the hours and knocked that out (and was told that I had done well with the ask), my boss said that they were ""expecting more"" than the bullet point list, and so I was let go. I'm still feeling a lot of anger around this that they had three months to give me direct feedback and left it until they felt like we were hitting a wall before they made that clear.   


I'm not going to have a problem getting interviews even if I left the four months as a blank spot, but I have to say that I'm unsure if that's the best course of action. I did some excellent work in those months, learned a whole new CAD package, delivered some great physical prototypes and simulations, built some good relationships, and I'm proud of what I did. I gave 100%, and at any of my previous companies I feel like I would have received accolades. I even filed a couple of patent ideas- but apparently I wasn't proactive enough at probing \*exactly\* what the manager had in mind for me, and I took the periodic mild feedback (could you show more hand calcs in reports, could you do more in-person meetings) as the extent of desired corrections.

I notice the airflow out of the window is pretty high and really hot. Makes sense. I also, notice that cold air is gushing out of the AC. So the net airflow is out of the room, meaning there is low air pressure in the room, meaning the air in here somehow is replenished. Where does it come from? The seal around my window isn't perfect, so some there, and I assume the rest is from adjacent rooms.

Because we are multiple people here, run powerful computers, and are doing the laundry, cooking food etc., the temperature in the flat is 25C, while outside it is only 22C. I'd love for it to be 22C - fast.

**Then it dawned on me; the inflow of 25C air from the rest of the flat was a negative to the whole process, and that maybe opening the window to let in 22C air would cool down the room faster. Is this correct?**

I'm asking because you consistently hear that you shouldn't open the window when using the AC.

Well, I accidentally added a small amount of SAE 5 air tool oil &lt; 5% detergent composition.

Am I screwed? Can I get a new felt sponge? Or just add some heavier non-detergent oil to dilute it?

The other is software engineer at another big non-FAANG company. I would be taking about a 10% pay cut for this role, but it'll be in LCOL, so probably more or less the same as my current position.

I don't love rf engineering. I mostly just liked studying it in school. The job itself is okay, but I'm often working 40-50 hours, and I don't think my new position will be anything different after speaking with the manager.

Many of my friends in software engineering are only working 15-20 hours a day and remote. Of course there is crunch time, but there's also crunch time in rf engineering. I think my longest week was 60 hours. This made me pursue some software positions. 

My biggest goal is making more money per hour, which software seems to allow. I know people think that your job function should be something you enjoy, but I personally think my job environment and culture (remote, flexible conditions) is more important than the function. I don't love software engineering (did some self-learning, so maybe not indicative of actual job, but the closest I'll get). But for me, the job is just a tool to survive and pursue my own hobbies, which are prohibitively expensive.

I think taking the pay cut now would allow me to pursue higher salaries in the future. At the same time, I feel like a fool for turning down a FAANG offer thats 40% higher than my current salary. I have some anxiety about this decision, because I know the market isn't too hot right now for software engineers, so I don't even know if they'll enjoy high salaries again in the future.

Sales and finance team run this company.

The parts we design go through absolutely no testing (""does it fit, yea? Okay cool""). 
There are no standards followed other than experience.
Engineering dwgs follow no standards. 
Engineering design is mostly listening to what the fabricators did and turn it into a drawing.
Some engineers may design or redesign their own components but undergo no testing and go straight to the customer.

There's only a handful of engineers here all mostly new fresh grads with the exception of 1 or 2 higher ups. 

The production supervisors and staff don't listen to engineering much. We can implement LEAN, Six Sigma, and other methodology, but no one will do it because production does not want to or people find it stupid.

So pretty much we are cad monkeys/ project managers(looking over certain builds being made in time). But the lack of influence and power engineering has here feels ridiculous. The high ups see engineering as something corporate just threw in here and unnecessary.

I'm handling thermal testing for a heating element to be used on a vehicle in arctic conditions (Approx. -40C ambient @ Approx. 60MPH).

I'm trying to relate thermal chamber testing (close to free air/non-forced air) to highspeed conditions (forced air).

From what I can tell, the relation would be tied to the Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient, but for air it varies wildly in reference material (I have very little of it).

&amp;#x200B;

Numbers I'm seeing for ranges are:

Free Air : 2.5 - 10 \[W/m^(2)K\]

Forced Air :  20 - 500 \[W/m^(2)K\]

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, this wide variance could greatly skew how I handle fault conditions and I'm looking for some opinions on these characteristics.

&amp;#x200B;

Note, I've done the Google, which is why I'm here.

However, According to a brief conversation, our building retooled all the locks and distributed new keys 2 years ago. Looking closely, I can see what appears (to my eye) to be an abnormally high stress concentration. The number of times you have to use the key in this building is frankly ridiculous. On average, each time one goes outside, including to take out garbage, compost or recycling, it's \~3.5 cycles. I'd estimate at minimum the key has seen 2500 to 12 000 cycles based on what I know about the previous tenants and the uncertainty on the ""2 years ago"" estimate.

I took a macro photo of the tip of a (still good) copy of the key. The thick part at the right side is 1/8 inch, and the ratio at the thinnest part seems to be 0.072, so I calculate a thickness of 9 thou (0.23mm). 

To me, this seems very weak, and I'm not surprised that it's cracked already under 10^(4) to 10^(5) cycles. I don't have a solid grasp of lock mechanism design, so am unsure of loading patterns and I also don't know what sort of material or heat treatment keys generally have.

I know that generally you should use threaded inserts when you want a thread in a ""soft"" material (aluminum, plastic) but my question is what range of what metric is where using inserts becomes suggested/required? For intance is there a specific material hardness, elastic modulus, applied load vs strength, or anything else like that? 

I am making a device where a non-conductive material needs to be threaded, both for screws to attach another structure, and for a set screw which will be tightened and untightened &lt;50 times. The screws will only be bearing minor shear loads, but the set screws will have 3\~ lbs axial loads. Though I haven't chosen a material yet, the part will likely be CNC Milled so I'm currently looking a common non-conductive materials for milling like ABS or Polycarbonate. Ultimately I am not very familiar with inserts so I'd like to avoid using them if possible, but I also want a device that works. How do I know if I need to use threaded inserts or not?

Someone that creates/takes ideas, and goes through the entire process in order to turn them into something that is 'real'. Is anyone able to point me towards the name of this kind of role within the industry? 

For those that are willing to do a bit of reading:

# Skip these 2 introductory paragraphs if you like, they're just here for context.

So, let me start by saying this: I love diagnosing faults with cars and fixing them. The more involved the job the better. But after almost 4 years in the trade - I've realised that I can't stand the monotony of the maintenance side of things (90% of work I currently do). I hate following routine-work like general vehicle health inspections and servicing. I hate following the same process over-and-over. I'm not bad at doing inspection stuff (I don't cut corners, or carlessly over-look things), but I do take my time with constant breaks because I struggle to motivate myself to just get it done.

I also dislike that I **ONLY** ever do hands-on stuff - as I really like to be forced to use my brain too. Number-crunching, creating, designing, testing. Iterative processes, basically. New problems, new solutions, new outcomes. But, I also do still thoroughly enjoy getting my hands dirty and getting stuck-in too. Actually physically 'doing' something is satisfying and fulfilling in a way that can't be matched simply by solving a theoretical problem. Assembling/buildng things is most fun I guess, but I don't dislike dissasembly or replacement of parts either.

# So, basically, I'm looking for this kind of style of work:

* Constantly working on new projects. Minimal batch work. Each job would preferably be unique. Bespoke in a way. I don't mind long projects though - as long as I know that the end of it is inevitable - and something completely different will follow it.
* A balance between hands-on, and going back to the drawing board. Utilising both skill and knowledge. It doesn't have to be 50/50, and I don't have a preference either way - but there does need to be a decent mix of both. 70/30 either way would be fine.

All of this points me towards prototype-style work. A research and development kind of thing. But I don't want to just be working at specific points of development. I'd like to see things through from the very start to the very end.

For example, it would be my dream to operate a company that designs after-market parts and also tools - both for road cars. I also have some interesting ideas for stuff like gym equipment too. I like looking at something and thinking ""this is good - but I could make it better"" or having an idea and thinking ""how does X not exist yet"". Just innovating, I guess. I think it would be fun to cater to specific wants and needs aswell. Someone might wants a unique custom body kit for their car - or they might want us to design a brand new and unique engine for them. No demand too large (as long as the financing is logical, obviously). 

I know that there are custom car shops that do tuning and stuff - but 99% of the time you're just bolting on pre-existing parts as part of different stages of a 'performance package' and stuff. Don't get me wrong, I would tolerate that a lot better than what I do now - but it's still not the exact thing that I want to be striving for. Something that will maybe be good to get involved in before-hand though. I do think the custom tuning side would be more my sort of thing though to be honest.

I wouldn't want to do stuff like F1 though, because I don't like the seemingly arbitrary regulations. A road car has real genuine requirements and restrictions that you need to work around - but there is simply much more freedome in what you're allowed to change, modify, and create. 

Idk, working at Novitec or Koenigsegg seems like it fits this kind of criteria. Bespoke innovations kind of thing. But I think even then, you'd never really truly see anything from 'start to finish'. I guess I'd have to work somewhere that operates on a smaller-scale, or within a very specific department.
