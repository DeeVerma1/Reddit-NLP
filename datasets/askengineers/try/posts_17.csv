I graduated with a bachelor degree in civil engineering in 2016 and worked as civil engineer for about two years and really love my job .

then , I switched career in software engineering since I wanted to work in the software company where I could design software for civil engineer and now I have been working as software engineer for the past few months.

I am still earlier in my career  
I am planning  to build a social network for professional civil engineers, students and entrepreneurs where people could share their experience , knowledge ,  journey , education and innovation in the civil engineering niche.

my goal of this platform is the connect all the upcoming and professional civil engineers all over around the world so that we have different approaches in the civil engineering field.  
I want all upcoming and professional civil engineers  to plan meetup anywhere around the world  and discuss topic about the future of civil engineering

I want people to be able to learn from other , start their own busness and innovate in the civil engineering industry.

I would love to know if it is something I could invest my time building it 

please let me know   
I would really appreciate any response and advice

I look forward to hearing from you

The device should raise and lower a piece of material from in front of a projector's lens. When the device receives a signal (***x***VDC) the device rotates to one position. When the signal is absent, the device returns to it's home position.

I started looking at servos, but as I'll have a single binary on/off signal, this isn't it. Further I only have two set points. 

What's the name of the device I'm looking for?

I work at a large defense contractor. However, I have been waiting for my clearance since the beginning of my job (2 months). All I've done is sit at my desk and do nothing or ask to work from home so I can do nothing there. It is getting frustratingly boring. My mentors are too busy to help me (mainly because they don't want to assign me unclassified work just for me to abandon it when I get my clearance). My manager is great and understands the situation, he tells my mentors to give me tasks but nothing has happened. Additionally, I am across the country away from friends and family.

I have been recruited a decent amount and am starting to consider options in my home state. Companies like Tesla and start-ups have been reaching out for higher paying positions, even adjusted for cost of living.

Would it be bad for me to leave my original company for another company three months into my first job? Especially since my clearance may come in any second now (given previous applicants timeframe). I haven't learned anything valuable so far and I fear that I will not learn as much at a large company as opposed to a company like Tesla or start-ups. Would this burn a bridge? If so, what are the odds I can return maybe a decade from now? (Company has great work-life balance.)

Lastly, should I wait til an End-of-Year performance review before considering jumping ship?

Thanks!

TLDR: This is my first job, but I want to move closer to friends and family with higher pay after 3 months.",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,281895,public,self,Leaving Large Company after 3 Months for Smaller Companies,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/wtikfa/leaving_large_company_after_3_months_for_smaller/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

Side A: Believes that the vehicle's alternator is subjected to increased mechanical resistance when there is an increased electrical load in the circuit that the alternator supplies.  For instance, if the driver activates all of the vehicle's accessories (headlights, radio, heated seats, defroster, etc), this camp believes that the increased power draw will affect the internal resistance of the DC generator, requiring the vehicle's engine work harder to turn the alternator.

Side B: This camp believes that the internal resistance of vehicle's alternator is not affected by the amount of power consumed by the circuit it supplies, and that vehicle accessories have no effect on the amount of torque required to spin the rotor to generate a specific output.

Which, if any, side is correct?  If you don't mind, could you also provide an explanation?

I have ruled out converting to leds because I want the exact illumination characteristics that are standardized for this device with halogen bulbs.

My thoughts are to use a constant current, constant voltage DC power supply which gets its power from a 3.7v lipo cell. I would use a DC boost converter to increase 3.7v-4.2v up to 6v. I would use a potentiometer to adjust resistance which affects the amount of current which adjusts the halogen's brightness.

What mundane task have you automated out of pure laziness?

I have a spreadsheet that contains data. This data is used to populate models in a software. Within the spreadsheet are string concatenation functions to write the appropriate syntax needed by the software. However, to apply this data to the software I need to physically copy and paste those strings into another document. This is the step I didn't like. It's not hard, I just don't like doing it.
