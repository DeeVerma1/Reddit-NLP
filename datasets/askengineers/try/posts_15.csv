Whenever I ask this question, it is always someone in management that answers like ""Oh well ideally we do want to get there"" Or something close about how those numbers get averaged out because of better efficiencies on some days.

I'm a ""build-in-place"" kind of guy, but this is my first actual engineering project where I don't trust simply looking at something and saying ""Good enough!"". My plans are a 12'x6.5' frame, ~4.5’ tall cabin interior while towing, then telescope up to ~7.5’ when parked. The basic plan is a portable ball screw assembly that I can use to lift the roof from the middle of the camper. I'll have linear guide rails in each corner with the rail bearings attached to angle iron, then fix the angle iron to the roof frame.

https://imgur.com/TIP8E83 - Extremely crude diagram for guide rail/angle iron in corners

https://imgur.com/B7EgoGD - Slightly less crude Floorplan in case it helps visualize

I'm building a foamie hybrid, using 2"" foamboard insulation and poor mans fiberglass for most of the structural integrity, incorporating wood framing only where necessary - windows, the exhaust fan mounted on the front, and a sparse roof framing to  connect the angle iron risers and distribute the load when the lead screw is raising the roof. My napkin math has the roof coming in around 400# when it's all said and done.

From what I've read, the problems come from two places. 

First, the roof has to lift evenly or it may bind. The mattress I want to use would prevent me from lifting from the center of mass. If I'm lifting from 1 foot behind center, the load would be about 60/40. Should 25mm guide rails be enough to keep everything in-line?

Second, and this is the big one, I have no clue how to account for wind. I think everything will be fine while towing since the roof is lower and my tow vehicle takes the brunt of the force, but I don't want to be worried about keeping the roof up on a windy day. I could see either the bearings or angle iron as a weak point. I know spacing the bearings out further decreases the torque(?) force, but the more I space them out, the less I can raise the roof. The roof panels are 4' tall, I'd like at least 3' of travel on the roof, which leaves me 1' max spacing on those bearings. With the angle iron, I know they're very strong against directional forces, but terrible against twisting. Would 2""x2""x1/8"" angle be sufficient provided all 4 corners are connected with framing?

I know I'm a bit out of my depth here, but I'm hoping if this idea is bad that y'all can provide some adjustments to make it good/workable. Or if my entire concept is ill-conceived I'm hoping y'all can tell me now before I waste who knows how much time/money on this.",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,282249,public,self,Is my plan anywhere near viable?

I have been considering getting a masters degree lately, but all the mentors I speak to keep giving me more reasons against it than for it. The main reasons I want to get a masters are - more knowledge in my field to be a better engineer, allow me to transition out of health tech and into renewables, expand my network. 

As my mentors have pointed out, I can study and become more knowledgeable in whatever I desire on my own time. A class and a professor aren't necessary. Masters are expensive and usually not funded (at least not fully). And I can expand my network by just working in my field. And two years of work experience &gt;&gt;&gt; 2 years of a masters, for many reasons. 

However, they cannot give me a solution on how to get into renewable energy as a mechanical engineering with experience in health tech and product development. Most job postings I have seen require knowledge on electrical engineering, knowledge that goes beyond circuit analysis. I have some light experience through my various internships and current job in electrical, mainly coming up with a basic circuit for products, doing some actuator work, programming and hooking up microcontrollers, etc. Nothing in the realm of power or transmission. 

So my questions are - would taking and passing the FE EE exam count for something when applying for jobs that require EE knowledge? Would it count enough to make me a candidate for such jobs?

I'm struggling to conceptualise the difference between the two. Conceptually, people will say ""Pressure is how hard water flows, and flow rate is how much water flows"".

To me ""how hard water flows"" is a function of waters mass flow rate and therefore its the same thing?

If I stand directly in front of a pipe outlet, and the water is coming out at 15 l/s, then surely its the mass flow rate is what is causes me to feel 'how hard' the water is flowing against me? 

I don't understand how pressure would even come into that equation? What difference would it make if the water was coming out at 3 bar vs 4 bar? 

I sort of understand the pressure is related to flow, so because of the increase in pressure will cause an increase in flow. But why does this impact 'how hard' the water is flowing? How hard the water is flowing is surely dependant only on the mass flow rate?
