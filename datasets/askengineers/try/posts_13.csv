I'm the original owner and it's in great shape still.

I've been using the same Bluetooth/FM Transmitter for the last 3 years.  The device plugs into the cigarette lighter adapter to receive power.  Phone connects to the device via Bluetooth, and the device then transmits the audio over FM.

For the past 3 years, I've had crystal clear audio with zero static.  I just have to make sure I select a free radio frequency with no local broadcasting radio stations.

Skip forward to about a week ago, suddenly I'm getting a ton of static over the FM transmitter.  I can hear the audio from my phone, but just barely over all the static.  I try the rear cigarette lighter adapter (there is one in front and one in back), same exact behavior.

I assume the FM transmitter died and bought another to replace it.  Plug in the new one.  Exact same level of static in both the front and rear cigarette lighter adapters.  I then cup my hands around the FM transmitter and as soon as I touch the device, the static goes away and I'm back to clear audio.  Let go, static once again.

Just to confirm whether it's the device or my car, I take the FM transmitter and plug it into another car.  Clear audio, no issues.

As far as tuning into radio stations, I get perfectly clear audio just as I always have on my favorite stations.

I took the car into a mechanic to investigate a grounding/electrical issue and they could find no issues with any of the ground points or the alternator.  Everything tested fine.

Here is an example I pulled from online.  (Source:  [RSS Tolerance Chain Stack up Analysis – Learn How to Perform Assembly Tolerance Stack up by Root Sum Square Method - Bright Hub Engineering](https://www.brighthubengineering.com/machine-design/56403-assembly-tolerance-stack-up-analysis-using-the-rss-method/) )

    Assume you have 4 plates with thickness and tolerance as follows:
    
    • Plate 1 = 27 ± 0.4
    • Plate 2 = 15 ± 0.3
    • Plate 3 = 15 ± 0.3
    • Plate 4 = 15 ± 0.5
    
    If we assume Cpk = 1.0 then the tolerances are equal to 3σ, so to find the standard deviation of each part, the tolerance is divided by 3.
    
    • σ1 = 0.1333
    • σ2 = 0.1
    • σ3 = 0.1
    • σ4 = 0.1667
    
    The formula for the ""assembly"" standard deviation is the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual standard deviations:
    
    • σ(asm) = sqrt(σ1^2 + σ2^2 + σ3^2 + σ4^2)
    • σ(asm) = 0.256
    
    Therefore, to get the tolerance band of the assembly at 3σ, we need to use 3 x σ(asm), or 0.768. The nominal thickness of the stack is 27 + 15 + 15 + 15 = 72.
    
    Thus us the RSS tolerance band becomes 72 ± 0.768.

My question is this:

What if I have parts that I know the actual Cpk values for, and want to use those to help the tolerance stack? 

For example, say I know **one** of those blocks (say Plate 4) has a cpk = 1.33. 

Then my new σ4 becomes 0.125 (instead of 0.1667) because we divide the tolerance by 4. 

This yields a new assembly standard deviation of σ(asm) = 0.231.

Now here's where I get confused. The new assembly st dev is smaller, which is expected since one of the parts is now more reliably close to its nominal. 

But if I want to find the new tolerance band for the whole assembly, do I still just multiply the new σ(asm) by 3?  Or does it somehow change because not all of my individual components are using a 3σ distribution now? Or does the assembly have its own Cpk, which determines the number by which you multiple σ(asm) to get the tolerance band?

I kinda see his point but I don’t think materials science should be compared to those two other degrees

I'm writing my bachelor's thesis and working at an aviation company. The topic of my thesis has a lot to do with explicite FEM. Right now im trying to do a simulation of a shell model and I wonder: How much of FEM do you actually understand and how much of this understanding do you apply in your job? An example I thought of spontaneously is the difference between the fully integrated shell elements and the Belytschko-Tsai shell elements.

Another example would be the various ways to define a composite material in your program (I'm using LS-Dyna right now). Do you know which is best or do you just try out new things, debug and improve?

Another example question would be do you understand the meshing algorithms?

I'm genuinely interested, because we are mostly young people at my company and I was hoping to ask somebody who has more than 10 years of experience. I think I came to the right place.

Please keep in mind that this is the question of a person who has less than 6 months of experience and is struggling with his thesis.

I’ve given them a lot of opportunities to provide work that maybe fits better with my career goals. They’re a huge firm and I thought they would have something. But after a lot of stress and just frustration, they’re clearly not going to provide it. 

My skills are mainly engineering simulation using FEA and CFD. Can use solidworks for 3d modelling. But I can also code in python and currently learning c++. 

I want to find a job where I can use these skills. But I’ve now got no industry experience in it because of the job I’ve been doing. 

I’m not really sure how to fix this and I feel really stuck. I’ve applied a lot but I just get easily beaten by all the other applicants. They’ve all got better experience. 

Has anyone got any advice on how to go about fixing this?

I have a (uni) project that I'm working on. My project is about designing an aquaponics system. The fish I am using requires me to heat the water. I am required to supply figures for energy consumption. 

I have two choices when it comes to water heating: 

1) Heat the water all the time so that it is at 25C.

2) Heat the water to 25C, turn off the heaters, and then turn them back on when the temperature reaches a specific threshold (lets say 22C).

To complicate matters, I have two cases:

1) The area of the system that has the losses due to evaporation is exposed to the elements (i.e. no protection from wind or sun, low humidity. For this case, losses due to evaporation are not negligible (approx 150L/day)).

2) The area of the system that has the losses due to evaporation is protected by a greenhouse (i.e. next to no wind and high humidity. For this case, losses due to evaporation can be considered negligible).

The water lost to evaporation is replaced immediately with water that is at ambient temperature (18C, for example).

I would like to compare the energy figures for both configurations in both of these situations. 

I have run into one problem, though, and I've been unable to find a model that can help me (maybe I'm not looking for the right thing. This is a bit out of my area of study (I'm doing electrical)). I would like to know if there is a model that can tell me how much energy I will need to heat water at 22C to 25C but the model should also consider the rate of evaporation. Does such a model exist?

I know their are intro classes that I will take that will lead me to what is the best fit for me, but I was wondering if you all could provide some insight just based on my background and perspective.

I have a pretty non traditional background. I am a high school math teacher but have a liberal arts degree, so at this point I have a pretty solid and flexible understanding of fundamental high school level math concepts. I have also been fortunate to acquire effective written and oral communication skills that are helpful for professional communication and problem resolution. 

At the most personal fundamental level, I am a problem solver. I believe that every problem has a solution and often look at issues from more perspectives than the average person. I think I am just a very well rounded person at this point, and although in a way I wish I had just started off trying to be an engineer, I think that my career path has allowed me to grow and mature as a whole person, and I can bring a different perspective to the field. 

I do not think I want to work with spreadsheets all day or be a computer programmer. While I would not mind doing some of that in the day to day and learning those skills at a higher level, I think I am more interested in figuring out how things work on broader scale. For example, I would rather oversee a whole project or system with tedious elements than do anything exclusively tedious. Despite my aversion to minutia, I am careful and look over whatever I do because I care about functionality and quality.

In the first system, we have no valve. The pressure at point A is 1 bar, and between points A and B there is a pressure drop of 0.1 bar, so the pressure at point B is 0.9 bar. There is a pressure difference if 0.1 bar. 

In the second system, we have the same pipe system again but this time we also have a valve that has a pressure drop across it of 0.5. Therefore, the pressure at point A is 1 bar, and at point B 0.4 bar (1 - 0.1 -0.5). As you can see pressure difference between the two points  is higher in the first system, but wouldn't it have lower flow since there is a valve creating a pressure drop (I.e, it will affect the system curve on the pump - and make the pump produce a lower flow rate). 

Is 'pressure difference' = increased flow rate only relevant only when considering the system as a whole? When does this apply?

&amp;#x200B;

For example, in system 2 there is a higher pressure drop. With a fixed speed pump this means the pump will have a reduced flow rate since there is increased resistance on the circuitbut it doesn't make sense if you examine each valve individually. 

Any thoughts?

I am a car enthusiast. I have purchased a tap kit a while ago and I found it very useful. I am currently looking at putting studs at various locations. Since I am now capable of drilling and tapping holes the size I want, I figured I could choose pretty much what I want.

Some background information. Unless specified, all my measurements will be in metric because it's easier for me. I will be mostly working with cast iron, cast aluminum and mild steel from \*insert whatever scrap I can scrounge up\*; engine block, engine heads, exhaust manifolds. Temperatures will vary between -40 and 150. I may see up to 850 on my EGT, but that will be only related to exhaust stuff.

So, I have a bunch of questions related to this.

**Bolt/Stud grade**

I understand grade has to do with ""hardness"", however, I also read that higher isn't necessarily better depending the application. I would love to hear more about this.

**Material**

I'd like to use stainless where possible, if only to prevent rust and stuck fasteners. Anything that will prevent broken bolts is best, however, I don't know much, so I'm open to understanding.

**Thread**

Course, fine, how ""deep"" in the material it is, I don't know much about this. However, thread that will be harder to crossthread or less prone to damage is best. I also have to consider the torque specs.

**Stud/bolt size**

Is bigger always better?

Basically, I just want to understand more about bolt, studs and nuts. Anything useful goes!

This is explained by energy production being localised and having limited transfer capacity.

In the last few years a large high voltage DC power line was completed that was meant to alleviate this problem, however despite a huge imbalance in electricity prices this link runs at about half capacity. This has been explained by a need for safety margins in the grid, due to in sufficient predictable energy production in the south.

My question is how this affects the transfer capacity in concrete terms. Why do you need a lot of local production to safely import power? Is it because in this case the link is DC?

I did a post on [r/EngineeringStudents](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/) about whether I should choose ChemE or MechE, and someone commented about how I should look at what people from those majors regret. Now, it seems as if the majority of engineers in those posts hate their jobs and lives, working for a greedy corporation in a cubicle.

I love engineering though. Math, physics, and chemistry are exciting to me. I can't think of studying anything else. I will probably hate myself for saying this in a few years but vibrations sounds like such an awesome class. And my mom is always telling me about how someone has to do something about the climate crisis. I know politics, law, etc. are probably more effective but it would be my dream to make something that helps the environment in some way. So I decided to switch from chemical to mechanical engineering with a minor in CS, energy and/or environmental engineering. And I finally felt like I settled on the right major/minors for me.

But then I read about engineers who regretted their decisions. And then hearing about people in dead end jobs who lack passion about what they are doing. People who wish they went into software development for the money, or business for (supposedly) the ease of life. Even medicine for the direct applicability of their studies, instead of engineering where everything you learn supposedly is done by an excel spreadsheet. I am just terrified that I am going to become one of those people. Lured into this field because the classes interested me but ending up not doing anything meaningful for this world.

My dad (a doctor) keeps telling me that I am going to regret not doing medicine. I know it pays well and honestly the 8-10 years of school sound great (I would stay in school for the rest of my life if it paid me money). But I hate biology more than anything and I just love the concept of engineering. I'm so worried that he is right and that I will regret my decision.

I've also been thinking a lot about the past year. I felt such dread and regret in my college decision that it almost drove me to suicide one night. All I want is to do something meaningful, and I don't know if I could live with myself if I make the wrong decision. I could just be over thinking all of this but I have been incredibly blessed with the ability to choose what to do with my life and it stresses me out to no end. I just want to be able to make a decision and look forward, instead of bouncing back and forth between all of the fucking possibilities.

So now I just feel more stuck than ever and don't know what to do at all. Does anyone have any advice or experiences related to this? I will gladly read them tonight or after my 9am organic chemistry lecture, because I'm worried I will regret not taking that class even though everyone else says it's hell",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,282573,public,self,Am I going to regret majoring in engineering?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/x0dti6/am_i_going_to_regret_majoring_in_engineering/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,
