I need help on designing heat sink for an enclosure to help in dissipating heat of 130°F. The dimensions of the enclosure is 9.42"" x 6.40894"" x 2.165"" (LxWxH)
 
The specs for the two of the most heat generating component:
 
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/atom/c-series/c3000-family-brief.html 
 
https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/p-duke-technology-inc/RED60-24S48W/15295559 
 
 
I did use this [calculator](https://www.heatsinkcalculator.com/heat-sink-size-calculator.html) to model a heat sink to get started (despite what the note on the site says).
 
The specs for that design:
 
- Al 6061-T6
 
- 9.07709"" x 6.40894"" x 1.681""
 
- 29 fins with height of 1.451""
 
- thickness of base is 0.23""
 
- spacing between fins is 0.315""
 
- fin thickness is 0.1""
 
 
 
I am not sure if what I have made is good enough for what we need. Right now, without the heat sink, the top of the enclosure (where the heat sink would sit) is about 130-140°F and we would like to bring that temperature down to at least 120°F. As of now, there are no interal/external fans. Not asking to solve this for me, but how to go about solving or if I am on the right track or if there is something that I am missing.

I studied Industrial Engineering and Management and I have my masters, which I finished a year ago. 

I am currently working in risk consulting, and I really don’t like most of my projects. My current one is the only one out of 5 so far that I like: I am working as a Business Analyst/Product Manager for a new software, gathering requirements, writing User Stories, aligning with developers, etc. I actually really like this because I love to see my ideas implemented!

During my degree all of my favourite projects had to do with programming: a library application, a “Uber eats” app, a volunteering website, an optimization algorithm. My master thesis was also the development of an route optimization algorithm in C++ and implementing it in a company. 

I came to the conclusion that I like to build things… I know I want to switch jobs (just because even though I like my current project, 1/5 is a very bad ration ahah). Thinking if I should go to SWE and work as a developer? I am quite familiar with C++, Python, PHP and JS (though I don’t know modern frameworks like React or NodeJS or Django). Most of my knowledge is from 2-4 years ago and I need to get reminded of it all. Do you think this would be a good choice for me? How hard would it be to gain the knowledge required for a job in the area? 

I have also thought about other possibilities like Product Management, or Data Science/Data Analytics.. I feel like I don’t know anymore where I see myself.

I have a job offer in my home city that pays a little bit more, and aligns more closely with my long term goals and interests. This type of opportunity presented itself a lot sooner than I expected.

Right now I’m the defunct lead engineer after 2 engineers quit back to back at the beginning of the year. To fill one of those spots, we hired a fresh grad engineer at the beginning of the summer, and I am his mentor. One spot is still open, so he’d be on his own if I left.

I have 2 outstanding projects that will take place later this year. I’ve purchased like 90% of the services and materials; it’s just commissioning left. 

I feel like I’m letting my team down if I decide to accept the offer. My current company has given me a lot, and I know if I stayed forever I’d be set up very well based on my current trajectory. 

As I said I’m very intrigued by the type of work in the new role, and I have a desire to be back home after 6 years away including school. I’m just scared of what I’m giving up and scared to let people down. Am I overthinking this?

The goal is to install a 120VAC- 200Amp service panel. I could go lower on amps too.

My answer is that I would need a single phase 25KVA transformer (120V-208A, 240V-104A, 480V-52A ratings). Connect three #6 AWG THHN (75A rated) wires between the 50Amp breaker and the primary side of the 25KVA transformer, with an additional #6 AWG ground wire. Connect two #3/0 THHN (225A rated) wires between the secondary side of the transformer and the 200A service panel, with an additional #3/0 ground wire.

Piston type accumulators have a specific power of 100-300 kW/kg and compound accumulators are about 3 times lighter than steel accumulators:

So we can expect 300-900 kW/kg for this one, the first compound piston type accumulator:

[https://steelheadcomposites.com/piston-accumulators/](https://steelheadcomposites.com/piston-accumulators/)

But those accumulators use nitrogen, helium has the lowest atomic radius of all elements in the periodic table and it's found in it's atomic state (unlike hydrogen) so it can reach the highest number of moles per liter so the highest volumetric energy density and pressure.

[https://patents.google.com/patent/EP0215296A1/en](https://patents.google.com/patent/EP0215296A1/en)

We would need a stronger pressure vessel so specific power would not change but volumetric power density would increase (unless we use carbon nanotubes or something).

And what if we use hot helium? We could exceed 2'000 bar...

Or maybe should I ask them to make me an offer first? Benefits are better with the mid size firm. Only negative is that it would increase my commute by about fifteen minutes each way. 


According to my research, the average pay for my position in my area is roughly $92k - $105k.

My question is: what would be the main reason for that, would that be for a more linear, hence more controllable force output? Or is there something else that I'm missing?

Those solenoids I mentioned are custom made ones, from diverse manufacturers, the application consists of having a solenoid being PWM'ed through a range of different currents to achieve different forces, from very soft to hard strikes (usually overvoltaged).

For reference, I'm adding here a website from a manufacturer that do provide one of those ""silent"" solenoids, although I couldn't really find the schematics for it.

This is probably more appropriate for an engineer to make an in person visit and give an evaluation, but I figured it couldn't hurt inquire here first.  My house is waterfront, and our backyard slopes a bit down towards the water ([View 1](https://imgur.com/undefined), [View 2](https://imgur.com/undefined)).  We're getting a playground for our kids, and the yard needs to be level.  We actually had a landscaper dig out a section of the yard and level that specific spot, but now the wife thinks it's an eyesore and would just rather have the entire yard level.

So now we have another company that's going to be doing that.  They're going to add three railroad ties along the length of the bulkhead (about 18"" tall in total), and that'll match the high point of the yard, which is about where the concrete patio is in the images.  Then they'll bring in a bunch of topsoil to make the whole yard level with that.

However we were out on our kayak the other day, and my wife noticed that it looks like one of our neighbor's may have done something similar in the past, and their bulkhead is bowing out towards the water, which is a big deal.  Our pilings currently go to the top of the bulkhead, and she brought up the point that once the yard is raised, the new top of the bulkhead will be about 18"" above the pilings.  

So the big question:  Is the fact that our pilings will stop before the top of the yard going to cause significant weight to be unsupported, leading a condition where the bulkhead may begin to bow towards the water?

[Neighbor's House 1](https://imgur.com/xaB3cGi)  [Neighbor's House 2](https://imgur.com/vbDhctq) (the house in question is the one with the green kayak and small white boat).  The images don't do a good job of showing the outward flex towards the water, so just take my word it's there I guess.

I'm thinking the answer is ""no"" because:

1 - I'm guessing they'll bring in about 40-50 yards of topsoil.  In the overall weight of all the earth of our backyard, that isn't a huge change from what's currently there.

2 - In the second image of the neighbor's house, if you look at the house on the far right that's half in frame, their pilings are also significantly below the top of their bulkhead/yard, but their bulkhead is nice and perfectly flat.

3 - There are numerous houses in the neighborhood with badly worn down bulkheads with significant bowing, most of which have tall pilings that go well above their yard.  It's often just caused by old age and poor upkeep.

4 - I want it to be

My family will be sailing on a cruise to the South Caribbean in January/February 2023. We have two cabin location options (all of the standard balconies are sold out, only metal ""obstructed"" balconies are left) and would like to know if you can ELI5 some scientific basics of wind while sailing to us. 

The first cabin we were offered are front-facing Forward of the ship. We will be head-on on the Lido deck. The view is probably unmatched but if wind keeps us off the balcony it will be pretty much pointless. 

The second cabin is also Forward ship but off to the side behind the bow. Still the front of the ship but not head-on. Will that make a big difference? I'm leaning towards this cabin but this is also the main reason why I came here to ask. If the wind during sailing will be about the same despite being a bit off to the side and facing outward then we might as well go with the head-on and gamble on being able to soak in the view if weather permitted. 

Weather and sea conditions aside (we also know Forward cabins aren't for the easily sea sick) will there be a difference in wind on these balconies during transit? I'm not expecting ZERO wind but I would prefer that it didn't feel like we are sticking our head out of the car window while driving. 

TLDR; If we are worried about wind and want to enjoy our cruise cabin balcony, should we go with a front-facing head-on balcony up high on the Lido deck  or should we go with a lower deck balcony off to the side (behind the bow) but still forward on the ship?",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,280728,public,self,Can you help my family choose a cruise cabin?
