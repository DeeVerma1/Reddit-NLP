(A smaller percentage have been sexual predators, but that is another story.) One person told me they only hire people, for a big company, that they can drink with. That set my red flags off hella hard. Tonight at my temporary job, until I find something entry level in engineering, I consoled an older man who was having some sort of horrible life/career crisis due to drinking. He turned out to be an engineer. Almost all of my classmates had issues with substance abuse. It was a horrifically toxic environment though, so I can’t blame the students at all. The professors were *just* as addicted to alcohol. Something that became more apparent to me the longer the degree dragged on. I’ll drink sometimes, but I’m not getting black out drunk every weekend, or walking around reeking of booze during the day either.

How do I find work with healthy people who are happy and not miserable? I’m still traumatized by some of the stuff I went through in college admittedly. I’m desperate to get a ‘big boy’ job where I can challenge myself and learn something new everyday. However, the older I get the more I just want to be happy in life. I don’t want to be a miserable person surrounded by other miserable people anymore. I’m done. My temporary job isn’t fancy, but I work with such lovely, happy people every shift. It has changed my mindset enough that I hopefully attract more fulfilling opportunities in life. I have had more positive interactions here in three months than in any other job or class ever.

Unfortunately, we have an abusive atmosphere and we passive aggressively guilt people into working long hours for below market pay.  We have had tons of people leave (without hiring replacements), but upper management has expressed that they don’t see a need ti change anything.  Currently managers are working 90-100 hours a week and getting projects on time, so everything is fine in their eyes.

I am concerned about the turnover, so to reduce it I think I will need to gaslight employees.  I want to strike the balance between keeping them motivated to work 70-80 hours per week, but break their spirits and confidence just enough that they don’t believe life can be any different and leave.  We have had some success hiring people with visa’s in the balance, and threatening them with deportation if they slow down on work.  We’ve also instituted impossible deadlines and make people individually believe it is a “personal failing” if they can’t keep up in business hours.  Finally, we regularly hold meetings where we tell the staff how great the company is, so they feel like their concerns are a “them” problem.

I'm a new grad MecE that signed a job offer months before graduation at an aerospace startup. When I signed, the offer stated a three month probation in which I would only be paid $45k a year (CAD, so a lot less in USD). It then promised ""significant monetary gain"" following the probation. I was naive and signed it because my dream has always been to work in aerospace.

Fast forward a few months, my three month probation ended and I was offered $50k with barely any benefits, which is beyond abysmal in my area. The CEO also promised ""a portion of the shares"" when/if we make it big but that was never on paper. However, I feel as though in these past 3.5 months, I've learned a significant amount of real world engineering skills. As sketchy as it sounds, I led the structural design of a major project during my probation, working late nights and weekends to get it done. I want to put these skills on a resume and go somewhere that values me more, but I feel as though 3.5 months appears meaningless on a resume. How much longer should I force myself to stay here before I am able to put these skills on a resume and move on elsewhere?

Furthermore, I'm unsure if this is even enforceable or not, but the NDA I signed stated a noncompete clause which barred me from working in any other aerospace company for 10 years after I leave this company. Although I want to continue working in aerospace, this might be a problem.

In college I started out as a mechanical engineering student up until my junior year when I decided, maybe industrial engineering would be something I would enjoy more as a profession. So I made the switch even though it set me back 2 years and graduated with an ISE degree. 

After college I was able to get a job as a manufacturing engineer at a fortune 500 company that builds commercial packaged and split system hvac units. At first I really loved my job because after all my time in school, it was refreshing and satisfying to see things that had been designed by other engineered to actually be fabricated and assembled. 

It’s been a little over a year and a half since starting and now I’m not so sure I want to continue working in this kind of environment. Not sure if it’s just this plant in particular but the upper managements attitude is concerning and it’s discouraging me from wanting to climb the ladder in the manufacturing world in general. I also would really like to  work from home completely or at the very least a hybrid schedule. Coming into work everyday when my other engineer friends are hybrid sucks!

SO, I’ve been looking into ways to enter more design oriented engineering roles since those are often remote or hybrid jobs. Due to the degree I choose and my current work experience I figured the best way to increase my odds of getting a job like that is to decouple my FE and PE tests. I would first take my FE in ise since that would be the quickest way to pass the FE. Then, study my balls off to try and pass the MDM PE exam. I figured I’ve since I’ve had some exposure to mechanical school work this would be my best shot. 

I have searched all over google and can’t find anyone that’s talked about doing something like this so I have no idea if it’s a good idea or a stupid one. I have a friend that has done something similar except he took the civil construction PE test and is a project engineer. 

Just looking for some feedback on whether it’s worth trying to take the MDM PE and if it matters If I take the ise FE instead of the mechanical one. 

TLDR: guy who graduated as an ISE became a manufacturing engineer and now wants to try and pass the ise FE and then try and pass the mechanical MDM PE so that he can try and get a hybrid or wfh design job. Good idea or bad idea?

Not sure if this is suitable for the sub or not?

I work for an engineering company in South-West England that are headquartered in North-West Pennsylvania.

They want me to move over and join the R&amp;D team (I am the sole R&amp;D engineer in the UK subsidary) there and I am considering it as I am single with no property ownership and so nothing really tying me down. I have also travelled there a couple of times for business and they are a friendly bunch with a reasonable 8-4 work ethic. My questions:

* I am earning £40K currently but due to specific circumstances (product launch) I will be asking my employer for a substantial pay rise next year up to £50K+ how would this compare to an electronic engineer salary in NW Pennsylvania? What would be a good offer if moving to the USA was agreed?
* The USA is of course huge and salaries vary by county to county so the average salary you get on google is not really relevant. What is the average engineering salary in NW Pennsylvania?
* Is there anyone on here who has made a similar move and if so, do you have advice that you may think is useful?

My stipend is 20k but I have access to 30k worth of student loan and I work part-time on the weekends doing web development for close to 10k. And I only have 4h a week worth of student contact time as part of my scholarship. I love R&amp;D and it would be difficult to say no even without the PhD.

I'm worried because people I know with PhDs often aren't considered for roles because they are over qualified.

Should I be worried about opportunities in the future?

Domething I noticed is that alot of my classmates in school would complain about learning the theory and would prefer to learn only the application. The thing is, I LOVE learning the theory.

My problem is this. My company might pay for a masters degree for me and I'm not sure what to do. I could see if they would pay for a masters in applied physocs and try to transfer to a more research focused role in the company, but they might not see a business justification for it. They would almost certainly pay for a m.e. masters, which is definitely more marketable, but as I said before I would prefer physics to get closer to those cutting edge discoveries. The third option is I just say fuck it and go for a full on physics phd. I'd rather not do that since I would he missing out on like 7 years of decent wages.
