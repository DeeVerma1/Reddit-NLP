Before I got the job offer, I was accepted into my school’s master of aerospace engineering program a few months ago and I took it. It’s a professional masters program, so I would be able to work while getting my degree remotely. I then recently took job offer about two weeks ago. 

The issue is that a professor that I currently work for (who is also on the committee for said graduate program) heavily advised me to not take classes through this program because he believed that the educational quality was subpar and recommended other schools that have better programs that align with my career interests. I would still be able to work while doing the programs he recommended. This would mean that I would have to wait for another year in order to meet the application deadlines for the other schools. My parents on the other hand, want me to do the master’s program I’m currently about to start so I can get the degree sooner. They are also helping me pay for it.

My question now is, if I drop out of the program in the pursuit of another program later on, will this impact my relationship with the employer that I recently accepted an offer with? I’m worried that they expected me to finish my masters at some point during my employment and that factored into my hiring, but if I drop it that might look bad on me. There has been no tuition reimbursement on the company’s part, nor any written agreement saying that they will reimburse me for my graduate program has been filled or created. I still want to get my master’s, but the company nor myself can predict what I’ll want in a year’s time.

I have just recently bought a piece of land in southern France and me and a friend want to build a little permaculture farm. 

I want to build a pressure tank with renewable energy sources, I thought probably wind energie might be good, since it is very windy here and a lot of neighbours are having either wind turbines powering well pumps or generate electricity with them. 

Wouldn't it be possible to install a big wind turbine that somehow drives a motor, which then again generates pressure inside a tank? I would use the build up pressure to power an irrigation system, which would probably need around 4 or 5 bar. And would need to be able to keep the pressure up for several minutes.

There doesn't seem to be too much on the topic to find online, so I thought I would try my luck here on reddit. 

Am I completly dreaming with my idea, or is it something, someone can implement with a little bit of time and effort? 

I hope you're all having a great day!!

I have a hunch here, but I just want to confirm my suspicion. In the above example, if datum plane A were referenced in the lower segment on the callout, the smaller tolerance zone(s) of Ø0.2 would be constrained perpendicular to datum A. (That is, the pattern remains spaced 30x50, but could shift and rotate within the larger tolerance zones of Ø0.6.) 

And if it *also* included datum B, the zones would further be constrained parallel to datum B. Meaning the pattern would no longer be able to ""rotate"" and could only translate/shift within the larger tolerance zones.

But in the example shown above, with no datum reference in the bottom segment, there is no orientation control to datum A or B. Meaning the smaller zones can now tilt out of perpendicularity with datum A.

**My question is:**  In this case, as the smaller Ø0.2 zones can now tilt with respect to datum A, must all four of them in the pattern remain parallel to **one another**? Meaning, the entire pattern must theoretically tilt as one? I believe this is the case, because I think the bottom segment positional tolerance still controls the ""spacing""  of the pattern features relative to one another, and it doesn't make much sense if they can each be oriented differently from each other. But I just wanted to confirm.

It’s my first job out of college. I actually got hired a few months before I graduated and only started working recently. However, apparently I started smack in the middle of what my manager called an organization restructuring. As a result of this restructuring, I’ve been placed into a group that does not include my hiring manager, the guy that was excited to have me!

At the time I (possibly naively?) thought this was just a small hiccup and my new manager seems really nice, so it shouldn’t be a problem, right? My new manager reassured me early on that organization restructuring is a normal thing, and that this one was just slightly more significant than the previous ones. But as I’ve been talking to my coworkers, they’ve gradually started letting on that this is restructuring is blowing up the company. Engineers with 20+, 35+ even, years of experience are being laid off. Here and there, people with less than one year of experience have quietly told me they’ve been laid off. Entire labs have been completely erased from the company. No one knows ANYONE with my specific job title.

Now I’m getting nervous. I can tell my new manager has no idea what to do with me. My original hiring manager was the one who actually needed the role, after all. I have gotten zero specific work assigned by him aside from mandatory trainings. He also moved out of state and literally is never onsite anymore. People in my group are quietly hypothesizing he’ll quit.

All I do all day is comb through schematics, learn more about EE on YouTube, and shadow tons and tons of people at my work, as recommended by previous reddit threads I’ve read. But with all of the layoffs I’m getting really nervous. I’m worried my job will be eliminated because the project I’m technically on is actually in a phase way beyond what my job title would deal with.

I’ve gotten mixed responses from my coworkers on whether my job is safe. Some of the old timers think the company needs new young people, so surely my job is fine. But others have expressed that it was highly unusual my offer wasn’t rescinded (I am the only new grad hire I know in my whole building… and all I do all day is talk to people around the building). Some, perhaps not outright, but definitely implied, I should look at other job opportunities.

Recently, at 6 months in, I've become very concerned about the rate of my development. In this time I've only been able to actually design one thing, some buried pipes. I've put together a number of reports but senior engineers seem to not have time, or not care about providing me with feedback, so I have no idea how I could have improved these. I requested to switch teams (maybe there would be more work to get stuck into) a couple weeks back but it was not facilitated. I feel like I learn some things of course , but not much to show for half a year in the office.

I have an interview tomorrow for an alternative job in tunnelling/structures. I think a new position could only teach me more, but it would likely be at the sacrifice of the very flexible working arrangement I have now (they let me work from my partners abroad for a month).

I'm wondering what others opinions are on this matter? If I feel like I'm not developing, and not enjoying the work so much besides, is the right thing to do to search for a new position?",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,279605,public,self,Prioritise my development or flexible working and slow progress?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/w8ntui/prioritise_my_development_or_flexible_working_and/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,

While I do wish to leave my current position, I got an opportunity to design a DAQ and upgrade the test lab on the same day as the job offer from the HVAC firm.

Our question is, is this actually more efficient than using that steam to generate electricity and powering heat pumps? I know that heat pump based *heating* using electricity generated from a fuel can be more efficient than burning the fuel to heat directly, since heat pumps mainly transport heat as opposed to generating it from scratch.

In the past, I have only ever spec'd YS textures for *produced parts,* eg, what texture the plastic part has when it comes out of the mold.

I am not super picky about the texture I get- I'd like it to be smooth and consistent, but I certainly don't need to pick one of 5,000 YS textures- thing is, I *really* don't want the tool marks from the CNC making the mold. (I might be making this issue up, as I've never CNC'd an aluminum mold myself before, but I think it's a real concern.)

So I'm thinking about using a ""bead blast this surface"" note on the mold surface, and a flatness callout on the interface surfaces between the two mold halves. But I don't know how to be more specific than ""bead blast this surface.""

I’ve had two internship experience with design in solidworks, and lately I’ve started to have some product ideas that I could design that I believe could make me have a decent living if manufactured/advertised properly. 

I plan to take one of my ideas and work on it every week until graduation to at least have a working prototype by then, and eventually have a complete product with it.

How realistic is it for design  engineers to make a living by launching their own product by mostly working by themselves ? I want to know whether or not my plan is ridiculous or not.
