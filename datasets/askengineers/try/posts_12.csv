Boat diving is the best, but short of that we shore dive, which involves lugging your gear over a sandy beach and walking into the water and swimming to where you want to dive.

However, I will be visiting a place soon (and potentially staying permanently) where — despite the fact that the scuba diving itself will be incredible — most of the shoreline is very rocky and inaccessible. I'm not racing to get anything done, I'm just starting to germinate some solutions in my mind to solve this accessibility problem in the long term in order to open up new areas for diving and exploration with minimal impact on the surrounding environment.

The area I'll be traveling to is the NE side of Hawai'i (the Big Island). There have been lava flows along huge swathes of the SE coast in the past few years which are a no go since those areas won't necessarily be stable to build on, let alone the fact that I won't be able to get there, but there are still many nice rocky shores that are stable, especially as you go more north.

I'm trying to brainstorm ways to make safe entrances to the water, with permission from the landowners, whether by constructing a dock (in the extreme case) or some sort of pully/zipline system between two poles (one on land, one in the water).

The height difference from the surface of the water to the edge of the cliff can be upwards of 20 ft or just a few feet. The lateral distance will generally be at least 10 ft, but more often 20-30 ft because this side of the island has the strongest waves and thus any system that places me into the water will have to be far enough from the rocky shore to avoid injury. Also keep in mind that as a scuba diver I'll have about 40 lbs of equipment I'm lugging with me, though a pully system that lowered my gear into the water could alleviate that. However, this system would also require me to drill underwater to place a pole, which is not something I've done before but I suppose it's possible.

I'm hoping people might throw out some ideas that I could think about over the coming months as I'm there that might work as a viable solution for this problem. Also, if you're aware of any legal requirements I should know about in terms of constructing such a system here, please do share. For example, while its clear I have to get permission from the landowner to build on his or her cliffside, is there a similar thing to consider for underwater ""land"" owned by the state?

I am trying to control a proportional solenoid valve with a controller that outputs a PWM signal to produce an effective voltage. The controller itself has a fixed range of duty cycle it can produce with a 12v peak. Since I can't alter the range of duty cycle, I was thinking I could alter the peak amplitude of the PWM signal to reduce the average voltage of the signal into the solenoid.

My thought was can I just take the existing 12v PWM output, pass this to a mosfet, and have a source of adjustable voltage into the mosfet. Im thinking this would give me a adjustable peak PWM signal.

Any other ideas or thoughts? Max amperage on the line is 2.5 amps.

I can provide more detailed flow information if needed, but to keep it simple, I have a 2"" nominal bore pipe, with CO2 flowing down it at 1 kg/s, at a pressure of 10 bar.

I've now learned that there is a dividing tee junction about 1/3rd of the way along the long pipe run, and this branch has a 1"" nominal bore.

Both the main and branch lines lead to two separate outlets that are at the same pressure, and I need to determine the outlet flow rate is at the main branch.

So my question is - since the cross-sectional area of the branch pipe is 1/4 of the area of the main pipe, can I just assume that the flow rate into this branch is also a 1/4 of the flow rate in the main line upstream of the tee? My feeling is that this would be an over-estimate as the flow ""wants"" to carry on going straight down the main line and it isn't as simple as just assuming a linear relation between the flow rates and cross-sectional area ratios.

# A Little Background...

I play a game called Satisfactory, and that game has Hypertubes in it that you can build to get around (""Get the scientists working on the tube technology!"") - a classic sci fi mode of transport. But a Youtuber who specialises in playing games to their breaking point stumbled upon an interesting phenomenon with the Hypertubes (I don't know that he actually discovered this, but he certainly seemed to independently stumble across it [in this video](https://youtu.be/t2X3wlvoShg?t=1078) in any case). He discovered that if you stack the hypertube entrances in series, each new entrance accelerates you. So by putting a long line of short tubes together you basically make a human cannon that is a \*much\* faster way of getting around the map.This little quirk of the game mechanics has now become standard practice in moving around the world in Satisfactory. eg: [ImKibbitz](https://youtu.be/s8Ifny9hW4E?t=569), or any of these dozens of tutorials: [https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=hypertube+cannon+satisfactory](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hypertube+cannon+satisfactory)These Hypertube cannons work for transport in the game because you also have Jetpacks and Hoverpacks which you can use to slow your descent and softly land on the ground. I still don't have a jet pack in real life, so this is a bit of a flaw of reality, but we \*do\* have parachutes, and increasingly, drone technology, including [passenger drones](https://youtu.be/lw6HDgv4ekE?t=30). So that got me wondering.... could we make it work?

# The Variables: What Could Go Wrong?

In my mind this problem can be broken down into the following three key problems that need to be solved:

1. The Yeet
2. Transit
3. Sticking the Landing

And these elements each have a range of issues to be considered.**The Yeet**

* What is the best way to launch a human into the sky?
* How quickly can we accelerate a human?
* How far can that human travel after that acceleration? (what is the maximum range and height of &lt;insert your favourite&gt; theoretical (safe) human Yeeting system?)
* How much space do we need to achieve this acceleration?
* Is it energy efficient?

**Transit**

* Wind resistance is a bitch - I expect we're going to need a capsule of some sort as a bare minimum.
* Birds. Planes. Drones. Rain. Wind speeds. Hail. Other people flying the Yeet Express. How big a problem are each of these things likely to be? What can we do to control or address them and make this work?

**Sticking The Landing**

* The obvious: How do you slow down and land safely every time without fail?
* What redundancies and failsafes can we build into the system to guarantee its safety?

# Available Technology to Consider

**The Yeet**

* Obvious first options: [Human slingshot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_wkQBDDgvI), and [Human Trebuchet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo_oigyFlTA) \- IMO these are too small and as such too dangerous. There isn't enough time to accelerate safely, or sufficiently, and therefore not enough time in the air to safely deploy a parachute or course correct to a safe landing site etc.
* Something like the [RocketSled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_sled) to launch a capsule - Seems like a fuel-expensive way to launch someone, and likely much more dangerous because of the volatility of the fuels.
* [SpinLaunch](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/328992-this-startup-wants-to-throw-satellites-into-orbit-with-a-giant-centrifuge) is a startup aiming to launch satelites into space with a giant centrifuge launcher. What rotational speed can an average human comfortably withstand, and how far would that rotational force yeet an aerodynamic capsule? This seems likely to be the best solution IMO, but I don't have a good intuition for how far this system might be able to launch a human. I certainly don't expect it to reach orbit, but I am curious what the practical limits would be.

**Transit**

* [Ultralight aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultralight_aviation), [Ballistic missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile), [cruise missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_missile), planes, (even cars for that matter) all give us a wealth of knowledge and technology to help manage aerodynamics, increased distance glide opportunities, and course corrections.
* Air Traffic Control is likely to be relevant, but mostly I suspect this sort of thing will only be possible with clearly defined 'flight paths' that exclude all other traffic (obviously, a flight path like this transiting a country would be called the 'Yeet Belt'). Radar, object tracking, and AI monitoring of data in real time could also be useful for controling launches by predicting potential intercept paths.
* Weather monitoring technology. Headwinds, tailwinds, and crosswinds will introduce pretty large variances in distance travelled and trajectory, so they will have to be calculated in real time and factored into the launch. Presumably temperature, humidity, and other things like those will also be factors...

**Sticking The Landing**

* Parachutes are too complex and prone to failure. Though almost certainly should be included in any solution as the final backup failsafe.
* People have [safely landed in giant nets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPC_h9Vmlxw) and even [cardboard boxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hG44arJ00s), so structure based landing solutions are not completely silly options. I wonder if 'giant flexible [slippery dip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AXS_9DshKI)' isn't a good solution to this? I remember [Jeb Corliss](https://youtu.be/TWfph3iNC-k) considering an option like this when he was also trying to land a wingsuit freefall without a parachute (but can't find the video right now). The principle is straight forward enough - A large flexible catchment space/material which then funnels the object down into a tube that slowly brings the object to rest on the ground exactly like a slide does for children.
* **Drone Rotors**. As mentioned above, we already have technically feasible [Human Passenger Drones](https://youtu.be/lw6HDgv4ekE?t=30). We could build those rotors into the capsule completely recessed into the hull until the later stage of the transit, at which time the rotors pop out and rapidly spin up to control the trajectory and speed of decent. Unlike passenger drones this would only need a small (relatively speaking) amount of energy to rapidly spin up the rotors, and control the descent for a short period of time before it would be back in its storage tube recharging and undergoing maintenance checks before reaching the front of the queue where it would be flung back to where it came from. This seems like the most likely solution that will work.

# Putting It All Together

My current thinking is that we would build a network of 'Yeet and Catch"" stations that use centrifugal force to throw a capsule carrying one or two well strapped in and well supported human passengers to a receiving station. The capsule may deply small wings shortly after launch in order to glide further than otherwise possible and control its trajectory akin to cruise missiles. Upon approach to the receiving station one of the several independant drone-rotor arrays deploys from its recess and rapidly spins up to slow the speed of the capsule, control its descent, and slowly land on a docking station that lets the passengers out and carries the capsule around to the back of the queue of capsules being launched back to where they came from (recharging its batteries while it waits).I think we need the maths on how far one of these capsules could realistically travel, and how long it would take to arrive in order to figure out if there is any basis to this at all or not. Is this a viable alternative to high-speed rail? A better alternative to 1-3 hours flights?If it is feasible and makes sense at all, my hunch is that it will be significantly more energy efficient than passenger drones and planes. Maybe not trains, but I expect it would be significantly faster than them.  (My wife was laughing at me hysterically for about 30 minutes when I described all of this to her, so now we absolutely must figure out these issues, solve the problems and build the first working prototype. It's important.)

# TL;DR

Do we now have sufficiently advanced technology to safely throw and catch capsules with human passengers from one location to a second location within a large 'Yeet Network'?

* How far could we practically throw such a capsule using centrifugal force? (How fast can an average human be spun? How far could that reach? How long would it take? Would small retractable wings help extend that range?)

In the way back times, you would take gun bits and soak them in a mild solution of vinegar(?) or even just outside.  The idea was to get a thin coating of rust on them.  At that point, you would take the gun (well, parts really) and boil it in water for 30 minutes or so.  During that time the FeO3 (rust) would form FeO4 (black iron oxide).  Voila, your gun was blued.  Well, realistically you would have to repeat the process multiple times to get a properly finished gun, but that was the basic process.

I've been tinking with this process a bit and while it works, I lack the chemistry knowledge to understand why immersion and a bit of heat causes the FeO3 to turn to FeO4.  One thing is clear, however... You need an extra O.

With this in mind, I was curious:

1 - If anybody can explain the FeO3 to FeO4 reaction.

2 - Would the formation of FeO4 be enhanced if one was to bubble oxygen through the water before/during boiling (to have an O2 saturated solution).

My boyfriend is 33 and a Mechanical engineer with endless hobbies that span from electrical to chemical.

I find he is constantly explaining things to me, offering advice and guidance. He’s always trying to see and know what I’m learning. Sometimes I’ll be studying and he will find out what I’m learning, read the text book and then start explaining it to me. He says it’s just him learning but I find the approach incredibly annoying and a little bit insulting. 

I go to school online and do labs using my own equipment. He wants to ask about all my assignments and basically do my labs with me, ask me questions about every detail and explain to me everything he knows (and some things he doesn’t ) . I’ve made it clear  that I would like to do my coursework without his input but he pushes and snoops. Sometimes it’s funny. Sometimes I try to have patience and answer his questions and listen to his input, to get what useful knowlage I can. Other times I accept this for conversations sake ( we would naturally talk about our common interests after all). 

 He insists he just wants to learn, that the point is to get all the information and facts. ( I don’t really have a right to say what he can and cannot study after all). He thinks I shouldn’t take it personally and to just hear him out. That he enjoys doing things with me (even though it usually ends with me being angry and not handling it well.) I do believe he is like this with everyone male or female but I have no proof of this. 

Either way, is this misogynistic of him? Even if it’s not intentional I feel its misogynistic to disregard the historic and current reality of male and female dynamics in these fields, or in life. To not value my need for learning independently and to repeatedly “explain” things to me when I’ve asked him not to.

Other possibilities include Im actually a control freak who has anger issues and I can’t get a long with people on this level.

I know if you wind a spool around a drum, the torque the motor exerts on the winding lessens as the wire increases the overall radius of the drum. So.. using the same thinking process.

Thanks for your thoughts!

However, there is a very large gap between costumizing systems and industrial systems in what they do, cost, size, etc.
The current systems have small motors that combined with the software calculate how far to rotate a round item during printing. However the rotational motor rigs either sit too high and interfere with the engraving/printing armature OR they are a 3jaw chuck that only sits high enough for 3-5"" diameter objects. It seems like a fundamental math and knowledge of small motor problem to get the solution, and I've considered a reverse engineering or engineering firm but just am not sure for something like this.
Any advice? What type of company do you think would be best to do this?
