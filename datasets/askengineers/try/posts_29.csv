One of my friends is researching on industrial inspections. He asked my opinion but I got no idea, tbh.

I believe there are many cases but I don't know any of them. He said there are many cases in aviation, naturally. Do you know such cases?

And I thought I could ask my fellow engineers for help. For my thesis I was doing experiments on a small reverse osmosis system for desalination (meant for use on boats and similar places). This is a picture of a similar system but not the exact same: [https://tecnicomar.it/reverse-osmosis-watermakers/essential/?lang=en](https://tecnicomar.it/reverse-osmosis-watermakers/essential/?lang=en)

Anywas, I am nearly done with my thesis but the proffessor wants me to do one more thing. He wants me to figure out how to make the system:

1. quieter
2. smaller

The elements of the system are:

\- A 0,55 kW centrifugal pump for supply of fresh water,  
\- Pretreatment: 30 and 5 micron cartridge filters  
\- a 1,1 kW highpressure plunger pump for increasing the pressure to suitably above osmotic pressure  
\- 2 reverse osmosis membranes (61 mm (2,4'') in diameter and 356 mm (14"") in length)  
\- post treatment: A remineralisation and carbon filter  
\- an automatic membrane flush system with a carbon filter meant for cleaning the membranes

Other important information is that the pressure on the system can go up 70 bar and it can produce 1,7 m\^3/day of fresh water at 60 bar and a salinity of 36000 mg/l.

So back to the task. As I have said the system should be quieter and smaller. The sound pressure level at the above test conditions and at a distance of 1 m is 80 dB. I thought one of the options for decreasing the noise was replacing the high pressure pump with a less noisy one. The current pumps emits a SPL of 68 dB at 1 m distance and as I was searching for alternative pumps (diaphragm, gear...) none of them really go much lower than that. Other options would be adding some insulation or setting an enclosure.

In regards to size it was suggested to me to find smaller filters and membranes. The membranes are 14'' in length and I made a pretty thorough search online and they don't go far shorter than that (I found one 13'' long but I don't think that's really worthy of mention that much). I managed to find somewhat smaller cartridge filters but not carbon and the reminilasor... Another suggestion made by the proffesor was to remove the 30 micron cartridge filter and just keep the 5 micron one, and to remoce the carbon filter in post treatment. But that's about all I could figure out in that field.

I am open to your suggestions. I definitely don't expect a full solution to this, but any help would be greatly appreciated. I was just curious to see what I may have missed.

A bit of context; I'm 25 and after having made some questionable life decisions in my earlier days, I have ended up with a worthless degree in a worthless field working in a dead-end job. Having done some soul searching, I realise that I've long held a passion for Engineering. This was what I was always going to do up until I was about 15, and this is where those aforementioned bad decisions were made and I ended up doing something else.

I've been looking over the options available to me as to how I could pursue a career in Engineering (hopefully its not too late :P) and an Open University course seems like the most practical option for me at this stage of my life. The main question I have is how valuable might this degree be in helping land an entry level job within the field of engineering? I know that 'the field of engineering' is way too broad and I'm only using this phrasing as I haven't done enough research yet to conclusively say ""I'd like to specialise in X""; I do not have a complete picture as to which fields are totally over-saturated, which have the best prospects for career progression, or most importantly which field I get the most enjoyment from (though I would say mechanical engineering seems the most appealing to me based on my limited research/personal preferences)

I have absolutely no clue as to how Open University degrees are considered amongst employers at engineering firms. It might also be worth mentioning that if I were to undertake this course, I would also search for and undertake as much volunteer work as I could find/I am able to do as I am well aware of how valuable practical experience can be.

Any advice or anecdotal experience would be greatly appreciated as it feels like I'm attempting to climb a mountain without a map right now. If anyone knows of, or has any experience with an alternate route into a career in engineering (e.g. the armed forces, apprenticeships etc.), I have not ruled anything out at this stage and this would also be massively appreciated.

The company I'm at is a smaller part of a more global medical device company. This smaller company had no EE's before at this local site. But they have a lot of hardware in their products, which was designed by the parent company over in Europe. They had one firmware engineer who seems to be more of a systems engineer since he know's the product so well and is involved with all stages of product design. During the interview this firmware engineer (who is my boss now) pitched the job to me as if there would be a ton of hardware design and PCB design and I would be a perfect fit for the role (I'm more on the analog design side and not so much on digital/coding side of things if that matters at all). 

I am now on my second week with this company and really feel like I was cat-fished. All the newer design stuff I just found out is going to stay in Europe. They told me I would basically only be involved in testing the hardware at our local site after it's been fabricated/assembled and received at our local site in the US. The only tasks I have in my foreseeable future is small fixes with soldering and the previously mentioned testing. I'm really over it and want to be doing actual design work, which is what I primarily did at my last jobs. 

So I'm trying to figure if it's better to wait 6 months so it looks like I tried to stick out on my resume? Or should I just start to apply for stuff now and not list this job on my resume?  I also already posted my new job title on LinkedIn. Should I delete the LinkedIn section for this job if I continue to work at this job while looking for another job? Should I just man up and tell my boss I'm thinking of quitting? Or say something else to him?

I'm a mechanical engineering apprentice (completed my Bachelor in ME). Assembly design and GD&amp;T isn't well taught in universities in general (personal opinion). I have a brain f\*\*k about this problem. It seems to be too simple. This is a case seen everywhere in mechanical design. Despite that commonality, I have somme difficulty to turn my head around it. Here is the assembly :  
[Assembly image](https://ibb.co/LNLtwTH)

It is a simple situation :

* 2 disks are fixed togheter with screws arranged radially
* Everything is symetrical
* There is a central circular extrusion for one of the 2 parts, the other has a corresponding hole
* The hole and the circular extrusion are assembled by a locational clearance fit   
so the 2 parts are assembled with precision
* One of the part has clearance holes for the screws, the other has threaded holes. So this is a fixed fastener situation

My problem is that the central locational clearance fit has the possibility to complicate the assembly with the screws. If the fit is too tight and the holes are not well located, there is a possibility for the screws to not fit in the holes.

So, in that case, the venerable fixed fastener formula isn't the whole story. So in my head, there is multiple possibilities :

* Forget the central fit. Do the fixed fastener formula for the screws and that's it!
* Use one fastener and the central fit as a surrogate fastener (how to do that)
* Any other solutions?

Does thinking of the system of the world as evil make you evil because those are the rules that define your system? Doesn’t that make the eradication of evil possible? I seem to think consciousness and game/system theory are extremely correlated.

Edit: what role would this play in addiction, etc.


Wouldn’t this prove god as the inevitable existence of of a function within a closed system. Example: the function of expansion and contraction of energy and matter within our universe would be God. Just as the god function of capitalism  becomes money as it improves life experience (up to a certain point), since we survive the system better when we have more truths. Then the god-function of consciousness would be to experience as much as possible or something along those lines. I can’t prove this through math myself but I can try with logic, I hope this is the right crowd (systems engineers) Eventually, this would also prove morality as logical and the inexistence of a future.

I've spoken with my competitors, other parties and even the companies own employees and everyone gets the same treatment from this person.

The company has a team of about 10 others that do the same role (SCADA programming) and these issues simply don't exist with the other members.  The project timelines have SCADA related work done at the end, as everything else has to be up and running before SCADA can be commissioned.  This puts an intense amount of pressure on the people in the field at the worst possible time.

The SCADA programming job is a degreed Engineering position.  In my last report to my supervisor about these issues, I summarized it as ""she's not Engineering, she's guessing and guessing wrong every time.""

I noticed that no fuel is going towards the diesel injectors aka (since I am not an engineer nor is english my main language) the 3 thingies on top of the 3 cylinder heads of the tractor engine (by loosening the nuts that connect the pipe that goes from the distributor pump to the injectors and noticing that no fuel seems to go off of there)                                           


So with that scientific analysis I deduced that there is something wrong with the CAV distribution pump :P                                         


my unit is very similar if not identical to this one https://imgur.com/a/IvcVg5z                                       


I took apart one of the ""heads"" that lead to an injector pipe (point showcased with a green arrow in the picture) and try to start the engine and noticed that the cylinder inside which I could peak through that hole rotates (so I assume nothing ""broke"" inside the pump)                                              


Then I used the manual ""pump button"" on the tractor's filter and took off what I think is a ""relief screw"" (in the area of the blue circle on the outside of the pump) and from that screw I saw that diesel came out with reasonable force (it was shooting out a straight line for several cm)  and pushed that button several times                                    


So I assume the pump had some sort of problem holding the pressure it needs.                                        


What I did is taking off the ""inlet"" part (the outmost right part as you see the picture where fuel gets into the pump from the tractors filter ) 

And since I did that I also changed its small cylindrical filter the o ring the two parts that form a cross there and the small eccentric cylindrical piece that surrounds it (the parts I show in green arrows here https://imgur.com/a/gE3Qmpu )                    


What I noticed is that a small piston in the inside cylinder of the ""inlet"" part was stuck I used a plastic rod to push it and significant force to unstuck it , I didnt have a replacement for that so what I did is to soak it in diesel and then use a brush to clean it from the inside,  then used WD 40 and bruished it again. 

The result was that the small piston could move **somewhat** freely inside its cylinder but it still wasnt that easy at least not when it reached a particular point (there was no apparent damage on the piston or the cyliner at least not something big enough my eyes could see) 

The piston I am talking about is the part labeled as ""16"" here https://imgur.com/a/I6ek5Yb

Since I couldnt do anything more than this I installed that ""inlet part"" and the tractor still couldnt start (while again checking that diesel was going to the pump and taking again that screw off and saw that a stream of diesel was going out with reasonable force every time I was pushing the filter button, and obviously I srew that screw back in tightly before trying to start the tractor again. 


As far as I understand (referencing this picture https://imgur.com/a/Bi46leO) the fuel goes from the small plastic filter to the pump from the ""upside"" 1 and as the pump rotates the fuels should go to the diesel injector when its at 2, and if the pressure is too high then from 2 on the ""inlet part"" side it should push the aforementioned piston up and that in turn should lead that fuel to the upper part of the ""inlet part"" (1) 

Right?

2) How can I learn quickly, especially when I don't have a foundation of knowledge that more senior people do? 

For example, I'm doing a project on telecoms, but my RF/antenna knowledge, my signal processing knowledge, my encryption knowledge, my signal modulation knowledge is all puddle deep. Where to even begin?

The reason I ask is because we have a rotary atomizer which uses open bearings and oil flows through them. There's a vacuum pump that allows oil slowly pass through without letting it leak. I believe it works by sucking oil through the bearing at a slow rate to prevent oil from ever being able to leak out. This is used in a spray dry application where food is manufactured so it's important to not let the oil leak into the product.

However, is there an option with a fully enclosed bearing with ports on the outer race, or probably better to have them on the ""sealed"" face to allow oil to run through it and keep it within temp while spinning at 20k RPM.

I am trying to find images or drawings of how mansion houses were powered in the 1800s and early 1900s (pre 1920) and hoping someone can source it for me, as despite me searching cannot find anything, maybe I am using wrong keywords but maybe someone else can have luck.

Basically the place I am trying to research has a mansion house in rural scotland and half a mile away from that was a building called ""Battery Shed"" and ""Engine Shed"", the engine shed had some sort of engine/fly wheel/dynamo on a large concrete block and next door was a place that has the battery cells and accumulator.

It is presumed the engine powered the battery cells and the power from them was fed to the mansion house to supply the 110v power supply.

As to what kind of generator/engine was used that is the big unknown question, but I did see that Cragside has a very similar looking Power House building and the generator/cells could be similar. But unlike cragside the mansion house i am investigating does not have a hydropower setup

There was however a private water supply fed to the house from a large circular water tank on side of hill (another half mile away from that engine building) so there is a possibility that may have been used to power the generator/engine but as to how that could have been done is unknown. (the location of mansion house was not near a river or running water, so conventional power wheel would not be used)

it is a large round tank, 7 Meters in height, 6 meters water height, 14 meters in diameter, [https://imgur.com/a/s5xUth6](https://imgur.com/a/s5xUth6) going by the size of the tank it would seem a bit excessive for just water to the mansion house, thats why i am thinking it may have had something to do with the generator, but how that would have been done is a mystery that I am trying to find out.

If it was not water how could this engine/generator have been powered, obviously coal is an option but nothing suggests that may have been used, and the same with has nothing suggests a facility or gasometer on site.

Water was fed into the tank from nearby hills and water fed to mansion house and associated buildings by quite large cast iron pipes so certainly the tank was used more than just for mansion house toilet and sink supply.

So taking everything into account the round water tank seems to be the key object of use.

So has anyone seen anything like this setup in images/drawings/plans? either engine/generator and/or batteries?

This is layout plan of the building in question

[https://imgur.com/AWCbp99](https://imgur.com/AWCbp99)

Power may not have been got from the power grid until early 1940s so taking that into account then batteries/generator may have powered house but its the how would generator have been powered that is baffling me.

To have a power house and battery cells obviously was important. I just cannot figure out how it was powered and this is why I need some other input from others as they may know something i would not know.

1, flat roof

2. battery house/shed

3. engine house/shed

4. open area full length and height but no access to both sheds except hole in wall size of large fist where flywheel pole passed through
