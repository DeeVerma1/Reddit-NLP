I completely understand that taking a course that helps lean out a manufacturing process is obviously going to be beneficial to my career as an engineer.

I am unsure if becoming ""Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Certified"" will be better than simply stating that I have experience ""using the DMAIC methodology to lean out a manufacturing process.""

I also understand that this should be something I should just google; however, the more I look into Lean Six Sigma, the more suspicious I become.

For one, the ""Lean Six Sigma Organization Structure"" is [literally a pyramid.](https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/AW-eVRPM1wqsFkqx1Bo6_mMgd1c=/800x600/filters:fill(auto,1)/Lean_Six_Sigma_Structure_Pyramid-671e13ecc9e84e6e922d961234f57124.png) This concerns me because the class I'm considering taking is for a ""Green Belt Certification."" It is taught by 2 people who are ""Black Belt and Master Black Belt"" certified (Also suspicious leadership role titles)

Secondly, and most importantly, it seems online the only people who are recommending getting certified are those whom are already certified, usually individuals trying to sell their class onto others which I would assume would help them get their double black belt certification.

Lastly, The more I read into LSS, the more it sounds like [The Dragons Den Pyramid Scheme Pitch on Shark Tank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZH_HaqZ-8s). Down to the silly naming scheme.

Does the Lean Six Sigma Certification matter to job recruiters who don't know about it?

Is a Lean Six Sigma Certification something a lot of engineers actually know and recognize?

Should I just take the course and get properly certified?

I have a mortgage, and $30K left in student loans to pay off from my bachelor's degree in CRJ. I have jobs with an armored truck company and with a short line railroad, pulling in about $60K annual working between 50-60 hours every week. My wife is a radiography tech making about $70K at 40 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be worth while for me to go back to school at the county college, and pursue an associates in either mechanical or electrical engineering? Realistically, what sort of job outlook is there for a two year degree in that field, of any? I've seen it suggested that the position of engineering technician can be hired with an associates, but I am skeptical about how realistic this is. If anymore is it knows an engineering tech, your input would be greatly valued. Also, I estimate an associates would cost me about $5K given the credits I already have with the county college, so I would need no additional loans for that.

&amp;#x200B;

However if an associates degree is not enough, then the situation is very different. It means I would have to return to Rutgers and accrue another $35K in debt, something that is not ideal at all when there is already a mortgage and possible children in the mix, especially when there is still no guarantee of a lucrative career afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

So finally given the circumstances, is this a good call? Should I pursue the associates, and maybe hope for a job that will provide tuition assistance to obtain further engineering education? Or should I play it safe in the grind that I already live? My other option is to find a job with a passenger rail line, which can be as lucrative as an engineer and I already have a background in, though I've already sunk two years into trying this angle, and have come up empty handed, even when it appeared I was guaranteed a position with one due to my connections and experience.

So here I am posting for the first time, looking for some career advice.

I'm a 26 year old living in Vancouver, working as a project manager at a local municipality. I studied geological engineering in my undergrad, then worked in geotechnical consulting for a few years, and am now back in school part time getting my masters in civil engineering (project management focused).

I feel that as engineers, we have a duty to help humanity endure what I believe to be our biggest threat - climate change. I have made it a goal of my career to have a positive impact on this challenge. With a geo/civil eng (and now project management) background, I feel that I have some useful tools to help me achieve this goal. Even at my current job as a project manager, I try to find ways to make my projects more sustainable, and am working on projects related to climate change adaption (mostly flood risk). But I can't help but feel that I could have a bigger impact. I'm just not entirely sure what that looks like.

And so I come to you, reddit, for any advice or ideas you people may have on ways I can guide my career to achieve my goal.

Here a sub-sonic .22lr fires a 42 grain bullet at around 1065 FPS with about 105 ft/lbs of energy. And requires a licence.

**BUT** 

A crossbow firing a 300 grain bolt at 300FPS at around 60 ft/lbs is perfectly legal.

Would it be within the laws of physics to devise a method by which the crossbow is able to launch a pellet at a greater energy than the legal air rifle yet retain the accuracy of one by use of a barrel?

I'm aware there are crossbows with sub MOA capability at 100 yards that can be purchased I am just curious as to feasibility of such an endeavour.

I want to find current options for really beefing up exterior insulation on residential - talking bring a r-12 to passive house r-50 or r-60 levels.

I think this approach has to be part of the whole net zero approach, but costs just seem very high. I dont expect good work to be cheap, but I work in energy efficiency and as soon as the price tag is seen, this become something impossible for most people, and impractical for the rest.

I'm aware of EIFS, Larson trusses, double frame, I've seen fiberglass s shaped channels. I'm not familiar enough with he siding installation requirements, but would having more spacing or a different type cladding system be possible?

One idea I floated in my head was literal giant 4 feet width and house perimeter width sheets of insulation fabric you'd just walk around then house with a corner support system so it still is wide. But I know you want  cladding to cover it and ideally have a good water shedding, air gap, air/weather barrier to protect that insulation - so just using cables from corner to corner would probably be too flexible.

Any insights from those actively working on cladding products or installation of such would be really appreciated to get a better idea of what the options - or even resources to understand the limitations and current design requirements would be great.

So I’m a current civil engineering student and I was hoping if a few of my questions could be answered about future career options or grad options.

1) Can I work on getting a PE after undergrad? 

2) How does a masters or a phd program help me besides a higher paid job?

3) Will doing my masters or phd make getting a PE easier?

4) What’s better private or public sectors?

I have been enrolled in both classes but I only need one of the two. I am enrolled in NDE of Aero Structures if that may be relevant since part of my decision is based on which class may go better with it. These other two topics I have very little knowledge on as well the difficulty and usefulness they present.

The first class is Guidance and Navigation Control. This class has 5 or 6 projects throughout the semester and no exams or homework. This is very appealing since I learn better hands on and don't do as well on exams. However, this class requires some level of proficiency in MATLAB, which I have never learned. I have very little coding experience so I am not sure how doable this class will be while learning this program. One of my questions was how difficult this program was to learn. I would really love to gain experience in MATLAB, though. Others who have taken this class said that they have had some experience with other programming languages, but none in MATLAB, and were able to complete his projects, which I've heard can be very complex. He does say, however, that he will be providing some sample codes, but I was unsure if that will be enough or not depending on how hard this program was to learn.

The second class is Radiation Heat Transfer. I had a fairly easy time in Intermediate Heat Transfer, where we went in-depth on the three kinds of heat transfer. The idea of this subject does really interest me, however, this professor is not very highly regarded, unlike the GNE professor who is very well respected. My worry taking this class is the quality of class that this will be since before I took a class with a professor who wasn't as respected, but on tenure, who almost got fired from the dean of the school because of misinformation and tangents that kept happening in the class.

To fuel it, I purchased an ""HHO"" electrolysis machine that splits water to produce a mix of hydrogen and oxygen (oxyhydrogen). However, this mixture detonates rather than burning, and I am concerned about the effects of a potentially large detonation on my launcher. I am trying to find ways to slow down the combustion or otherwise prevent detonation. The ideas I have so far are:

* Mix oxyhydrogen with excess air to be leaner (out of detonation limit)
* Mix oxyhydrogen with other fuel to be richer (out of detonation limit)
* Mix oxyhydrogen with inert gas (nitrogen)
* Mix oxyhydrogen with substance to slow down burn (water vapor/mist)
    * For all of these mixing processes will the gasses stay mixed?
* Allow oxyhydrogen to separate by density and tap hydrogen off individually
    * Still need to worry about mixing with air, detonation limit 18 - 59%
* pack combustion chamber with steel wool, mesh, or thin tubes
    * breaks up gas pockets, pulls away energy to slow down burn
    * like a mining safety lantern
* Make gas into a foam
    * Bubbles burn one at a time, not one big detonation
    * I found when burning soap bubbles, a single large bubble made a bigger bang than many smaller bubbles of comparable volume
    * A solid/semi-stable foam could also make metering easier
* Oxidize something to strip away oxygen from oxyhydrogen mix
    * Flow through iron powder?
* Use pure hydrogen (purchased) instead of oxyhydrogen
    * This is supposed to be a promo for a larger ""green hydrogen"" electrolysis setup, so would prefer to use the electrolyzer I have

 Another topic could be a detailed look at pumps role in the system, and how it interacts with the control valves and overcomes pressure drops etc.
