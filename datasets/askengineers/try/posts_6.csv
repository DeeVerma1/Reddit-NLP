Hi, everyone.
As the title suggests, I'm currently in the Army, and I'll be transitioning to the civilian world in a few months.

I (27M), spent about 2 years as a Sergeant, and I don't have much technical skills as I'm an infantryman (combat oriented job). One of the degree programs that piqued my interest is an engineering management degree at a school in the northeast. Ideally, I'd like to major in industrial engineering, but that's the closest that I can get to in the area that I will be moving to (non-negotiable).

I've always had a quantitative mind, loved statistics as a kid, and have always been interested in making things and how to do things in the most efficient way possible.
Also, during my time in the Army, I've earned a Data+ cert from CompTIA, and I'm somewhat familiar with SQL.

However, I have a bit have a dilemma. I've always been told that any engineering program without Calc III and thermodynamics as a requirement is a bullshit degree. The degree in engineering management only requires Calc I, and gen physics II. That being said, the curriculum is mostly heavy in statistics, creating efficiency, operational management, and some traditional business courses like managerial accounting and finance. 

I'd love to study in the program, but I'm a bit worried about its job prospects. Although I have some supervisory experience in the Army, and am planning on getting my project management cert, I feel intimidated by the idea of managing a team of engineers as someone without a hard engineering degree or experience. Am I right to feel this way about it? The program is from a reputable school that focuses on STEM, and I've heard great things from the program, but I feel like my degree won't be useful in the real world.

I have a shell and tube HX, used for temperature control. Shell-side is steam, tube side is water, the proportion of water flowing through the HX is temperature regulated and is used to temper the water. The system works great, but it is large, difficult to replace due to its location, and expensive.

What if instead it were replaced with a mixing tee, with steam as the primary (nozzle) inlet and water as the secondary inlet? A TCV could be used to control steam pressure. Alternatively, the steam pressure could be static and the same system as before could be used to control the % cooling water flowing through the tee.

Possible issue's I've heard are (1) lime will build up on the nozzle, making it less effective over time, (2) the system is pressure sensitive and cannot easily be tuned, so temperature control will degrade with corrosion/fouling, and (3) if the nozzle breaks, or is not designed correctly, it can cause some serious resonance (shaking) in the pipes.

And yet of course unlike clean water and stable power, the truth or reliability of information can be extremely difficult to ascribe a value.

And when the majority of our access and understanding of the world is channeled through our phones through the internet and filtered by social media apps, I worry we are all flooding ourselves with junk information and losing track of reality.

**Q: So I wanted to ask, how would you think about the disinformation problem in America as an engineering problem?**

*Let's take a an example problem: reporting the outcome of an election.*

In America, you have organizations like the Associated Press that have investigated and reportd on elections and their outcomes for over a hundred years.

So when the AP calls elections, you can have high confidence it is the correct call because of the hours of work put in to chasing down sources and information and good reporting.

But on the internet, anyone can create websites claiming whatever they, and high quality information like what's reported on AP gets laundered with disinformation and conspiracies.

Your news says Candidate A won the election, my news site says the election was ""rigged"" and Candidate B is the real winner.

One website says the world is one way, another website says the complete opposite. And we as individuals are supposed to grasp around in the dark and cling to whatever ""feels"" real to us.

But what about the people who just want the ordinary truth, no bells and whistles?

The internet can be like a window to the rest of the world - a way to connect one another in our shared humanity.

Or it can be used to spread lies and conspiracies and groom people to manipulate their behavior and perceptions of politics to win elections.

But when I look up information like the outcome of an election or the headlines, I don't want someone's opinion on it - I want the best most reliable information possible.

And that means having a system that defends reliable sources and keeps out unreliable manipulative disinformation machines.

And we need to think about the user experience - an ordinary person living their life scrolling on their phone. If someone wants news on a certain topic, how do we help them get access without just saying ""read everything and decide for yourself what feels real?""

Thoughts?

How could we create a system that separates and sorts between reliable sources - and the infinite junk information and malicious disinformation on the internet?

So a little backstory about me, I'm currently a manufacturing engineer with a company that makes tank transmissions. Its not the field I really wanted to go in but its what I had to take.  I don't necessarily hate the industry as its still problem solving but the work is just boring and actually makes me sad bc I feel now stuck in a world I don't enjoy.

 I started off my journey in college as a mechanical engineer but halfway through knew it wasn't for me. (I'm a huge car guy so I thought working in automotive would be a dream but now know its a hobby). I wanted to be more office based and work in software/management. So I switched majors into Engineering Management. I thought based on the curriculum I would be able to have a broad range of jobs and work in many fields, however my school almost made it so I worked in manufacturing mainly (until this year which they now added a couple of coding courses...…figures)

 I want to go into software as I love the tech industry and love tedious work at the computer. Its something that really interests me. I've actually known this since my senior year of college but couldn't find a way to transition and like I said had no choice but to get some experience and money under my belt. I do know some coding but only the bare bones and don't really have a language I'm comfortable with, unless you call MATLAB a language lol.

I feel very fortunate to be in the position I am but want to get out into tech and software. My big plan and end goal is to get into engineering management in software. So I need to learn code. I know that if I do It will go with my Degree really well and current skill set. I feel like its an easy transition if I learn code but not 100%

So the question is, for my scenario, where do I even begin. For anyone who has made the switch what tips do you have?

In other areas the gas line is simply sized with a 2 or a 4 or a 1. The water piping as well has these strange letters. There are also i's around; and I don't know if there's a difference between ""1s"" and just ""s"".

Is this some sizing standard that I'm unfamiliar with? I haven't found any note or legend or other explanation whatsoever in the drawings.

Other engineers who are at the same level as me or even less are paid more than me. I have asked for a pay rise a few times over the past 3 years, and the director just laughs in my face.

I was told by HR that I am not allowed to raise a report about it as it will cause a lot of ‘animosity’ with the directors and it will make them want to ‘pay me less’.

My team is working to solve the problem of locating underground pipes. 

Currently we are looking into a system of attaching radio transceivers to pipes before burying them. Then, when we need to check for underground pipes in the future, we don't need to dig and expose them, we can instead detect them using an above ground radio transmitter. 

The problem is we are not sure if the radio signals can penetrate the 1m deep soil.

And a different SQE was like ""no that's not proof that it's supplier caused, they [testers] should be disassembling things"" which is where I saw red. One, because it took all of 5 minutes to grab a screwdriver and rule out assembly caused, and two, assemblers and testers are not staffed for that, they're not free labor for other departments to use, I have literally built a work instruction database that is searchable that is available to everyone for the purpose of verifying assy vs work instruction, and assy part numbers, since SQE seems to freak out when I give them an assembly, etc etc. And I raised my voice and said ""they are under takt, they are supposed to be hitting a step in the process every [x] minutes, they cannot disassemble things for us, AND meet delivery targets, investigations are our job, we should be doing them"".

But there's a bigger problem with me being the person who is constantly asked where things are, and, idk if this is just a condition of being in manufacturing but it is tiring.

I'll get asked where software files are stored for boards that *we don't even program at our site* because they're done at the supplier. I get asked where the manufacturing flow plans are. I get asked what procedure is impacted by a design change, when development has the exact same ability as I do to search for a part number and find it referenced in a work instruction. I get asked by regulatory where we have PDF scans of the labels we use! Like, I get that as mfg I am the process owner (although we don't own the pFMEA, can't remember why), but like, my fucking god. Why am I being treated like I'm Google?

I recently received my PhD in climate science but as a postdoc I have found that I am not too excited by a future in academia. While I am looking at private sector jobs that might be a good fit for my degree, I have discovered a deep interest in several engineering specialties. I have little interest in being a software engineer developing apps or websites, but I am drawn to implementing software ( also electronics at a high level) for systems that interact with the physical world. I am obviously drawn to the general field of 'robotics'. I am under no illusion that it would be easy to switch to a field like that, or that I would be competitive currently in that job market.  

That being said, do the folks here have some recommendations for pivoting to the types engineering jobs that I am interested in? A few career engineers in my family have recommended looking for systems engineering jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

My current plan is centered around:

1. learning / reviewing much of the fundamental math and science used in a field like 'robotics'. 

2. Produce and document personal projects that could be used to demonstrate some proficiency with at least the basics.

3. Clean up my Github and implement the algorithms from ""Introduction to Algorithms"" in C++.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR; I have a PhD in climate science, considering a pivot to engineering**

I had a discussion recently with an engineer at a fire hose manufacturer, and he said a couple of interesting things that I would love to actually understand.

First, he said ""it is dangerous to flow 300 gpm from a 2 inch hose."" Now, I understand that the pump discharge pressures become quite high to overcome the friction loss at that kind of velocity, but they're well within the burst pressure of the hose and the capability of the pump. I also empirically know that the hose does become quite unstable once you exceed a certain velocity. That critical velocity seems to be proportional to the diameter of the hose (or maybe more accurately, the circumference vs cross sectional area). Wall pressures seem to become highly unstable as you cross some threshold, but what is that limit? 

Second, he said that a 1.75"" inside diameter hose is ""hydraulically imbalanced"" at 50 psi nozzle pressure, which is why small hand line nozzles tend to be 75 or 100 psi, but a 2.5"" ID hose can tolerate a 50 psi nozzle without becoming unstable. How is residual pressure correlated to hose diameter to achieve a hydraulic balance? Again, empirically he is correct. If you want to use a 50 psi nozzle on a 1.5"" ID hose, you'll need to find a hose with higher than typical rigidity, or that nozzle will want to whip back into your face. It's especially evident in the last 10 feet or so before the nozzle. That's not such a problem with a 2.5"" hose. What's going on there?

I have two (or more) devices connected wirelessly. If I know relative orientation (and they're both still), can I use a magnetometer on one to infer the position of the other device, if the other device powers up 2+ inductors (one at a time, and with a background reading) to generate EM fields?

PLEASE NOTE: For technical reasons beyond the scope of this post I'm avoiding using Bluetooth to directly infer position. I can use BT to transfer data, but don't want to use BT RSSI methods for positioning.

**WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO**

I'm trying to make two devices (about 1-3"" cube max) be able to tell where they are relative to each other. Finding relative motion or orientation is doable, but I'm struggling with actual POSITION.

The devices are IMU sensors to record relative motion over time - imagine one on each hand, and being able to tell if you're making a ""turning a steering wheel"" motion.

The POSITION doesn't need to be tracked over time - so long as one device is the known ""origin"", the other sensor(s) just need to know where they are, relative to the origin, at the start of ""recording"".

This is turning out to be really tough! They need to be wireless, range is at MOST 3 meters but usually &lt;1m. Accuracy to about 10cm would be workable, but ofc better is great.

**CURRENT IDEA OF DOING IT?**

I'm thinking of placing a few inductors in each device, presumably 2-3. If you imagine each device is a cube, one in the bottom-left-front corner, and one in the top-right-rear corner (and maybe one in the center, theoretically optional).

If wireless comms are established (bluetooth, RF, maybe ESP-NOW) they can communicate commands to each other. If the ""origin"" device listens to the other (""remote""), could I do something like:

1. ""origin"" uses its magnetometer reads background EMF to get a baseline data input
2. ""origin"" asks ""remote"" to turn on TOP inductor, just generate an EM field
3. ""origin"" reads EMF again, using that input to detect the position of ""remote"" in space (since I know exactly how much voltage/current the inductor is getting, and microteslas it's producing. I can also take local measurements on ""remote"" to tell ""origin"" what value it SHOULD be reading if the device were right there. This recording will presumably be taken over a few hundred ms to gather and normalize a lot of samples)
4. with that reading, ""origin"" tells ""remote"" to turn off the TOP inductor, waits a moment, then tells it turn on the BOTTOM inductor
5. repeat step 3, reading the distance to BOTTOM inductor
6. ...profit?

In theory, now that I know the:

* Absolute orientation of both devices
* Inferred distance to each inductor (with background EMF compensated for)

That should be enough for me to \[Math\] and figure out exactly where in physical space the sensors are relative to origin.... right?

(Edit note: this can all be determined during a calibration period which is fine to take several seconds, and all devices will be completely still during that time.)
