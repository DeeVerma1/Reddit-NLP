Most of the references and training material I've looked up notes a pretty basic relationship between number of teeth for the sun, planet, and ring gears in a traditional planetary gear setup, as follows:

R = 2P + S

That is, the number of teeth on the ring gear is equal to twice the number of teeth on a single planet plus the number of teeth on the sun. Makes sense, especially if you envision the number of teeth as diameters and the gears as circles without teeth. 

However, I have looked at two different gearsets being used in products at my company - products in productions for a longtime with no issues or problems, and each of them uses a planetary gear setup that breaks this rule slightly.

System 1 has P = 20 and S = 8, so by the equation, the ring gear should be R = 48. However the ring gear has 49 teeth, one extra tooth. System 2 has P = 26 and S = 12. Again, this means R should = 64, but the ring gear actually has 66 teeth - *two* extra teeth.

I (think) these additional teeth were added to ensure/allow equidistant angular spacing of the planet gears (each system has three planets). This is achieved by ensuring that the sum of teeth on the ring plus the sun is evenly divisible by the number of planets (e.g. 49 + 8 = 57, which is evenly divisible by 3). 

But how/why is it ""acceptable/okay"" the the first rule of R = 2P + S is ""broken""? I haven't been able to find any literature that describes scenarios where this rule is broken, or outlining by how many teeth it is allowed to shift, or detailing the potential defects/drawbacks of designing this way. And if you think of this scenario with diameters and circles, it doesn't ""work"" because the sun/planets/ring can't all be tangent at the same time. So what gives?

Does anybody have any experience with designs like this?

I have two (or more) devices connected wirelessly. If I know relative orientation (and they're both still), can I use a magnetometer on one to infer the position of the other device, if the other device powers up 2+ inductors (one at a time, and with a background reading) to generate EM fields?

PLEASE NOTE: For technical reasons beyond the scope of this post I'm avoiding using Bluetooth to directly infer position. I can use BT to transfer data, but don't want to use BT RSSI methods for positioning.

**WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO**

I'm trying to make two devices (about 1-3"" cube max) be able to tell where they are relative to each other. Finding relative motion or orientation is doable, but I'm struggling with actual POSITION.

The devices are IMU sensors to record relative motion over time - imagine one on each hand, and being able to tell if you're making a ""turning a steering wheel"" motion.

The POSITION doesn't need to be tracked over time - so long as one device is the known ""origin"", the other sensor(s) just need to know where they are, relative to the origin, at the start of ""recording"".

This is turning out to be really tough! They need to be wireless, range is at MOST 3 meters but usually &lt;1m. Accuracy to about 10cm would be workable, but ofc better is great.

**CURRENT IDEA OF DOING IT?**

I'm thinking of placing a few inductors in each device, presumably 2-3. If you imagine each device is a cube, one in the bottom-left-front corner, and one in the top-right-rear corner (and maybe one in the center, theoretically optional).

If wireless comms are established (bluetooth, RF, maybe ESP-NOW) they can communicate commands to each other. If the ""origin"" device listens to the other (""remote""), could I do something like:

1. ""origin"" uses its magnetometer reads background EMF to get a baseline data input
2. ""origin"" asks ""remote"" to turn on TOP inductor, just generate an EM field
3. ""origin"" reads EMF again, using that input to detect the position of ""remote"" in space (since I know exactly how much voltage/current the inductor is getting, and microteslas it's producing. I can also take local measurements on ""remote"" to tell ""origin"" what value it SHOULD be reading if the device were right there. This recording will presumably be taken over a few hundred ms to gather and normalize a lot of samples)
4. with that reading, ""origin"" tells ""remote"" to turn off the TOP inductor, waits a moment, then tells it turn on the BOTTOM inductor
5. repeat step 3, reading the distance to BOTTOM inductor
6. ...profit?

In theory, now that I know the:

* Absolute orientation of both devices
* Inferred distance to each inductor (with background EMF compensated for)

That should be enough for me to \[Math\] and figure out exactly where in physical space the sensors are relative to origin.... right?

(Edit note: this can all be determined during a calibration period which is fine to take several seconds, and all devices will be completely still during that time.)

Currently working on a project where I need to mechanically and electrically connect a piece of anodized aluminum to the rest of an assembly (mating part is steel). I'd like to do this with a rivet for ease of installation but it is currently being done with a type of lockbolt with special ""grounding features"" on the underside of it's head like [this](https://www.hfsindustrial.com/us/media/catalog/product/cache/8a48491d021b9c2157e289ac8605f3d7/s/e/self-grounding_bobtail.jpg).

I've seen some applications that use a blind rivet and on the blind side an external star washer and another washer on top of that. Ideally I'd like to bring this down to a single washer, but cannot find any solid washers with these grounding features for cheap. Do they exist? Is there an alternative to the double-washer method? Ideally they would have a similar grounding feature pattern on one or both sides. It doesn't seem like using a rivet on just the star washer would work (blind side head size too small).

For my application I really don't want to use the lockbolts and want to stay with a blind rivet (or other cheap blind fastener). I also cannot remove the anodization (ie sand it off).

All ideas are welcome!

I've now learned that there is a dividing tee junction about 1/3rd of the way along the long pipe run, and this branch has a 1"" nominal bore.

Both the main and branch lines lead to two separate outlets that are at the same pressure, and I need to determine the outlet flow rate is at the main branch.

So my question is - since the cross-sectional area of the branch pipe is 1/4 of the area of the main pipe, can I just assume that the flow rate into this branch is also a 1/4 of the flow rate in the main line upstream of the tee? My feeling is that this would be an over-estimate as the flow ""wants"" to carry on going straight down the main line and it isn't as simple as just assuming a linear relation between the flow rates and cross-sectional area ratios.

But I know you want  cladding to cover it and ideally have a good water shedding, air gap, air/weather barrier to protect that insulation - so just using cables from corner to corner would probably be too flexible.

To me ""how hard water flows"" is a function of waters mass flow rate and therefore its the same thing?

If I stand directly in front of a pipe outlet, and the water is coming out at 15 l/s, then surely its the mass flow rate is what is causes me to feel 'how hard' the water is flowing against me? 

I don't understand how pressure would even come into that equation? What difference would it make if the water was coming out at 3 bar vs 4 bar? 

I sort of understand the pressure is related to flow, so because of the increase in pressure will cause an increase in flow. But why does this impact 'how hard' the water is flowing?

I can run 0.02 m3/s (possibly more) continuously at a dynamic head of 90 m (9 Bar). This can supposedly generate 15.9 kW at 0.9 efficiency.

The problem I've discovered is that standard turbines are designed not for high head, low flow, but instead the opposite. Here are some example turbines that are commonly available:

Rated output|Water head|Water flow
3 kW|15-30m|0.015 - 0.03 m3/s
5 kW|15-40m|0.015 - 0.04 m3/s

20 kW|30-70m|0.075 m3/s

My question is what would be the result of trying to run a low head, high flow turbine with water coming through at high head, low flow?

According to my limited understanding of how a hydro turbine works, the resistance to turning provided by the magnets in the stator should prevent the rpm from going too high assuming that the turbine is adequately sized for kW, so I wouldn't think it would blow up or anything if the pressure is too high, and as the potential energy (?) in the water is the same, the turbine would still turn, with the result would be the turbine would run but possibly at a lower efficiency.",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,282131.0,public,self,"Hydro electric turbines for high head, low flow",0.0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/ww3tn8/hydro_electric_turbines_for_high_head_low_flow/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Let's say we want to create a 24v system, so we put two 12v batteries in series. Let's double the capacity by adding two more 12v batteries, wired in series with each other but wired in parallel with the first two batteries. 

So, now we have a 24v battery pack with a greater capacity. 

Now, let's discharge the system to 12v nominal. If all four batteries are equal, they should all be at 6v. So, now we connect those four batteries in series, bringing the system to 24v nominal. 

Okay... I know this all works **in theory,** and I know that it could be done in practice. What I don't know is:

1. Can this be done in a usable way? If so, how? (Relays? Some type of automatic wire switching connector?)
2. What kind of capacity should be expected after doing the switch? My understanding is that batteries are usually manufactured to maintain voltage for as long as possible, but when it starts to drop, it drops fast. So, if it takes one hour to drop from 24v nominal to 12v nominal, how long should it take to drop down to 12v after the switch? Another hour? Half an hour? Fifteen minutes?
3. Is there any type of battery where this is safe to do? I know lead acid batteries can't handle it. What about LiFePo4 batteries, could they handle such discharging?
4. Is there a better method of doing this? Like, say using three batteries per bank (36v system) and three banks, and then doing the switch (different wiring, of course) when nominal voltage goes down by a third?

My question is: what would be the main reason for that, would that be for a more linear, hence more controllable force output? Or is there something else that I'm missing?

Those solenoids I mentioned are custom made ones, from diverse manufacturers, the application consists of having a solenoid being PWM'ed through a range of different currents to achieve different forces, from very soft to hard strikes (usually overvoltaged).

(So here's a diagram)[https://imgur.com/72adOXK]
(And here's a real version of it)[https://imgur.com/yFm3MUt]

The screens traverse horizontally and vertically, sometimes diagonally when combining the 2 systems (the upper wires haul it up/down, the carriage underneath tracks).

The issue is, when the screens track at speed (~800mm/s at the fastest), they obviously swing, then impart that swing into the truss/lines above, gaining me 2 pendulums initially, then 1 very big pendulum after they reach the same frequency.

They continue to swing for ages. That is then compounded by the next tracking move, and the cycle starts again.

Does anyone have any ideas on how I might elegantly go about at least dampening some of that sway?

I've already given generous accelerations and decelerations to the movement, and suggested slower moves, but creative minds and physics aren't a great combination apparently.

I've considered:
- Making the lines for the second drift to the screen more rigid. I don't think this will work because I think the uppwer lines initial counter swing acts as a dampener. I think this just adds more stable mass to the whole pendulum.

- Adding a tank of water or something to the back of the screen, I think it kind of achieves the same thing of the initial dampening, but will eventually just add more mass. That said, the initial big swings are my primary concern. I am also mildly concerned about sound from water sloshing around.

- Shortening the drop. The screens are suspended on 6m lines below the truss, shortening the drop will reduce the pendulum, but seeing the truss when the screen is dropped in to the floor isn't acceptable.

- Adding elastic guide lines for the top truss to track along. I think this one will do a lot to counter it, but the winches driving the system are powerful, and I'd rather not rip things apart if a truss swings into whatever outrigger etc I'd need to place under the truss to make it work.

For a little backstory, I've been into optics and night vision for some time now. While it is a niche hobby it produces a lot of weird (and cool) side technologies.

Unfortunately, usually these niche inventions for an already small hobby community means the designs are outdated, rare, expensive or hard to make. Which brings me to my topic, ""colorTAC"". (Link to more information: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2019/08/09/friday-night-lights-colortac-cva-14-color-analog-night-vision/amp/)

The basics of analog night vision are that a tube amplifies light, both in the visible and IR spectrum, to the point where we can see very well in dim spaces. However these tubes don't distinguish or display different wavelengths of light and so you see a monochrome image. The colorTAC turns the monochrome image into color by spinning 2 color wheels very fast Infront of the objective and ocular lens. This is sort of the same way the first color image was taken, by overlaying three different monochrome images overtop of eachother.

The colorTAC has number of drawbacks though. It is large, heavy, expensive and rare. Not really a great combination of features, as even if you could find/afford one, they aren't really very good because of the weight. They also have been designed for green night vision, which makes the color green look strange through white night vision (which is what I own). This brings me to my design.

I would like to find a color changing film that can be electronically controlled with a very fast pixel response time. The faster the colors change the better. I was thinking of an LCD display with no backlight but whatever material is chosen has to allow IR light to pass through. I think I can program an arduino to than controll the 2 LCDs to quickly flash identical colors synchronized.

Can anyone think of a better solution? Does anyone know a good source for an RGB LCD without a backlight so that the display is translucent?

I have a hunch here, but I just want to confirm my suspicion. In the above example, if datum plane A were referenced in the lower segment on the callout, the smaller tolerance zone(s) of Ø0.2 would be constrained perpendicular to datum A. (That is, the pattern remains spaced 30x50, but could shift and rotate within the larger tolerance zones of Ø0.6.) 

And if it *also* included datum B, the zones would further be constrained parallel to datum B. Meaning the pattern would no longer be able to ""rotate"" and could only translate/shift within the larger tolerance zones.

But in the example shown above, with no datum reference in the bottom segment, there is no orientation control to datum A or B. Meaning the smaller zones can now tilt out of perpendicularity with datum A.

**My question is:**  In this case, as the smaller Ø0.2 zones can now tilt with respect to datum A, must all four of them in the pattern remain parallel to **one another**? Meaning, the entire pattern must theoretically tilt as one? I believe this is the case, because I think the bottom segment positional tolerance still controls the ""spacing""  of the pattern features relative to one another, and it doesn't make much sense if they can each be oriented differently from each other. But I just wanted to confirm.

This will be useful for people doing outreach to under served areas, people looking to broadcast real time high resolution (and high quality) video of natural wonders like the aurora, less developed regions (especially indigenous), rainy days in rain forests, etc.

**I noticed that:**

1. All of the latest attempts for Low Earth Orbit satellite internet use separate frequencies up and down.
2. Lynk Global and AST SpaceMobile has a lower capacity and spectrum for up and down. To be fair, they're targeting mobile phone integration. AST Spacemobile however has more spectrum than Iridium despite using frequency division duplex (FDD).
3. There are satellite TV operators that use the S-band. One of them is in Indonesia.
4. Companies trying to enter the high speed Low Earth Orbit satellite internet market use Ku and/or Ka bands despite the previous point.
5. The ""broadband"" division from Iridium has end user units that weigh 2.8 kg and up to 7 kg. The speed up and down per user is not that good.
6. If AST Spacemobile used time division duplex (TDD) instead, the spectrum adds up to 628 MHz.

This is for 4K/8K broadcast from remote areas with HLG 10 bit HDR and LongGOP compression.
2. What would it take to get more frequency ranges and spectrum for allowing more capacity per user?
3. If antenna bonding is supported for users, would it make sense to also have kits for the users to create a mesh network with more than one satellite antenna? This is for helpful redundancy in the event one on Earth satellite antenna goes offline in the small area.
4. How should I go about connecting with people?
5. What's your advice on just making it happen and in general?

How honest have you been in them? How honest should you be?

Here's why I ask...

My boss' boss has decided we need to do stay interviews within the next few weeks.  I am in a uncomfortable limbo position where I've pretty much given up on this gig as a dead end job but I'm not 100% ready to jump ship yet.  I'm struggling with whether I should handle this as fluff BS like I always have in the past or if I should take a gamble and lay out the truth in the hope something can shift back to the high hopes I had at the beginning. 

Here's the ""truth"" so you can judge the level of risk...

3 years ago I was a Staff Mechanical Engineer at a fortune 500.  The toxicity finally broke me. I found a small company (not engineering or product focused) that was building an engineering department from the ground up to make their own products, which I had been right hand man to such an effort in a previous company and was uniquely qualified in a few other areas as well.  I had the chance to build the department the way I wanted and had a real shot at breaking into leadership to take that next career step.  I made such ambitions known in the interview(s) and they were well received.  I loved the culture here too.  So I told them to match my current salary and I was all theirs, reporting directly to the CTO with a generic title of Mechanical Engineer. At the time it was just me and a Staff level EE, also generically titled as an EE.

That was my lens going in.

A month after I started the CTO coldcocked us by hiring a Director of Engineering from a different fortune 500 (a finance manager no less).  We never saw it coming. With this new director came a lot of fortune 500 culture I had just escaped.  It has only gotten worse since.

My door to leadership wasn't totally closed with this director's hire. In fact, about a year later, there were discussions of what trainings I would be sent through in the coming months to prepare me for that step.  Then, after about 4 months of those conversations with no actual actions following, they hired an engineering manager over us to report to the director. Another F500 transition.  All conversations of me reaching leadership stopped the day they anounced his hiring and have not resumed in the subsequent year.  My reviews still come back with nothing but compliments and ""keep up the good work"", but my shot at management is obviously long gone.

My pay, along the way, has inched up at the standard 3% per year.  Due to small company benefits, I'm still not even making the take-home I was before I came here.  With double digit price increases on nearly everything in our monthly budget, we're now back to the good ol' days of living paycheck to paycheck.  

THEN, the new manager and the director decided that we should put our big boy britches on and have level titles like the big boys.  The EE I started with gets the title he came in with: Staff EE.  I, on the other hand, get the title of Senior ME.  So with the best of intentions, they gave me a demotion.

So I came to this company for the culture I liked, the opportunities I wanted, and pay that was ""ok"".  But now I'm in a position where the culture is changing rapidly in the wrong direction, the opportunities have clearly vaporized, the pay is almost untenable, and if I work really, really hard and I'm a really good boy for another 2 years, I'll make it all the way up to......... exactly where I was 3 years ago (which will be 5 years ago by then).

So what would you do?  Give my manager the truth about how I see my future here and risk them not being able to trust me in the hopes some change will come, or just smile and nod and start looking again when I'm ready to go?

FWIW, this is a ""recession proof"" job, which is near the front of my mind given the direction the U.S. economy is headed at the moment.

A: Possible to do  
B: Doesn't compromise the structural integrity of the monitor arm fixtures.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm working on a cable-less desk setup using an electric sit/stand desk (Desk =  (70"" x 30"" x 2-2.5"") &amp; Frame = Dual Motor maximum load: 125KG) and one of the hurdles I'm facing is monitor placement.

My ideal monitor setup is to include 3\* 32"" monitors on a triple monitor stand for production / workflow &amp; a 49"" ultrawide for gaming / movies etc.

For the triple monitor stand I'm using the [HUANUO](https://www.amazon.com/Triple-Monitor-Stand-Articulating-Aluminum/dp/B084RF63FK/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3BYZO63OJBXHN&amp;keywords=triple+monitor+stand+32+inch&amp;qid=1656529410&amp;s=electronics&amp;sprefix=triple+monitor+stand+32+inch%2Celectronics%2C176&amp;sr=1-3) Triple monitor stand with grommet passthrough

For the Ultrawide monitor stand, I currently I have the [WALI](https://www.amazon.co.uk/WALI-Monitor-Aluminum-Adjustable-GSM001XL/dp/B07NLMLLT6?th=1) Heavy Duty Monitor stand also with grommet passthrough (it says 35"" but some review pages have mentioned it can do 49"").

Although I'm thinking I might swap for an [Ergotron](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09JPNSVSV/?coliid=I3GA3W4CNSIFYW&amp;colid=12L2V23DBWQCA&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) HX Monitor Arm which shows it can support up to 49"".

Originally I thought about having the HUANUO in the middle with triple monitors and the WALI to the left-hand side and when I wanted to watch movies / play games, then I could pull it in front of the HUANUO but then I figured it would kind of mess up the aesthetics of the desk and also mean I'd have to move speakers etc in order to be within the ideal position for audio.

So I've pondered the idea of sticking the WALI in the middle of the desk behind the HUANUO and then lifting the ultrawide above the triple monitors and then placing it in front when I want to use only the ultrawide.

This was great in theory, but in practice I don't think the WALI allows a large enough range of motion to allow it to be lifted up above and over the 32"" monitors.

So finally I'm at my current idea, to mount the WALI's grommet onto/on top of the Steel pole that fits into the HUANUO stand and will house both the triple monitors and the single ultrawide on top.

But I'm sceptic and I wondered if:

1. Is this physically possible?
2. If possible, what modifications would I have to make in order for this to work?
3. Is there anything already out there that modifies the steel pole to do this?
4. Would I have to replace the pole entirely and do a custom mounting system
5. Would the steel pole even take the extra strain or would I have to change the material to something like Titanium?

I did wonder for question 1, if I could use the existing HUANUO grommet mount and instead extend the screw hole inside of the pole to the top of the pole and just get a longer screw which will screw the WALI/Ergotron mount securely onto the pole &amp; then mount the HUANUO like usual but not too sure if that would work or not.

Anyone got any suggestions / tips?

**Note:** Please keep in mind I've already looked at possibly wall mount, however because my setup is about ergonomics and incorporates a sit/stand desk, I don't want to be having to adjust the wall mount every time I want to stand/sit and so it would be more beneficial for me to have it mounted to the desk or the steel pole instead.",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,277686.0,public,self,Need advice - Possible to mount a heavy duty monitor arm on top of a computer pole (designed for triple monitors),0.0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/vpy34i/need_advice_possible_to_mount_a_heavy_duty/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been struggling with finding a solution for the following in a personal hobby project of mine for the last six months, so I figured I'd try putting a bounty, paid through PayPal, on it for anyone who can help me get it working. I've been trying to create a modification of sorts for a [Sony XDR-F1HD HD Radio](https://www.wtfda.org/mem/xdr-f1hd-SERVICE.pdf), which is a radio that's famously good at picking out distant signals. As part of the HD radio feature, the main module exposes the digitized RF baseband with a pair of I2S lines carrying the digital samples. I'd like to piggyback off of these lines and write the raw samples to an SD card.

## The Problem

The interface I'd like to capture consists of the I2S word select and bit clock lines as well as **a pair of I2S data lines** each carrying one channel of PCM samples. The **bit clock runs at 10.4 MHz and the word select line runs at 325 kHz**. Since each I2S data line is carrying one channel, this gives a sample rate of 650,000 samples/sec at 16 bits/sample. With two channels of this, the effective data rate is **20.8 megabit/sec or 2.6 MB/s**. Additionally, the bit clock and word select clock is generated by the module, so whatever I use to capture must work as a ""rx slave"" device and not generate the clock itself.

[Here is a timing diagram I modified to show how this works.](https://i.imgur.com/zFM4Alo.png)

I'd like to take this parallel I2S stream and continuously stream it onto an SD card's filesystem as a file so it could be read as a two channel, 16 bits/sample, 650 ksps audio file on a computer later. Any modern decent SD card should be able to handle 2.6 MB/s pretty easily over SDIO, but likely not via SPI. I'm looking for a microprocessor or chip of some sort (that I'll refer to as a controller from here) that could accomplish this task. Ideally I'd be able to send the controller a command via i2c or something similar to ""start recording to &lt;x filename&gt;"" and another command to ""stop recording"". I'd also like the controller to support *at least* a FAT32 filesystem, although I'd be more ideal to have a (Windows) filesystem that can handle files &gt;2 GB. It's also come to my attention that SD cards can sometimes stall for up to 250ms at a time, so whatever controller I go with would need to be able to buffer 250ms (0.65 MB) of data in RAM as it's waiting to be written.

## What I've Tried

First, I tried purchasing an ESP32 microprocessor to use. Unfortunately, while the datasheet claims it supports bit clocks up to 80 MHz, [that apparently only applies in master mode where the ESP32 is generating the clock](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/616949/esp32-high-sample-rate-i2s#comment1627785_616949) and not in slave mode where it needs to lock onto the external clock as is required for this project. Otherwise, it'll drop bits and just read in junk. This is unfortunate, as I've found that the ESP32 has a fast enough SD card interface to accomplish this data rate if it could only clock in the bits fast enough. Additionally, it doesn't seem to have any support for the strange ""parallel"" I2S I have.

Next, I purchased a Raspberry Pi Pico and ran into essentially the opposite problem. With some cleverly crafted PIO (programmable IO) assembly code I was able to pretty easily capture the signal. However, it can't write to an SD card nearly fast enough, so I can only really capture as much that'll fit into RAM. Since I need recording to be continuous, this doesn't work for me. However, I was at least able to run an FFT using fftw3 (which ran surprisingly well!) and [confirm that the data over these I2S lines is what I'm after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/569234760149237768/989718765560266852/unknown.png).

Additionally, I tried a full size Raspberry Pi (which isn't really ideal for this project) but the GPIO isn't quite fast enough for my needs. It has the RAM and SDIO speed for it, but I couldn't find a way to clock in bits fast enough. I'd also like this to be as ""bare metal"" as possible so I'd like to avoid running on top of an OS if I don't have to.

## Summary

In summary, I'd be willing to pay a $40 bounty (via PayPal) to anyone that can help me find a microcontroller or chip of some sort that'll help me accomplish the following:

* Continuously capture the 16-bit PCM samples sent via a **parallel** I2S interface running at **20.8 megabit/sec (2.6 MB/s)**, clocked in from an external bit/word select clock, onto an SD card
* The data must be written onto a file on the SD card through a filesystem like FAT32, although ideally something like ExFAT or NTFS that supports files &gt;2 GB (although segmented files would be fine too)
* The microcontroller or chip must be able to buffer a bit of the signal to avoid dropping samples while the SD card stalls occasionally
* This is just a personally hobby project, not something I'm planning on manufacturing at scale, so whatever I use has to be at least a bit affordable (no $500+ dev boards please, haha)
* I'd appreciate a pretty ""fat free"" solution that doesn't require booting into an OS or something like that

I have programming experience so I'd be happy to write the software myself, I just need to find hardware that'll be capable of such a thing. I don't have any experience with hardware language for something like an FPGA though, so I'd have no clue what to do if I needed one of those.

Long story short, after some org reshuffling (happens) I went from a manager whom I respected dearly to working under a lead who admittedly has more authority over most of the work I do on a day to day basis. I used to work fine with her in the past, but it was always under the assumption that I was never truly answerable to her and I could always just dip out if I felt like things got too heated.

Now I'm directly reporting to her, and to be honest I pride myself on having pretty thick skin and putting the needs of the org chart/business first, but to tell the truth I really dread our weekly 30 minute 1:1's and am especially nervous about our first performance review together. I don't feel comfortable being honest with her about my own career plans, nor of the issues that I have working under her for fear of emotional retribution (if that makes sense)

I respect her technical judgment and she's quite good at what she does and doles out tasking very reasonably. She's absolutely not a villain and a good engineer. But personality wise her and I just clash. We don't laugh at each other's jokes, her way of talking and explaining things really just rubs me the wrong way (and I'm 100% sure my way of talking irks her as well), and our working styles are also polar opposites. She likes to take her time and carefully consider all options before making a move, and I'm more of a 'let's get in there and make a calculated move *now* and we'll fix damage and reassess when we're done' kind of person. I've observed both styles can work in the correct circumstances, so I don't fault her at all for hers.  

I've been fortunate enough to never have an incompatible manager in the past, so I guess this is going to be my first time. Some pros going for meL 
 
- at the moment I have no real desire to get top performer at the moment (long story)
- I've hinted to my skip level boss and my old boss that I had concerns working with her as a lead, so it's also in their head that I flagged this early on
- There is little to no question about my work efficacy under her purely based on story points and the amount of stuff I've been able to do, so that can't be used against me

My biggest concern is that working under her is really starting to stress me out, and I don't know what the best way is to tell her this, especially while remaining professional and courteous as we should all be.

I am in my senior year now.

I was a sophomore in HS on 9/11, ended up enlisting as a grunt in the Marines after HS. After I got out of the Marines I ended up working for an HVAC shop in Boston working in the Seaport when the highrise apartment boom began. I realized I wanted a more technical role, so I made a pretty drastic switch to the defense industry working on weapons systems for various agencies under a DoD contactor. I worked my way from the assembly line and into test and evaluation. This is when I really began to realize my interest in engineering. As a tech I did a lot of hands on testing. Thermatrons, salt fog chambers, mud testing (create from scratch with silica to various viscosities), FPI &amp; MPI testing, SPL testing, Chronograph, high speed camera to diagnose failures in systems that cycle too fast for the naked eye. I loved it but got bottlenecked because I began to get my hand slapped for wanting to dig deeper into the muck but unfortunately that wasn't my role. 

So I left industry to grab my BSME. I am insecure as hell in my mid-30's and just getting my degree. No idea what to expect next spring when I graduate. Not sure how much my T&amp;E experience is actually going to weigh in. Not sure how much my blue collar at heart mentality is going to fair in what seems a world where I feel like a foreigner. I mean I was a skater in HS, smoked weed in the parking lot, chased girls, hit all the parties on friday and saturday nights and did all kinds of stupid shit. I have tattoos up and down my arms from my days in the Marines and have a beard. I feel like everyone in HR is going to stare at me like I am a liability as soon as I walk in for an interview.

I brainstormed ideas for solutions since I was 10 years old. I self teach myself.

**The purposes of my idea are to:**

1. Enable multi gigabit per second internet in a unit that can be carried in a backpacking backpack without significant weight or size.
2. Cover 100% of the Earth including the poles.
3. Enable any valid use that comes to mind. Examples include internet access in a dense jungle, automated or manually triggered emergency alert systems, bringing access to indigenous populations in remote areas that need small air taxis for access (especially Alaska), internet for long distance transportation, low cost backup for terrestrial access, etc.
4. Reduce or eliminate the awkward line of sight challenge. It'll be especially useful for transportation (vehicles go under bridges at times), and quickly deploying in a dense forest.
5. Have high speed even on a rainy day in a dense forest.
6. Have low latency and high transfer rates.

**The ideas include for this challenge include:**

1. Using physical antenna designs combined with self interference canceling. I read a research paper (found with a Google Scholar search) about combining existing ideas for full duplex wireless with both analog and digital self interference canceling. In other words, the problem is addressed before and after taking the radio waves and converting back into 1s and 0s.
2. Use at least 100 MHz of spectrum. More is better if possible.
3. Instead of the Ka band, this will use the L band and/or the S band.
4. Allow high order QAM levels that the client can always lower if a high level is not needed.
5. Use established functions like spot beam, intersatellite links, packet switch relay on the satellite constellation, etc.
6. Allow third party companies wanting to use this satellite network without deploying their own from scratch to do so.
7. With or without this satellite service selling service to end clients (internet users), ground terminals will remain neutral by connecting to all available peering providers.
8. First party client devices can use different operators that use these satellites. Useful for allowing newer and innovative business models. It's like how terrestrial carriers often allow Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) to use their networks.
9. Third party operators can collaborate for proprietary devices for their uses (like automated emergency alert systems for vehicle collisions). This is also to enable innovative solutions.

**Questions:**

1. From a physics perspective (simple terms and industry terms), how would an ASIC system for digital based self interference cancelling function lower the electricity demand for this? The only thing I can imagine is that it strips out unneeded functions to lower physical distance electrons must travel (it sounds similar to shrinking node size for CPUs in which the physical distance is reduced to move electrons from point to point in less time for calculations)?
2. I know that with refraction based optics for cameras, uneven changes in velocity (speed and direction) of visible light causes problems. With radio waves, would using a the L band and/or S band reduce the problem with refraction caused by stormy weather?
3. Would using high level QAM (at least 256 QAM) raise the need for line of sight alignment of client antennas (simple terms and industry terms)?
4. When allowing third party companies to sell services direct to client, would it be a good idea for there to also have sell service direct to end clients? It's like a semiconductor foundry either fabricating for its use and others while some like TSMC only fabricate for clients to reduce conflict of interests. Why or why not?
5. What other things should I know (like challenges with this idea)?

Here is my situation:

I recently graduated from college with a degree in ME. I am in my late 20's, single and don't really have much going on in my life.

I currently work as a test engineer in a field with allot of future prospects. It requires me to travel internationally to customers and validate that it functions correctly. As someone who struggles with anxiety it has really taken a toll being away from home during those periods. We work pretty crazy hours. I average about 60+ hours per week, working night shifts and during the weekends when we are at the costumers site. When I return home I might get a few days off but then I am expected to be back to work. When I am here it is not unusual to work 10+ hour shifts.

The systems we are working on is very complex and allot of it goes waaay above my head. I often struggle keeping up with what we are doing day to day meanwhile my colleges instantly know how to tackle a problem. I feel stupid and stressed out about it.

My colleges are outgoing, driven and very positive, meanwhile I am pretty anxious on the job, stressed and not very talkative. Because of this I haven't made a terrific first impression so to speak and I just feel like I don't belong with the team.

All of this has really taken a toll on me. It was honestly not at all what I was expecting post graduation. I wanted a job that was relatively easy going, that I could clock in my 40 hours and go home and focus on activities outside of work. I wanted to take my workout more seriously and spend my free time doing other activities and be with friends and family.

Now I haven't had the time to go to the gym for the past month, I eat too little food, I am dropping weight and I have been underslept for the past months. I just don't feel well mentally.

This job takes allot of sacrifice from my personal life. It has gotten to the point where I am seeing a therapist to help deal with my issues. I am honestly considering just bouncing and take a job that is located at home, that is more easy going and with more regular hours so that I can focus on getting my health back on track. However I think I would be very disappointed in myself for giving up now. I don't know...

There are undeniably some very big pros with my job. We work for the most time outside and are not tangled up in meetings. While I am traveling away I am surrounded by amazing nature and during times off from work me and my colleagues are climbing up mountains and watching beautiful views. Other times we are out fishing. During the evenings we make BBQs and I sit there and listen to their stories. I will remember these cool experiences for the rest of my life.

Not to mention the pay. Because we work such odd hours and have so many long days, I can pretty much make more than twice the salary my friends make in an equivalent field. I probably make more then my manager.

What are your thoughts about this? Should I try and stick it out or should I start looking for another job?

I know very little to nothing about air terminal units/VAVs, or HVAC in general, so I read up on Price Industries' products (links below) to educate myself as best as I could to know how they work/how they're powered/etc. Here are the questions I have after reading them:

1. As mentioned already, my mechanical engineer wants to install a single duct air terminal unit with an electric coil. I'm currently under the impression that the electric coil is an additional option that's separate from the ""base product"". Is this the case or no?
2. Will the Electric Coil require its own circuit that's separate from the air terminal unit's/VAV's controller/PIC? (Price Intelligent Controller) Or can they share the same circuit / be on the same breaker? (The panelboard the circuit(s) will be on is a 208Y/120V)

That's all the questions I have for now. I understand it may be a lot and if further specification needs to be made, please let me know. Thank you all in advance.

I have also been offered a role as a QE (I know, everybody hates it) for GE Aviation. both have the same salary after COL is considered.

My main questions are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

\-What exactly is the role of someone with an MS in an NL? I don't have research experience, but the duties seem interesting. 

\-Is it better to start out technical and then decide if I want to pursue an industry role (in manufacturing)?

\-For those of you with an MS, how did you guys decide whether to go for the industry or NL route and did you like it? It seems that NL roles pay less but are more interesting, while industry roles can lead to higher salaries, but tend to be less enjoyable (ESP for QE).

\-I am worried/paranoid about choosing the NL role, turning down the QE position with the brand name company and in the city of my dreams, and then not getting the S Security clearance for whatever reason. Any advice with that in mind?

\-If I am more concerned about $$$, should I go the industry role and hop around internally a bit to get a feel for the manufacturing industry? Like will that help in terms of future prospects? 

\-Would my MS be for nothing if I choose to go the industry route?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry about the mountain of questions. This is my first job as an engineer, and I have very little experience. Not to mention this sub has made me fear the QE role.

I had to disassemble the wheel chairs of course but well worth the effort.

I also have 4 John Deere riding mower tires similar to [these](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814bJOoy3+L._AC_SL1500_.jpg); they are the same size however the ones I have already have a keyway in them.  You'll notice of course that they have no mounting holes in their hubs.

My solution to this problem is as follows:

1. Mount a pillow block bearing on the outside of the body of the robot
2. Mount another pillow block bearing on the inside, but facing backwards.
3. Bolt a piece of steel that is the same size as the inside pillow block frame
4. Bolt the motor's default mounting to the piece of steel.

Another option of course is drilling holes into the hub of the tires I have, but I am concerned about ruining the tires while doing so

These are the solutions based on the tools and skills I have.  I don't know how to create a CAD drawing and have it 3D printed, or CNC machined online.

The upfront time investment in learning CAD just to design this piece makes it less practical than using the tooling and experience I already have.

Looking for assistance in finding the optimal way to configure a belt drive with two driving motors, idler pulley(s), &amp; one driven pulley (wheel)

This is for a fairly high torque setup. 

Included is an absolutely abysmal diagram made on iPhone stock photo editing. Away from my torrented solidworks for a bit &amp; trying to help a friend.

Basically trying to get verification that this picture would be optimal, as my non-engineering friend has something a bit different going on.

https://imgur.com/a/sQxAkBT

In picture, not accurately lined up but hopefully you can get the jist - motor pulley outer edge tangent to respective driven pulley outer edge.

Idler pulley either in line center to center with driven pulley, or in line with midpoint of driving pulleys. I imagine because math those two things may be the same, hard to tell with the pic I grabbed.

Then finally, idler pulley edge closest to driving pulley tangent with driving pulley edge closest to idler. Essentially all edge points of respecting circles end up being on the same line.

Sorry if this sounds like it was written up by somebody stupider than a drunk 5 year old. Essentially currently am, long night &amp; a lot of booze, &amp; not the type that makes you better at talking CAD/engineering.

Also, if the general idea of the pic is incorrect, please let me know &amp; try to point me to what is correct.

Tightening torque used could not be found.

This bolt was used to hold the coupling flange of a 16 foot industrial agitator shaft mounted at the top of a tank, so it might have been the torsion that made it snap. (see drawing)

At the bottom of the shaft, the key and hub on the impeller were also found damaged after inspection due to having lots of play inbetween them.

Under SEPEA, every possible password permutation will return an equally plausible cleartext result.

I am in my 20's, single and don't really have much going on in my life.

My job is testing hardware and software in a field with allot of future prospects. It requires me to travel internationally to customers and validate that it functions correctly. As someone who struggles with anxiety it has really taken a toll being away from home during those periods. We are working pretty crazy hours. While we are there, we work 60+ hours per week and work night shift and during the weekends. While at home, we get a few days off and then it is not unusual to be working 10+ hours work days here. Not to mention, the systems we work with is very complex and allot of what we are doing is going waaay above my head. I often struggle keeping up with what we are doing day to day meanwhile my colleges instantly know how to tackle a problem. I feel stupid and stressed out about it.

My colleges are outgoing, driven and very positive, meanwhile I am pretty anxious on the job, stressed and not very talkative. Because of this I haven't made a terrific first impression so to speak and I just feel like I don't belong with the team. 

All of this has really taken a toll on me. It was honestly not at all what I was expecting post graduation. I wanted a job that was relative easy going, that I clock in my 40 hours and go home and focus on activities outside of work like working out and being with friends and family. Now I haven't had the time to go to the gym for the past month, I eat to little food and I am dropping weight and I also get very little sleep. I just don't feel well mentally.

There are undeniably some very big pros with my job. While I am traveling away I am surrounded by nature and during times off from work me and my colleagues are climbing up mountains and watching beautiful views. During the evenings we make barbecues and I sit there and listen to their stories. It is pretty cool actually.

Not to mention the pay. Because we work such odd hours and have so many long days, I can pretty much make more than twice the salary my friends make in an equivalent field.

However this job takes allot of sacrifice from my personal life. It has gotten to the point where I am seeing a therapist to help deal with my issues. I am honestly considering just bouncing and take a job that is located at home, that is more easy going and with more regular hours so that I can focus on getting my health back on track. 

What are your thoughts about this? Should I try and stick it out or should I already start looking for another job?

Most motorcycle riders have learned to not buy/use black motorcycle gloves, because gloves being directly exposed to the sun during rides, black attract a lot of heat. 

Black being your worst ennemy when it comes to heat absorbtion is a given, but what about the material used in the gloves ? 

One question I have is leather vs mesh kind of gloves (example of mesh gloves :  [https://www.alpinestars.com/products/copper-gloves?variant=31614551785530](https://www.alpinestars.com/products/copper-gloves?variant=31614551785530) ). Let's imagine both the leather and the mesh gloves are white, would the material factor in much ? Would leather absorb more heat than mesh ? Is there a general rule to that, like the more denser and heavier the material, the more it absorb heat ? 

The second question is regarding carbon fiber or thermoplastic. Most gloves features knuckleguards for metacarpal bones protection (example here : [https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0508/5085/7149/products/3567319-1231-800-800-MantainAspectRatio\_800x450.jpg?v=1606843531](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0508/5085/7149/products/3567319-1231-800-800-MantainAspectRatio_800x450.jpg?v=1606843531) ) Most of the time, those knuckles guard are black or in very dark tone. The thing is, they're not directly in contact with the hand, there is some padding between your skin and those guard. Does it matter if they're black in this case ? Does carbon-fiber and thermoplastic absorb heat much ?

We are experimenting with a somewhat new and obscure tech called TVWS. It is essentially two way (subscriber unit(s), and base station) data radio in the UHF band 470-700\~ mhz. We have a base station that has one shared transmit and receive port (E.G. TX and RX run on the same line to the same outdoor base station antenna. -Recently the FCC granted a large increase in the ERIP of these systems and we want to see what kind of range we can achieve with this unit boosting the power to 10-20 watts from its current 500mw via an external amp.

How can we amplify the output of this base radio, but still deliver the received signals from the subscriber units back to it considering we cannot separate the RX and TX sources at the base transmitter? 

*-I am finding MANY VHF/UHF band amps that would fit the TX bill nicely. But they appear to be unidirectional and would render the system useless by blocking the uplink signals of the subscriber units back to the base station.

Hello,

I am working on a robotic project that is to take a boxer bob and rotate him with an input from an external sensor.

Some notes:

I will use a PD controller that will receive an external sensor input to generate a target, I am not sure if I will use a simple proximity sensor, or a more complicated sensor that looks for certain signals (the colour red for example). The error in the PD controller will be controlled by a rotary encoder.

For my first step of the project I have to size a motor I have made an attempt I am not sure if I have done it right. Would it be okay if reddit could critique my design methodology?

To size the motor first I determined an RPM by simply moving around the dummy (I have one in real life), for a minute to determine what is a reasonable RPM that is required for this application, in this case I found it to be about 40, as in I was able to circle around the dummy at distance a user would be 40 times in one minute.

Then I found the moment of mass inertia by downloading a 3d model and approximating bob as a rectangle, rotating about a central axis. I calculated a value of 0.262 kg\*m2. I used the equation below.

I chose a design angular acceleration of 4.2 rad/s\^2, in one second bob will accelerate to his maximum required of 40 rpm = 4.2 rad/s.

From this information I calculated the maximum torque required for this application from the relation T = angular accel\* Mass moment of area = .262\*4.2 rad/s\^2.

**I get a motor that is required to produce 11.5 lb -in of torque, and 40 rpm.**

Does my math make sense, am I close to what is required to size a motor. I did some research on motor sizing and I came across a lot of information including something called the motor inertia to object inertia ratio I didn't factor that into my design.

Are my numbers realistic, if I am totally off the mark what are some good resources I can access for motor sizing?

Lastly what kind of price range would I need for a motor to do this application?

As in, accidentally using the 25.4rad/s angular velocity with other English units maybe, and getting an incorrect RPM for speed.

So I started taking this quality engineering class for my IE undergrad. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm really enjoying it! I know it is just a class and it doesn't replicate daily life at the job of course, but it's fun and I'm enjoying the learning experience.

I've seen alot of hate for quality engineering online though. I noticed alot of hate towards the field online though. One reason I saw is the fact that they have to check people and correct them, and they are seen as the asshole. This, I'm not too worried about. I'm not the most technical engineer by any means, but I do have very good soft skills and emotional intelligence, and that situation is something I'd feel comfortable navigating. However, are there any other reasons this job is so hated on the web? 

I'd imagine it really depends where one works as well. Work environment makes all the difference. Is there often a shit ton of OT and weekends/holidays?

Also some more random questions. If I work in a field that isn't quality but within IE, should I still pursue lean sigma six certifications? Moreover, I'm new to IE as I switched from mechE. What kind of projects should be on an IE resume? I know that the mechE projects I've done aren't super applicable to IE, so I'm curious as to how a college kid would go about that. Would I do a report on a scenario which I think could use improvement, and write about my idea(s) to improve the process overall?

So I’m probably not the typical graduate. I’ll be finishing my degree at 35 after a job as a lab tech and briefly, drafting. I’ve been at my degree 6 years, and in that time I’ve tinkered and had a whole heap of crazy projects. 

By no means am I actually skilled in these things, but I’ve learnt a shitload over the years by getting my hands dirty, failing often and having shop floor guys telling me why I’m wrong. I developed a product last year that I’m about to launch on amazon where I designed everything from the structure to the PCB to the software. Thought it would take me 6 months, ended up taking 12. I felt like I’ve drunk through a fire hose of DFM, DFA, Optimization and supplier management (the headaches are real!)

Unless my product explodes into something more than an interesting side hustle, I’m looking at where to start when I graduate. The assumption with most grad positions is that the employer is getting someone probably in their early 20’s, at their first real job, fresh out of the books and relatively naive. 

While I’m open to anything that looks promising and theres still MUCH to learn, I’m worried about selling myself short. Theres a lot of roles going within the 3-5 year experience bracket where I feel I wouldn’t be out of my depth, and  the few years experience they’re asking for seems more of a litmus test that the candidate is not completely green.

Here's the idea:


https://i.imgur.com/YgzrNag.png



We drill a hole at the level of the sea and put a pipe in it, so the water will flow on it's own into the Ram Pump. The pump will use the water's pressure to pump the water into a tall container, where dozens of other pumps will also be pumping the water. There, we'll use the water's energy to power the turbine to produce electricity. There's a hole in the container so the downstream pressure is not compromised. 



If we want to install a turbine with a 100 m3/s flow rate, then we just have to install enough pumps that will pump the water into the tank at the same rate. 10 pumps pumping 10 m3/s in my opinion is not a far stretch. On the contrary, I'm sure we could install more pumps with a greater flow rate.



The process could be strengthened by adding mechanical water pumps which would be powered by wind turbines. If the pumps are not turned on, the water flows straight ahead, and if we turn them on, the pump will create more flow pressure in the second channel:


https://i.imgur.com/H3y9XzY.png


As I said before, many more pumps would be used to fill up the same container. There's a ilustration from above how it could work:


https://i.imgur.com/056g7Od.png

&amp;#x200B;

**Units:**

As was stated in the site linked above, the units are as follows,

Q = flow (m\^3/s, in\^3/s)

A1 = area of entrance (mm\^2, in\^2)

A2 = area of venturi (mm\^2, in\^2)

p1 = pressure at entrance (Pa, psi)

p2 = pressure at venturi (Pa, psi)

P = fluid density (kg/m\^3)

&amp;#x200B;

**Equation on the site linked above:**

Q=v1\*A1=v2\*A2

p1-p2=p/2\*(v2\^2-v1\^2)

&amp;#x200B;

**Variables:**

Airflow = 0.02m\^3/s

Density = 2.5kg/m\^3

A1 = 78.5mm\^2 -&gt; (5mm radius entrance)

A2 = 19.6mm\^2 -&gt; (2.5mm radius venturi)

&amp;#x200B;

**Test:**

v1 = Airflow / A1 = 0.02 / 78.5 = 0.000255m/s (We take the Q=v1\*A1 formula and modify it to get v1)

v2 = Airflow / A2 = 0.02 / 19.6 = 0.00102m/s (We take the Q=v2\*A2 formula and modify it to get v2)

Pressure drop = Density / 2 \* (v2\^2 - v1\^2) = 2.5 / 2 \* (0.00000104 - 0.000000065) = 0.00000122Pa

As we can see here, if we follow the rules as stated there, we get a miniscule fraction of 1 Pascal! That is almost nothing! Clearly something isn't right, so I had a look through the equation, and noticed that even though the A1 and A2 variables are said to be in mm\^2, in reality they need to be m\^2! So I made the modification to the equation and tried again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Test 2:**

A1 = 0.0000785m\^2 -&gt; (0.005m radius entrance)

A2 = 0.0000196m\^2 -&gt; (0.0025m radius venturi)

v1 = Airflow / A1 = 0.02 / 0.0000785 = 254.8m/s (We take the Q=v1\*A1 formula and modify it to get v1)

v2 = Airflow / A2 = 0.02 / 0.0000196 = 1020.4m/s (We take the Q=v2\*A2 formula and modify it to get v2)

Pressure drop = Density / 2 \* (v2\^2 - v1\^2) = 2.5 / 2 \* (1041216 - 64923) = 1220366Pa

As we can see here, the pressure is now way too high! In bars that would be roughly 12.2 bars which is huge.

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone please tell me what is wrong or missing in this formula? Heck I even tried cm\^2 for A1 and A2 (which logically makes 0 sense whatsoever because that would only work for cm\^3/s, not m\^3. But I got curious) and it returned a result that was also kind of off.

I drive a Honda CR-Z which has a wheelbase of 243.5cm, track width of 150cm, mass of 1220kg, and a weight distribution of 60% / 40% (fr / r).
The stock tires are 195/55r16's on 6"" wide wheels +45 offset.
The stock pressure is 32psi front and rear.

I am looking to upgrade my wheels to something a bit better looking but they only come in the 7+""width variety. The ones i've selected have the same offset but are 8"" wide and 17"" diameter.
I'd be running 235/40r17's.
If you are wondering, the CR-Z can apparently take up to 9"" wide wheels with the same offset without scrubbing.

I did some reading on the physics of a wider tire to see if it would ruin cornering. This is probably the best reading I've found on the subject: https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/wider-tire-giving-better-traction-debate.330790/

My question is specifically what pressure should i run the new tires on such that i don't get excessive tire wear? I believe it should be lower than stock.

They mentioned that this was actually needed in order for the train to complete a full circuit around the track.

Similarly, a lot of rollercoaster don't have seats on the first car of the train, but have a non-seated car called the ""zero car"".

I'm working on a project aimed to detect when a continuous strand of paper/plastic is broken. I have a machine which continuously generates scrap as 1-2cm wide ""ribbons"" of bonded paper and plastic film. The plastic is a transparent 150um nylon, bonded to paper or Tyvek. Occasionally the scrap is all plastic film, or all paper. The scrap is collected by two wheels which wind to collect it as it's generated. My plan is to run this strand of scrap through an IR break-beam sensor, so that I can detect when the strand is broken (and thus no longer passing through the sensor). The scrap will move at about 10cm/s. I plan to connect this to an LED/buzzer as a proof of concept, and then eventually tie it into the PLC for the machine.

Do you all have any insight into whether an IR break beam sensor could achieve this? I'm concerned that the transparent/semitransparent nature of the material could make detection difficult.

I'm reasonably confident that i have calculated it correctly, however a colleague has challenged this method and suggested that the downward force needs to be halved as there is upward pressure being applied from the fixed part of the jig. Something to do with newtons law.

The below maths are based on:

* Tape surface area = **1667 mm2**
* **15 PSI** (required tape pressure per application notes) = **0.1034 N/mm2**
* **1 kgf** = **9.8067 N**

First calculating how many newtons are needed

**1667** (tape surface area) **x 0.1034** (required pressure in N/mm2) **= 172.4 N**

Now, this got me thinking. In internal combustion engines we only use one cylinder for power. The  exhaust gasses however still contain energy in the form of heat and pressure, so why are we not using another cylinders to harness this power? Especially now as manifacturers are trying to push even the smallest increases in efficency.

I know that there is a new rule regarding career posts - I reviewed it and this seems to fit the rules, but if it's not, please remove it.

I graduated with my master's in electrical engineering in the summer of 2021 with a focus on applied mathematics/optimization/algorithm development and biomedical applications. I've been working in academia since I graduated. I decided to switch into industry and have been offered two positions for my first full-time industry job. I'm torn on which to take and any advice would be greatly appreciated!
----------------------
Job 1:

* Research division of a large company that's known worldwide, but seems to have a dying reputation
* Salary: $97k + $7000 sign-on bonus
* Estimate of housing costs (for cost of living comparison): $1800/month in rent, $250k-400k houses
* Moving: $6500 lump sum for moving (my moving expenses won't be much, so I could pocket a lot of this)
* Retirement: 3% of base pay and 4% match, vests in 3 years
* PTO: unlimited
* Work-life balance: sounds like it's poor based on my interviews
* Work: Rotational program. I will start out working on either a controls/additive manufacturing or computer vision project, and then can rotate to other applications or groups that focus on different technical skills based on my interests. Applications could be anything - robotics, power, renewable energy, healthcare, etc. I'd also get to lead a technical project of my choice during the program.

Thoughts on the work: The ability to rotate through different groups and projects based on my interest is extremely appealing to me. The option to lead a project seems like it would be a great learning experience. Even after the program ends, getting to use one core set of technical skills for projects of different applications sounds very interesting - that's how I'd like to structure my career in an ideal world. I also think I'd get to be working on applications of more interest to me, that seem more relevant to day-to-day society, and that would be transferable to other jobs in the future. 
----------------------
Job 2:

* Highly-regarded non-profit research lab
* Salary: $112k
* Estimate of housing costs (for cost of living comparison): $1900-2000/month in rent, $450k+ houses
* Moving: covered by the company, but may not be grossed up
* Retirement: 2.5% base pay and 8% match, vests after a year
* PTO: 15 days + 7 sick days
* Education benefits: free schooling for up to 24 credits a year with no retention agreement and 200 hours of paid time off for dissertation work (important to me because I LOVE learning and would love to study some science topics I'm personally interested in that I couldn't otherwise afford to study, and I had also been strongly considering an engineering PhD at some point)
* Work-life balance: sounds like they have an unbeatable work-life balance and flexibility
* Work: Military. Could involve signal processing, control, optimization, etc. within a simulation environment

Thoughts on the work: I'm not very interested in doing military work, but the technical skills seem along the lines of my technical interests. A con is that I'm not sure how transferrable my work here would be to other jobs, given that it's a very niche application. I had the option to do biomedical work here instead, which I rejected because it seemed like it would only be data analysis. I may reconsider this though, if they'd still allow me to.

The US electrical grid is large enough that a 60hz signal on one side of the country being sent to the other would have a significant speed of light delay and thus phase shift. This feels like it would cause waves to interfere with each other and potentially cause problems. 

An extreme example could be a generator in Boston that provides power to a point in NYC through a direct cable but has another cable that loops out to the midwest and then back to NYC. The incoming AC waves from the direct cable and the long one that loops out to the midwest would be out of phase from each other. 

My question is, how does the grid handle this? 

Am I making some incorrect assumptions about the way the grid and the 60hz AC in it operate? Is thinking of AC as a wave coming from point source(s) a flawed model?

The bike has sentimental value to me so I'd like to give it a second chance at really having a life before giving up on it, but at the same time I do also under that ""all good things come to an end"".

So on to the dilemma: rather than deal with the antiquated and impossible-to-find-replacement parts (which also have overly inflated prices when I do find them), I am contemplating bringing this bike a little more up-to-date via an simplified fuel injection kit I can buy, being pretty much standalone outside of needing a crank trigger / sensor, which is where my question(s) come from.

So I have one main question related to electrical engineering, which depending on the answer to that one, will leads to the second question, which would be mechanical engineering. I am trying to do this on the cheap because life is expensive these days and I don't want to mess with paying a machine shop to fab one-off parts, so here goes:

1. Since the ignition system works, both the points+condenser as well as the centrifugal mechanical advance, could I use the existing ""signal wire"" that comes off the points (and tells the coil to unground) as my crank signal? Or would that signal be unreliable / too volatile to use as a crank ""sensor"" for a PCB? Asking because I know points are relatively high discharge. I'm not really worried about the timing of the injector in respect of the ignition too much since my bike is a 360⁰ parallel twin, so as one cylinder is going into combustion, the other would be going into intake giving me a little confidence that I could get away with batch firing the injectors and ignition at the same time, especially since I can always put in an injection trigger delay via the software I'd be using for creating the injection tables.

2. If the points would not be suited as my crank sensor, would adding a shaft collar (for a hall sensor based trigger) cause the mechanical advance to advance too soon or make it work extra hard? It'd be a balanced weight, I just don't know if adding more weight to the mechanism will cause it to advance earlier than normal or cause premature failure due to the increased rotational momentum, or if it will be theoretically fine as long as it's properly functioning in the first place (which it seems to be).",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,271206.0,public,self,a couple of electric / mechanical engineering questions relating to engines and fuel injection...,0.0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/u7qk8h/a_couple_of_electric_mechanical_engineering/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I stumbled into this website [TAD](http://www.viking-house.ie/tad-digester.html) that talks about a Thermophilic Anaerobic Digester and I'm very unfamiliar and intrigued with the mechanical part of it, since here in Europe we use mainly the mesophilic process and there is virtually no information clearly explaining how this ""new"" digester system works.

Can anyone draw a picture or a rough outline of the basic key components (chambers, inlet, outlet overflow, pump, fluid circulation, and overall how it functions? 

This site says that with its technologie they are able to reduces the digestion process from 30 days to 7 days, reducing the size of the tanks required and lowering the system cost. They also say they maintain the optimal pressure by transferring (passively) the digested cotent from the digestion chamber back to the loading chamber. 

I truly don't understand... where is the outlet? Is it perhaps connected to the sewer? what about the heating and pressure system? are both chambers at the same temperature and or pressure?

I found this article that talks about (what i think must be a key factor) the recirculation of the fluids to optimise the anaerobic digestion but again it's not clear at all how it's done and i would absolutely love to understand.

I don't mind if it takes time to fill the tank, I use water sparingly.

My plan is to spend minimum on this project.

Here are the specifics:

 \- 80-100 Watt Solar Panel 

 \- Water Pump - 12  Volt 4.5 to 6 amps, 220psi  Something like this [This](https://www.amazon.in/ANSH-Battery-Sprayer-Double-Performance/dp/B08V9CXHL7/ref=sr_1_4?crid=20E4SFA0GPSL&amp;keywords=water+pump+12v&amp;qid=1650211822&amp;s=garden&amp;sprefix=water+pump+12+v%2Clawngarden%2C164&amp;sr=1-4)

 \- 30 Feet of 1 Inch Pipe.

 \-Other Electronics to control auto shut off (Power source need not be from same solar panel).

Can this water pump the water at 30 feet? 

Will the motor last long enough? as it has silicone diaphragm inside and has to pump  around 500 Ltrs everyday?

the question to solve: Building climbing anchors in a highly corrosive area with a live sickle 100 years+.   
(Corrosion resistant to the ocean water and stone minerals in the actual Boulting zone).

Titan Anchors can be bought online from England, but transportation and import are very expensive. (Japan)   
so I want to make them myself, my biggest fears are that the Titan if bend gets cold forming cracks  
and making them extremely brittle, resulting in an unsafe and not lasting bolt. Hot forming with an induction coil and Argon Chamber   
is my 2nd option but if it does not work the investment for the setup is maybe a little expensive.

Anyone got other ideas on what to use or if the Cold forming will not compromise the structure etc.

Looking forward to your ideas and insight!

essentially heated up iso-pentane goes through a turbine at 2mPa, and comes out a condenser at 320K other info is below:

• Brine inlet temperature, TA=440 K

• Brine specific heat, cb=4.19 kJ/kg·K=constant

• Brine density=897.2 kg/m3 or 56 lbm/ft3

• Pinch-point temperature difference=5 K

• Preheater-evaporator pressure, P5=P6=P1=2.0 MPa

• Condensing temperature, T4=320 K

• Turbine isentropic efficiency=85%

• Feed pump isentropic efficiency=75%.

i want to find what the isentropic outlet state 2s, that is the enthalpy at 2s. i've filled in the above table with the relavant points i worked out, i think my question really just comes down too.. how do you interpolate knowing the entropy and pressure to find h (at state 2s)? do you find out the T first then use that to find the h?

Thanks for the great feedback and input in that thread and I agree with most of what was said, but was hoping for more specifics ideas and opinions on how to best process those changes.  The general consensus seemed to be that automation and AI will get rid low skilled jobs at an increasing rate, and even high skilled workers (not talking about just engineers here) will need to be more agile and be able to relearn requirements and skills for new positions.  

It used to be you could spend a lifetime getting proficient in one job.  Now if that job gets automated, or technologically assisted, perhaps using knowledge gained from someone else who spend a lifetime learning that job, that knowledge is largely useless and a new job needs to be found, and a new knowledge base developed, until the whole thing happens again.  

Easy to learn jobs will be few and with great competition. 
 More advanced jobs usually require advanced training, which costs money, there will likely be a greater percentage of the population who don't have the intellect to perform them, and they still won't provide financial stability.  Anyone who's been unemployed know's how devastating it can be.  Savings can be wiped out, health care, and even homes lost.   How can people and family thrive and advance when this could happen numerous times over a lifetime?  What, if anything, do you think needs to put in place to protect and help families with these kind of transitions? 

As an example: If there were a family who made a basic but acceptable living manually harvesting fruit, with the parents in their 40's and not much savings and this their only skill, and a way to automate the harvest was developed, they'd be out of work pretty quickly.

After working many years as an HVAC technician, I feel like I need a bit of a change, and I want to move into the design aspect of HVAC. Currently, I’m want to move to the system design aspect as opposed to equipment design, but I haven’t 100% decided.

Some background on myself: I’m in my early 30’s, married with a couple of kids.

I'm a recent ECE graduate currently job hunting, and I've genuinely got no idea where I fit or what I want to do or even if engineering is for me. I've tried writing this a couple of times so please bear with me.

I have serious impostor syndrome about my skills and university work. 

Some of my TA's and lecturers were the type to spout stuff about how they gave us ""more help than any class we've ever taught before, because you obviously need it it's unbelievable"", and praise the top, technically smart students by belittling everyone else's efforts and work. It's really messed me up. 

But I did work hard in university, I worked my ass off and I'm willing to bet it was on the upper end of the spectrum. But I was also focused on internships and part-time work just to get through. I never failed a paper, absolutely excelled in some, but there were others like the aforementioned that just robbed any pride or sense of deserving credit through sheer ignorance, incompetence, and asshole-ery. 

I've come out of university feeling like I've learned absolutely nothing. I don't know if I can programme a MCU, or make anything outside of a script. What's a header file? Where was I told what these sensors are or how they work, what actually is a serial communication and why is I2C so common but prone to blocking? I didn't know how to make a circuit board until I took up a project where a mechanical engineering student taught me. I spent the whole time doing nodal analysis, understanding what's inside an op-amp, feedback loops, control system theory.=, and how to make a buck converter from scratch. Where are my marketable skills in all of that? My industry experience has shown me that absolutely 0 of it was relevant apart from designing S&amp;K filters, what an ADC is, and what are caps, diodes, and NPN transistors. 

Some interviews I've had for an R&amp;D role have had a technical test sprung upon me in the middle of the interview where I'm asked to solve problems, particularly programming, on the spot. And I HATE that, because I was never lead to have any confidence in those skills. And talking to interviewers I feel like an idiot. But I have upskilled independently! I taught myself Python through a free, renowned online course! I could teach you to program in Python! ""What, you didn't use it for anything at university or work?""

I'm lost, man. There are things I'm good at and enjoy. I love tackling sophisticated and MEANINGFUL problems to research from ground zero and ponder over a scientific solution that I put together in a Eureka moment. I love coordinating and managing people working on group projects, presenting ideas and collaborating and working together. I love reporting on progress and proposing new ideas to people that are well researched and valid and convincing. 

I'm good at all of these things. But damn if my studies and job hunting experience have made me feel like I'm not. 

I'm not sure it's even engineering for me anymore. I want to research and work with people on things like combatting climate change and conservation and space technology and advancing medicine and streamlining the industry and the world at large in an actually meaningful way. Not build a dishwasher or fuss over power supplies or the cost of MCU's or the O(n) of a program or figuring out where you left main.c and what else it needs to run.

Any recommendations for home gamer adhesives (for aluminum in a hot, vibrating environment)?

I am working on my application for P.Eng with APEGA and I am facing a problem: My validators are not P.Eng, although they have Technologist and bachelor's in Engineering.

Has someone recently applied and used a non-P.Eng validator?

APEGA sent me this information below:

 *If  your validator is not registered with an engineering regulatory body in  another Canadian jurisdiction, please identify the following:*

* *Professional designation*
* *Registration country*

***Please note*** *Your non-P. Eng./international validators may enter any random 5 or 6-digit number as the “License  Number” (Member ID), such as “00000”, “12345”, etc. and the designation may be entered as “Other Designation” while filling out the forms you will send to them. Additionally, your Validator may add a little explanation in the “Comment” section stating that “I am not a registered engineer, therefore the license number listed is not valid”. You may also want to ask your non-P.Eng. Validator(s) to send an email with a copy of the following attached to* [*registration@apega.ca*](mailto:registration@apega.ca) *and ask them to include your APEGA ID #, your first and last name, as well as the reason for sending the email: proof of their post-secondary education (engineering degree, etc.); copy of their resume.*

I just wanted to double-check if someone has any recent success case in using a non-P.Eng as a validator. I was concerned about paying the application fee ($325) to later have my application refused and restart the process.

what we need is a type of laser mechanism that will burn off any exposed facial hair only and not damage the skin. this can be done by either finding a wavelength of laser that will only be absorbed by hair and not by skin or guided laser system that shoots only hair follicles. once that's achieved, it's just a matter of scanning across the face and head to ""shave"" off unwanted hair after which all you'd have to do is wipe off the ash of burnt hair. shaving in less than a second!

Specifically, let's say your opening is for silicon/asic/rtl design and verification, and the candidate has been doing PCB/flex and product design for a long time, with some firmware, C/C++, verilog, etc. on the side, let's say normal amounts of other stuff, but not really career-defining amounts of ""other stuff"".  The last time the candidate touched silicon design was 20 years ago for a couple years out of grad school, and now wants to get back into this field.

The candidate is in late 40's and says this is what he's been wanting to do, like, forever, and is now finally trying to making it happen due to being basically bored of the same PCB stuff over and over.

Are you suspicious?  What red flags are there?  You understand that the longer someone is in a particular track, the harder it is to move somewhere else (i.e., you gain expertise and salary in the current less interesting track, while the other more interesting track progresses without you, with fresh blood from smart graduates), but then again if someone ""really wanted"" something then they would already have it and not wait this long.

Or do you welcome that someone is willing to take a few steps backwards and bring in a broader experience and knowledge generally to learn a new skill while (hopefully) contributing meaningfully?

How do I change tracks from ""connect the dots"" PCB design to silicon where the smarts of the system really happen?

I'm (26M) and recently got a pretty great job. Went from aerospace to engineering consultancy. I work remote and make just short of six figures (with my bonuses) in Arkansas (USA).

I want to keep climbing the ladder, and I know a lot of people push for engineers to take the F.E. and P.E. exams, but I have a B.S.M.E. and seem to be doing pretty well without them. 

I know that P.E.'s can make a *shitload* of bank signing off on designs and such, but if I can go without doing that, why bother? 

Background: I graduated in 2019 with a BSME and 4 internships where I did actual machine design. I worked in aerospace for just under 2 years before my current job. I'm proficient with most CAD software and can write code. I want to get into automation/simulation as a technical expert in the future.

So, I did it. 

Our house 1890 house went from effectively zero insulation/air sealing, with 2 box vents, and zero soffit vents for ventilation, to 16"" blown cellulose with 8 soffit vents and 6 box vents. Our attic has remained at ambient winter temperature all winter long, whereas it used to be much warmer due to heat leakage and minimal ventilation. This would cause snow to melt relatively quickly. 

Our house is a hip roof with a large bump out at a corner, which creates a large valley. Previously, our roof would shed snow fairly quickly due to heat accumulation in the attic. During the past two storms, we've accumulated significant snow on the roof, plus additional drifts from surrounding trees. At one point we during the last storm, we had upwards of 2 feet in the valley. Due to the roof geometry and large overhangs, I'm not able to reach anything with a snow rake. These now have me concerned.

I'm well aware that our framing is undersized, like most old homes.  Mix of 2x6 and 2x8's, with a 2x6 valley rafter spanning 12' connected to a 2x8 hip rafter which spans 18', plus supporting jack rafters off of the valley. Our attic ceiling joists are 1x6 and half of them aren't spliced where they overlap. By todays standards, it's not even close to code.

I'm now thinking that I may have opened pandoras box by altering the conditions which our home has stood for 130 years, by increasing snow load on our undersized framing.

The vacuum cups will be parallel to the ground and move the load in that direction via linear actuators. Speed isnt a concern so this can be as slow as 10mm/s. The load itself is unknown, but we are estimating for safety that the load will be less than 5kgs.

What we need to figure out is:
1. Size of cups and number of cups
2. Vacuum pressure required at each cup, which leads to how many ejectors needed (1 per cup, 1 per 2 cups, etc)
3. Compressor needed to supply based on loss from ejectors

Additionally, we couldnt agree on how the vacuum is split if we run 2+ cups on one ejector vs one cup on one ejector. What are the physics at play here? We reached a paradox where if you increased the area indefinitely, while maintaining the flow rate, speed would decrease which would increase pressure, but we cant land on why it wouldnt increase indefinitely as well.

Lastly, where can you find breakaway force of cups? No supplier we have found actually lists it.

The question I have is this, would it make sense from a feasibility and profitability standpoint to use plasma furnaces for waste disposal at our current landfills and then using that furnace(s) to furnish materials for 3D printer spools and other raw chemical materials?

From what I have read of plasma furnaces it’s possible to siphon off materials based on density. But I’m not sure if the extra steps necessary to then refine those material and form them into ingots or spools would make sense or be profitable. 

The other gases given off during the burn process can also be captured but I am not sure what the purity of those gases are. I know that the furnace can use certain gases obtained during burn to offset fuel use. Again I’m not sure how feasible or profitable that would be. 

The main interest is to remove the garbage and repurpose the land given up for landfills. While making enough money to ensure continued operation.

This question has been asked a fair amount, but I can't quite seem to 100% figure it out.  I'm trying to figure out if a known motor is powerful to rotate a known mass (or approximated) at a given rotational velocity, without much care for how long the acceleration period is - (i.e. anything &lt;10min is fine).  

I have a given [motor](https://www.mcmaster.com/6331K16/) which I know the continuous operating torque (21in-oz at 3000rpm) and startup torque (159in-oz).  In SI, that would be 0.148 Nm @ 3000rpm (315rad/s) and 1.123 Nm.  The power output of the motor is listed at 0.006hp, which would be 4.474 W.  The motor is a 24V DC motor with full Load current listed at 2.4A.  I believe the startup torque is the same as the stall torque; correct me if I am wrong.  

* The first thing I'm a little unclear on is the power output.  Using the continuous operating torque parameters, the continuous operating power output should be, I think, 0.184 Nm \* 315 rad/s = 57 W.  Using P=IV, 24V\*2.4A = 57.6 W... okay that makes sense.  But then this is way higher than the listed horsepower of 0.006hp=4.474W right?  Am I missing something here?  What does the listed horsepower mean?

Okay, so onto the problem.

I have a mass which is a hollow egg shape which I would like to rotate along the same axis as the motor's axis of rotation. For now I am treating it is a hollow sphere. The mass of the sphere is about 40lbs, or 18kg.  The diameter of the sphere is 36in, so let's say a radius of 0.5m. Using the moment of inertia formula for a hollow sphere (1/2mr\^2), that gives I = 2.25 kgm\^2.  

It will be mounted onto a 1/4"" diameter 1045 steel shaft 24in"" long.  With a density of 0.284lb/in\^3, I think that this contributes negligibly to the moment of inertia for the purpose of these calculations.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  I haven't yet planned the internal frame inside the sphere which will mount onto the shaft, so I'm ignoring it for now for the purpose of these calculations.  

Okay, so let's say I want to rotate the sphere at 1200RPM = 1200 RPM = 20 rev/s = 125 rad/s.  As long as the duration of the angular acceleration takes &lt; 10min, I am happy.  Let's say I set the duration to 400s then, I get an angular acceleration of 0.1pi rad/s\^2 =\~ 0.3rad/s\^2. It's fine if it ends up faster as well.

I know that torque is the produce of the moment of inertia and acceleration, but I am unclear about how to use this given that I know startup torque and continuous operating torque and moment of inertia, but not the angular acceleration.  

* Taking the product of the moment of inertia and the acceleration above, I get 0.675 Nm.  This is less than the startup/stall torque, but I don't know if it's fair for me to simply set the acceleration arbitrarily long like that.  I'm also sure that the acceleration and torque don't stay constant as the motor is speeding up...
* Alternatively, if I take the startup torque and divide it by the moment of inertia, I get what I think should be the max starting acceleration: alpha = 1.123Nm / 2.25kgm\^2 =\~ 0.5rad/s\^2.  This would get up to the desired angular velocity in 250s, which is completely fine.

What I am ultimately having trouble understanding I guess is what the initial mechanical startup torque is that the motor's startup torque needs to overcome. I think mechanical startup torque is the correct word for ""what it takes for to set the object into motion.""  I have a feeling that maybe this value would interact with the listed startup torque and the motor's listed power, but I'm not sure exactly how to figure this out.

My first year at Tesla: Absolute dream opportunity right out of college. Great team with great diversity despite being the only female on the team. My 1st manager gave me challenges and visibility when I conquered them. I was so motivated to work hard. I was promoted to Senior Engineer after 1 year. On the same day, one of the Senior Engineers on my team got promoted to Associate Manager and became my new manager.

Everything. changed.

My new manager (let's call him Prasad), male and roughly 3 years older than me is a self-proclaimed ""jerk"". Here are some stories:

* I got a request from the director of our team with a 1-week deadline. In 1-week was Thanksgiving break. I asked if the following week would be ok because of the holiday, and the director had no problem with it. Prasad quote: ""\[our director\] never would have let anyone else have an extension. It's probably because he has a daughter your age""
* Prasad schedules a virtual meeting with me and my original manager. He demands that I stop working on the project I am currently assigned to and immediately begin working on his project. I state that I have 1 more task remaining and I will be able to support his project beginning tomorrow. Prasad gets angry, raises his voice, states that I am not doing enough and that I must learn to do more projects at one time. My original manager immediately leaves the meeting and begins calling my cell phone directly, apologizing for the way Prasad is speaking to me.
* Quote: ""When you're in this role long enough, you become a d\*ck"" (beaming)
* Interviewed 2 candidates to be my technician. Candidate A was driven, positive, professional. Candidate B was unclear, negative, lacked self-awareness. I voted for Candidate A. Prasad: ""I really like Candidate B, he's kind of a d\*ck."" I disagree with him, saying we do not need another personality on our team. Candidates A and B are both hired by Prasad, but Prasad assigns me to Candidate B, the one I did not vote for.
* 2 months later, Prasad blames me for Candidate B's development, stating that Candidate A is doing much better and is extremely driven. I hold back stating that this is the precise reason why I voted for Candidate A, and instead swallow the feedback to try to be a better leader/talent developer.
* Quote: ""I'm going to begin putting more pressure on you. I'm not kidding, when \[current director\] was my manager, he used to cuss me out in our native tongue. He would literally call me something that directly translates to 'mother-f\*\*ker'"". I responded by saying that just because he was treated like that, does not mean he can treat me like that. He laughed it off.

When he says something inappropriate, I now respond on the spot with feedback. When we have 1:1's and I gave him feedback in the past, he rambled on for 25 minutes about something entirely irrelevant and did not address the feedback I gave him. When I asked him for feedback on me as an engineer, he said that he has no feedback for me. He is entirely new to being a manager and has absolutely no idea what he is doing, I understand that. But I am tired of it. Work is draining because I get constant negative feedback from him about small details of my projects that I missed and none of my work seems good enough for him. He is always demanding more or different results. He does not explain the ""why"" unless I ask or challenge him. It's a black and white difference from my original manager, who gave me constructive feedback and highlighted my successes for me.

I'm already seeking other jobs and teams within Tesla. When I initially told management this, my original manager asked me directly if it was because of Prasad. I did not want drama and I said it was because I want to be closer to family. But in reality, it was absolutely because of Prasad.

Switching jobs is a long process. Does anyone have any advice for me while I'm still stuck in this situation?

I  was wondering if anyone could help me. Currently I'm studying how to  meassure water flow in a river, i already know that there are serveral  methods to calculate it and in particular, **i'm a stuck with the one that is based on the conductivity (also known as dilution method or gulp dilution method)**.

There are several steps to do the procedure and get all the data, I'll try to explain it as simple as possible:

1. You  have to use a conductivity meter to read the conductivity of the water  (in this case the river), and temperature as well. I've never used one  of this so i don't know how to get good readings, since some equipments  ajust the conductivity automaticaly (due to the temperature) and others  don't.
2. Then, you have to make a solution using salt (table salt or NaCl) and pour into the river upstream.
3. Then  you have to take continuosly readings (downstream), and register the  changes in the conductivity until it gets back to normal.

Once you gather the data, you can plot it and analyze it. With this, you can calculate the flow using this ecuation:

Q= m\*k/A

Where  Q= flow in \[l/s\], m= mass of the salt in ¨¨\[mg\], A is the area of the  curve ¨\[microsiemens x seconds\] and \*\*k wich is the salt constant and is  dependent on the nature of salt and water temperature \[\*\*microsiemens  /mg/l\]

This is where i'm stuck, I  don't understand how ""k"" works. I mean, ""k"" is a factor that it is used  to adjust the conductivity that you are reading on the equipment (based  on the temperature). But i don't understand if apart from the  temperature, **it is affected by the equipment, i can look for it on tables** or **i should be getting the same value even if I use different equipments.**

First of all sorry if this is the wrong place to post but I figured I'd start here since there might be someone in this sub who went through a similar predicament.

**Background**

Graduated May 2020 with a BS in ME in NYC. Did some research during senior year but no internship experience. The hiring freeze was brutal and had to move from NYC to Chicago for a job starting in May/June. Job is in support engineering for a connector manufacturing company, so a lot of electrical engineering, not so much mechanical. However, the term the company uses for our department is technical support since we also deal with non-engineering related things as well like environmental inquiries, quality issues and also for example helping the sales and/or marketing team understand features for new/old connectors. This results in myself being an associate engineer and my full title being technical support associate engineer, where they usually remove engineer.

**Issues**

* Now I feel, when applying for jobs, my current job title is a bit of a let down. It looks like I'm a person that works in sales or customer service and not engineering
* Also, my current job is all things connectors so I apply a lot of newly learned electrical engineering/ connector knowledge (S-parameters, PCB design, etc.) and not so much mechanical. Finding correlations from the experience in my current job with the desired qualifications on for example an HVAC position is difficult. I have no specific type of job in mind, just want anything I can get my hands on to move back to NYC.
* Moving back to NYC so I can live with my parents to save rent money, and support them financially.  Doing an MS there would be cheaper since I am an NYC resident. 
* Still no interviews in my 20 applications so far starting December 2021.
* I feel if I don't move away from this company ASAP, I'll be stuck in the connector industry for good.

**Plausible Solutions**

* I understand that I need to increase the number of job applications (I've applied to 80 jobs to land the current one that I have) and polish my resume.
* I was thinking of starting an MS in NYC since it's daunting on me that I currently don't have the right experience for ME jobs in general. Regardless, starting an MS with no job lined up with hopes of obtaining one eventually sounds reckless.
* I applied to a few jobs in the East Coast last year and landed an interview with a company for a Field Application Engineer role, very similar to what I do currently. Unfortunately, during the interview I found out that the position is actually in Rochester, NY so I declined to proceed further.

I'm honestly very confused. I had this belief that I could land an interview a few applications in at least since now I have some experience but this is simply not the case. Also COVID which I understand but it surely isn't as bad as May 2020.

My native language is not english, so I might make some mistakes regarding how some things are called.

I got asked to calculate heat power of one plate heat exchanger. I have info of only one side, where sulfuric acid flows: vol. flow = 530 m3/h; Tin = 87,25 °C; Tout = 71,1 °C

My question regarding the calculation and units is following:

I've calculated mass flow: 530 m3/h \* 1800 kg/m3 / 3600 s/h = 265 kg/s

Using Q=m\*c\*dT, where c used is 1,588 kJ/kg/K

Q = 265 kg/s \* 1,588 kj/kg/K \* (87,25-71,1) °C = 6796,24 kJ/s

As I understand kJ/s = kW. And that should be the result, roughly 6,8 MW. However I was told my calculation is off by roughly 25% and it should be higher. And result should be in kWh. 6,8 MW would be 6,8\*3600 to get MWh, or not? But that would be off by a factor of few thousand.

I've looked over several books, googled (obviously with no good result) and found nothing that would give me result in kWh, which is mainly used for electrical energy, but not in the context I need it.

Could anyone give me any advice on my problem? Maybe some useful links where I could find more?

This is a repost which I originally asked in the [**r/IWantToLearn**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/) Since it might not get enough recognition by engineers there, I am asking it here.

So thing is I took up bachelor's in math instead of engineering given that, I loved maths and liked applying it in various fields say write blogs or coding and maybe design your own neural network. But unfortunately my college did not provide for Applied Maths and I am stuck with pure maths, but it works too as it has all the needed groundwork to get into some other field.

When I say I want to learn engineering I mean, some mixture of **Aerospace** and **Mechanical** engineering. I want to build rockets and rovers all together.

I looked up to all the college bachelor's undergraduate course structure to get a rough idea of how they make their students ready. Given that they teach them the necessary maths in the span of two years which we are already taught in only one year so I can manage that.

But they teach their students engineering drawings to fluid dynamics and I do not remember what more. But I can guess one thing that since I am trying to self study I might not need to follow a university's course structure point by point like maybe I can totally give up learning dimensional analysis for a quarter semester (only as example).

I am willing to give a long time just like engineering students since I am going to self study everything and with your help I want to make myself a year(s) course structure teaching me those. So I want you people to guide me how I can make this structure and with what resources?

I found this awesome website helping me with the [course structure.](https://www.aerostudents.com/) But on deep introspection it is not enough detailed on someone who is totally new/has a different background.

I found this [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/kbrnm/provisionary_list_of_aerospace_textbooks/) with full of important books. Now I want tips on how to test myself and stuff. Also I have given a thought to ask some professors/cold email various professors in linked in to maybe let me work with them as interns or something like that for the practical hands-on aspects of the study. I want opinion on, if this is a correct way to approach professors? What more/else can I do?

Given that I know all of the High School level Physics and Chemistry. How can I structure and learn this ""Rocket Science Engineering"". And what resources to follow particulary, like from what books to online courses and to the point youtube channels? (From basic CAD softwares to propulsion engines just like if NASA had made a 4 year curriculum course on it)

I’m 19 y/o from Az with a passion for mechanical engineering. I’ve always loved everything about cars; more specifically, how every part works together to serve a larger mechanical purpose (if that makes sense). My goal in high school was to go to ASU for my bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering in order to get into automotive engineering and design. I got my AS through a dual enrollment program in high school, so I graduated from a community college before I even got my diploma. Anyways, I graduated high school in May of 2020 - the worst possible time to graduate (because of our lovely friend Covid-19). I did end up going to ASU after all, but the entire semester was online, and very very difficult. I personally am not able to learn calculus, as well as 16 other credit hours in introduction to engineering courses, entirely online. I completed the full year, but did not pass all of my classes. I still have about 3 years left of school if I go back now, but I’m in a bit of a bind.

My question(s): 

I feel like the resources available now with social media and just the broad scope of the world wide web, that getting my degree may be more work and money than it’s worth. I don’t mean that to sound arrogant, I do understand that math is a very integral piece of engineering, as well as a lot of other aspects that university offers that I won’t have access to. I would be happy to go back to school and focus on math, especially since that’s always been the subject I’ve excelled at; I just don’t know if I have the time or money to go back for engineering. I know I want a career in automotive engineering/design involving the use of CAD and potentially CNC milling. I have some opportunities that I’m taking advantage of now that could lead me toward the career path I’m looking for, but I’m very limited to the people I know, and my current state of inexperience.

This is an unusual and challenging problem. But since math or reverse engineering are definitely not my strength, I am asking for your help, dear engineers and students. I am currently working as an operator on a new machine that no one knows at my job. I've looked everywhere on internet to find analysis, methods or procedures related to specific materials we use with this machine, but didn't find anything. After some time, I was able to get some working settings but it won't give me a constant precision since I don'T understand what are the maths behind my results. Sometimes I have to try 2 or 3 times in order to get the perfect thickness cut. But even if math is not my thing, I am curious and stubborn enough to go as far as I can in this journey So I thought, who better than... an engineer to help me figure out the perfect equation(s) for setting two values et get a precise cut on this wonderful machine.  

This machine is called a foam splitter (like that one: [https://ttarp.com/splitters/ttarp-light-duty-splitter-skiver/](https://ttarp.com/splitters/ttarp-light-duty-splitter-skiver/)). Basically, a foam sheet enters the machine, two pinch rollers with the right height and pressure move the sheet through the blade which is supported by the cutting guide (yellow part above the blade on the picture). I think I found all variables (but i have the intuition i am missing something related to the possibility of two or more pairs of values having the same result). I got an excel spreadsheet with data from cuts I made with the machine (link here: [https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/228ekk2mz4r58rqdmpxb8/Equation.xlsx?dl=0&amp;rlkey=9u296faz6oojxqrxgbjha5vjk](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/228ekk2mz4r58rqdmpxb8/Equation.xlsx?dl=0&amp;rlkey=9u296faz6oojxqrxgbjha5vjk)). I'm trying to find the equation that will give me the two values for setting upper and lower pinch roller height, only with the original thickness foam and the desired thickness foam to cut as known variables. 

Since I'm better with graphic design than with math, I made an image for basic understanding of the machine and to have a look at the variables I found. (Link of the image here: [https://i.postimg.cc/ZKJfYg1M/Splitter-equation.png](https://i.postimg.cc/ZKJfYg1M/Splitter-equation.png)

(IMAGE = First part of the picture is the mechanism: 2 handles control distance of 2 pinch rollers from the blade (with cutting guide in yellow). Second part of the picture with legend is about the variables I found (although not 100% sure about them). Third part of the picture is about the 2 types of cut, two first are regular cut, last one below is special cut where we only remove the surface.

Let's start with details that will definitely help you:

\- Original foam sheets (variable ""x"") come in multiple thickness, from 1/2 inch to 2 1/2 inches. 

\- Converted to the values on the handles, 1/2 inch is 500, 7/8 is 875, 1 inch is 1000, 2 inches is 2000, etc.

\- Minimum value of both pinch rollers is 75 and maximum (practical) value is 2000. 

\- Both pinch rollers need to compress the foam sheet to get a grip (variables ""c"" and ""d""). Which means that with a foam sheet of 1000 (1 inche), putting 500 on upper pinch roller and 500 on lower pinch roller won't work since there is no compression on any surface of the sheet foam (speadsheet contains 3 lines from experiments where there wasn't enough grip (Lines 6-10-15)). The data tells us that a minimum of 10% compression is needed. Too much compression (possibly above 20%) will skrink the thickness from one or two digits. 

\- This should not be required to find the equation since we know from the data that ideal pressure is between 10% and 20%, but it could also be useful to know that the foam sheets we use has soft-to-medium density, approx. 1.7 pound by cubic inch.  

\- The blade is the zero-point. Value of both handles represent the distance from the blade, up or down. 

\- (secondary information) The default cut is when the lower cut foam is the target cut (variable ""y"").  We sometimes do special cut, where we want to remove only a thin layer (called skin) on top of the foam sheet. Only in these few cases, the upper cut foam becomes the target cut (variable ""z"").   

&amp;#x200B;

Before setting the machine, the known values are:

1- variable ""y"" / target cut

2- variable ""x"" / original foam thickness

&amp;#x200B;

After using these values with the equation(s), it should gives: 

1- variable ""a"" / upper pinch roller height 

2- variable ""b"" / lower pinch roller height

&amp;#x200B;

\---Margin of error---

Because of the softness of the foam sheet, measurements are not extremely precise. Which means that measurements taken during experiments may have a difference up to 75 from the actual thickness. I wasn't sure if this was going to be a variable to put in the equation, but I guess that to find the correct equation with that margin of error will require to search for averages somewhere down the line. 

  

\---Experiments and Data / spreadsheet---

For the experiments, I've cut multiple foam sheets like this: 

1- I measure the original thickness of the foam sheet (""Orig. Thickness"" column in the spreadsheet). 

2- I try values on the Upper and Lower pinch rollers (""U handle"" and ""L handle""). 

3- I then measure Upper and Lower cut foams (""U cut foam"" and ""L foam Cut""). 

Then, I've also put some formulas in the spreadsheet to find: 

\- the gap (Gap column), which may represent the difference between original measurements and actual thickness.

\- pressure on Upper and Lower pinch roller (U pressure and L pressure) (which represents the difference between each pinch roller height and the thickness of each cut foam). 

\- % of pressure between Upper and Lower pinch rollers (% U pressure and % L pressure) 

\---

\- The two columns ""% U or L pressure"" can already tells us that the pressure will usually be greater on the lower pinch roller. The upper pinch roller need less pressure because of the cutting guide. If its main use is to support the blade tracking when the pinch rollers push the weight of the foam sheet through the blade, it also helps the upper pinch roller to have a better grip with the foam sheet.     

\- The lines with ""N"" and ""X"" means there wasn't enough compression for the foam sheet to go through. 

&amp;#x200B;

In case you can help me find the equation, I want to make it up to you. I have not much to give but i could do an exchange of services with you. I'm quite good with photoshop and Illustrator, I could certainly do touch-ups on your photos,or create a logo for you, or take your portrait or family portrait and turn it into a cartoon style picture or to set you in an unbelievable scene of your choice.

You don't even have to answer my question specifically, I find it helpful and even therapeutic to read other people's journeys and motivations through life.

Growing up, whenever people talk about the cool advancements in society (rockets, self-driving cars, smartphones, new materials), there's a common language used - ""Look what *they* did"", ""Who knows what *they'll* come up with next"" and so on. My life dream was to always be one of ""them"". To me, whether it was the Elon Musks or the person who decided what material the small part of the subsystem of the rocket was going to use was, I just wanted to have a peek behind the scenes and actually get a chance to contribute to the infinite amount of cool things that happen in society. That's basically been my consistent, core motivation.

I come from a very blue collar immigrant family with no connections and was good at school, especially math and science. I had no idea about career paths like being a consultant at McKinsey or what jobs like ""finance"" actually entailed, so engineering it was. I really liked variety and went with mechanical engineering. I graduated and hopped between some standard, run-of-the-mill engineering jobs, manufacturing environments, even environmental engineering. I didn't hit the 2 year mark at any of them, I was low-key kind of horrified that my job as an engineer was usually a glorified Excel monkey. I had some misgivings about my path. The final place paid for a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering, and as a last ditch I used it to get a job at a national lab.

I really like the national lab. It's the first place I feel like I'm a ""they"". I'm surrounded by absolutely driven people, and have learned advanced topics about everything from PCB design, to FPGAs, to finally having a good software background in Linux and various programming languages and networking interfaces, even machine learning. Before Covid I was traveling to international conferences and presenting alongside cool people. Last week a legit quantum physicist asked me for advice. I sometimes get chills (the good kind) when I think about the things I'm being tasked with. I recently got a competing job offer and my boss' boss shifted administrative rules to match the pay and give me a bonus, so I guess that's the best kind of feedback to know you're doing good. But still, I've felt stagnant now for a couple of years.

Part of me thinks that it's just my personality, that now I'm jealous of the people who get to work on VR headsets, but if I ever worked on VR headsets for a couple of years, I'll be jealous of the people who get to work on self-driving cars and then want to switch to that. And then within a couple of years be jealous of the people on the front lines of wearables like the Fitbit and then want to jump to that. Once you're in an industry, everything else is a mystery and it becomes something I wish I could see behind the curtain of.

Part of me also thinks that software engineering is clearly the most dynamic sector of engineering worldwide right now. The increases in salary and promotions are the quickest, the work is so obviously affecting society at a rapid rate. Personally, I've always been intimidated by trying to go into software. Whenever I'd take a class or go to a club or do a project, the people always seemed to be worlds ahead of me, talking about how over the weekend they were learning Rust to implement a home server that would use a CI/CD pipeline and open a ZeroMQ socket to make their Git Pull on the Linux Kernel. I always felt insecure, like these people have such a fundamental headstart on me that I'll never catch up. Although my job now has helped me feel more comfortable in this realm, I'm still not sure if I'd enjoy a software job at something mundane, so I have this bias to try to aim for the moon if I'm gonna go into pure software. I've made a version of my resume to apply for Python jobs at FAANGs and stuff, but I haven't had any bites yet.

Part of me feels like as I've grown up and become more worldly, I appreciate the ""management"" path more. I was one of those new grads who swore I'd never want to be a stuffy suit/manager and stick with actual design and math until the bitter end. But as I've grown in my career, I've kind of realized that the ""they""s are kind of more in the management and especially executive level people I used to dismiss. In a lot of ways, being the person who convinces the people with money to fund a project that will take the time of 10 engineers for the next few years and then follows through by assigning tasks to those engineers and steering development and reporting back, is a more powerful and cool position than being the hard worker who stays up all weekend to finish a design. That's definitely another way to be a ""they"" that I've come to envy more and more. Through my job, I've also come to enjoy taking that role on teams more and more - passing information to the right people, helping the workflow, making sure the request for quote is in or that there won't be any administrative hurdles for this task coming up next month.

However, I'm kind of unsure of how to go about that. I've made my intention to ""move up the ladder"" clear, and the bosses above me keep leading me on, but nothing tangible. Some people on this sub say to apply for a position at another company above your level. But can you really apply for ""Engineering Manager"" when you've only ever been an ""Engineer? I think I'd have to get a new job and make my intent for promotions clear from the beginning and press for it. Or I've been researching what it takes to get an MBA, as that looks like a good way to get to that level.

Part of me thinks that it's entrepreneurship that I really want. Obviously I would love most to be in the position of someone who starts an interesting company from scratch and gets to truly guide it. Or be someone who sells a company for 7+ figures and gets to not worry about the mortgage and have all day to either pursue funding for the next idea, or just crack open a laptop, hire a couple of people, and start working on it. To have that ultimate freedom that so many ""tech entrepreneurs"" end up having. I have been working on a side business that I hope to scale and sell one day for the past few years, on nights and weekends. It's a consumer electronics product, an idea I started by patenting just to see if I'd get it, and it grew from there. While it hasn't taken off (yet I hope), the process of seeking funding, making cold pitches to vendors who would carry it, dealing with manufacturers, on top of the pure design and coding - all of it was exhilarating, and really energized me. Part of it was held back that it was a nights and weekends project, and I'm wondering if I should just bite the bullet and go all in on a business, either this one or another idea.

Thanks for reading this far if you did. I hope I got my thought process across. Unlike many on this sub, I haven't burned out on engineering, but I do feel stagnant at the moment. All these thoughts are swirling in my head - continue job hopping to find novelty in engineering, switch to software engineering, switch to management, try entrepreneurship. All of them seem very cool at different moments of the day. Has anyone ever analyzed their potential future options like this? What did you end up doing? What did you like and what did you regret?

Hi everyone,

First - I'm not an engineer.

Is there a standard available, or best practice for creating part and product numbers that someone can point me to?

From  my time in aviation I'm familiar with AN and MS part numbering, and  some general best practices and drawing standards like avoiding  I, O,  Q, S, X, Z. Also using drawing numbers as the base for item part numbers  - but there were problems with identifying versions/revisions of the  actual part.

I want to use the  numbers to identify the physical products we make for manufacturing and  inventory purposes, as well as directly mark on some component parts to  identify our manufactured components and assemblies (including  individual parts cut from aluminum plate).

I have an opportunity to do this properly so any guidance is appreciated.

I'm a junior mechanical engineering student about to start a 12 month January internship for one of Canada's largest oilfield companies, as a facilities engineer with their in-situ oilsands operations. 

The background:

I grew up surrounded by engineers (both family and neighbours) working in the oilfield and a few in the metallurgical coal mining industry.  I'm immensely proud of their work and the role they played in building this industry into what it is in Western Canada, which is why I had hoped to follow in their footsteps and eagerly pursued internships within the industry. Something that had always appealed to me in their stories was the mix of field / office work they were often involved in, and it seems like my internship will offer up a similar mix. However, I can sense the ""writing on the wall"", so to speak, even just as a student and how hesitant my university is in promoting natural resource jobs. I am a pretty big believer that we will need O&amp;G to some extent for most of my life, but I am not oblivious (and neither are most Canadians) to the fact that the product produced by the industry, when burnt, is quite literally the cause of our changing climate. Public opinion in Canada is shifting rapidly and the industry has become a very hot-button topic. Folks here are eager to use the products that are derived (directly or indirectly) from petroleum, but a ""not in my backyard"" attitude towards extraction and production is something I increasingly sense is gaining traction. We must look to the future and embrace this challenge wholeheartedly, so as not to get left behind, but as for what that means for me as a lowly engineer I am not yet sure!

The question(s):

As I start this internship, are there specific skills that I should focus on learning while employed that will give me employability inside the industry while also maintaining my ability to ""pivot"" in the future? I know that coding is a big one and I've taken basic Python courses through school so I feel fairly competent in my skills there, although I know there are always new things to be learnt. 

As I complete my bachelors degree and become an EIT, would you avoid the oilfield altogether, or simply approach it with a cautious attitude? If so, how can I tailor my resume to highlight my skills developed as an intern while not looking like ""just another oil guy""? What other opportunities would you suggest? In terms of interests, the burgeoning tech sector, while broad, has yet to spike my attention in the way the oilfield has. I feel much more comfortable around the ""blue-collar crowd"", and would prefer opportunities in mining / manufacturing etc, although those can be hard to come by in Western Canada. It's one thing to say ""just find a job in renewables, obviously!!"" and something entirely different when you search Indeed in Alberta and find that 2/3 of mechanical engineer postings are oil/gas companies or EPC companies whose primary work consists of supporting aforementioned oil companies. 

If there are any Canadian engineers in this community, I'd be especially interested in hearing from you!

Long post, TLDR at bottom. also I don't post so frequent so forgive my formatting please..

I am graduate of 2021 with Bachelor of Electrical Engineering (Electronics Major). The job market in my country is not good. It is underpaid and highly competitive and there is corruption in selection process (need links etc.) and my CGPA is low (3.06) but I assure you that I am practical type of guy, good with concepts and problem solving and weak with theory.

Transcript Details

&gt; I have good grades in Microprocessors and Microcontrollers related subjects, good grade in Computer Networks, bad in Analog Electronics, Average in Digital Electronics, Good with concepts of Digital signal processing and Signal and Systems but bad in their mathematics (fourier/laplace etc.) You could say that I did bad where more theory was involved and did good where concepts were being used. examples are microcontrollers, CN on the good side while mathematical calculations of DSP, S&amp;S and Controls System on bad side while I have okay concepts of them.   
&gt;  
&gt; I am better than average student in programming and have done work in MATLAB, C, C++ while I am fimiliar with Verilog, Assembly. 

Now, I want to move out of here (my country) and go to somewhere with decent jobs and salaries. What I afford at the moment is to be an international student, go for Masters (choosing Germany because no tuition fee, I don't afford tuition fees anywhere else. ;-;), work hard, improve my CGPA to &gt; 3.8 in Masters and hopefully look for jobs there afterwards. 

What my question is that what field should I choose? MEng or MSc. I know MEng is for me if i want jobs but the problem with me is what if I am not satisfied in jobs and wanted to return to research style? I think a researcher has flexibility to re-locate to almost wherever he wants? I don't want to close my doors. also, I am very passionate to go into Automotive industry. On the other hand, a senior fellow is recommending me not to go into practical fields and go toward Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences.

Did the thrust-to-weight ratio of the entire system increase or was the increase in thrust offset by the added weight of the fans and the ducting and the turbines around the fans ? Basically would the ducting, fans and turbines end up making the entire system weigh more than triple what the engines themselves weighed ?

Hoping to get some clarity (or peace of mind) for the furniture layout of my circa 1900's home.

[Here is a diagram for reference.](https://imgur.com/a/vuFfiDp)

Our first floor is constructed with 2x8 joists, 24""OC which span approximately 14'. Given the age of the house, the joists are notched as either end of their attachment point. The basement area below the living room is finished, so I cannot see the condition of the joists in question. 

We have a large, heavy (approximately 350lb) sofa in our living room. The only place it fits in this room is near an exterior wall, parallel to the joists. I would estimate the width covers 2 joists in total. With 2 people (and our dog, of course), the total weight is probably 700 lbs when seated. 

There is a noticeable slope to the floor towards the exterior wall, which begins right where the sofa is placed. We recently moved in, so I don't know if this is recent, or if it's developed due to settlement &amp; 100 years of different sofas over the years, as it's where the prior owners had theirs for 25 years.

Assuming the slope is due to old settling, is there any reason for concern that this furniture placement could compromise our floors? I would have no concern if it was perpendicular to the joists, but the parallel placement has me a bit concerned, and questioning if I should look into alternate furniture arrangements.",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,258377.0,public,self,Question regarding floor load/weight capacity in old home,0.0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/rn0gsg/question_regarding_floor_loadweight_capacity_in/,all_ads,6.0,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'RoD2a211bW_TKLLMDu3oJeucCV2H_sjxLBbPGOK0A7o', 'resolutions': [{'height': 87, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0QStwlGUh8cOfDCiyWVVwILETXZak2Fyuxforwd0ESE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de14a35f115c9770cfcaabfeec660185156c78ea', 'width': 108}, {'height': 175, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0QStwlGUh8cOfDCiyWVVwILETXZak2Fyuxforwd0ESE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0d87f9d09b4a52702f6dbdfe1a8577dab340810', 'width': 216}, {'height': 259, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0QStwlGUh8cOfDCiyWVVwILETXZak2Fyuxforwd0ESE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d826e2d205d4b82ff155ec2eb3be659db668c9c', 'width': 320}, {'height': 519, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0QStwlGUh8cOfDCiyWVVwILETXZak2Fyuxforwd0ESE.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4013276665a1a2d0b563d2c6f5548a368c0fa72', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 691, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0QStwlGUh8cOfDCiyWVVwILETXZak2Fyuxforwd0ESE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=8e9b981420fdef382d041f6d5ff3c817c3dcfd75', 'width': 851}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They show what's the behavior of the system and what state is the system in. We listed out 4 working characteristics. Working speed, working intensity, capacity and effectiveness. 

Working speed is basically like speed V=S/t but you just replace S with the amount of products the system makes in a given time and t with the period that the system takes to produce 1 product. Working intensity is frequency, 1/t. 

Now the thing that I don't understand. Capacity is how many products can the system give in a given time. And there are things that influence capacity: characteristics of the technical system (which is a really weird way of saying, quality of the machines), the regime of the system (which is also easy to understand) but this one got me, capacity is influenced by conditions of use. And from that influence we have a branching of capacities. Capacity of potential, available, operating and effective character. And the effective character is the realest one. I mean other capacities are just used so u can get to the effective character. You start from the potential and you subtract time needed for repairs, holidays, vacations ... etc. And I tried to link those things together and I got that capacity is influenced by the use of effective capacity. I mean I found it oddly weird that you can use capacity. I mean you can't use it directly, it's not like a hammer, it's a statistic that can help you operate your system. And then I listened back to the lecture and the professor said capacity is influenced by the conditions of use of the technological system. Which still I don't get how that matters. 

So my question is what influences capacity of a system.

I am working on a small-scale thermal energy storage (TES) unit design to pair with a solar thermal collector. The energy will be stored in a simple reservoir similar to a molten salt tank system but on a much smaller scale. The thermal fluid I am working with currently is PetroCan Calflo AF.   


The solar trough(s) can heat the fluid to about 170C and I am trying to scale a TES unit to hold about 50kWh (thermal), to provide energy to a heat exchanger overnight. Since the thermal troughs will add no heat over night, I need to know how much energy the TES unit would have available as it cools. However, the heat capacity (Cp) of Calflo is about 2.35 (kJ/kgK) @ 170C and only around 2.0 at 100C.   


Most of the examples I am finding online use Q=mCp(delta)T with only one Cp value. Should I use the upper or lower Cp? Should I interpolate and use a Cp between the upper and lower values that I have for this fluid? Or is there some way to use a differential equation to account for the changing Cp over the range of temperatures that the TES unit would see during a night.   


Maybe I am overthinking this, but I have had this thought in the past regarding lots of thermo calcs that involve a changing temperature and a constant Cp.

If the RPM of the pump is same for both cases, then the motor's RPM is same for both cases as well? Then what contributes to the 90kg load difference? System pressure? You can adjust system pressure, but doesn’t that effect the volumetric flow then changing cylinder speed?

Let me preface with noting that my below words are meant NOT to be arrogant or boasting. I’m a pretty laid back, non-egotistical person so please do not take my words as such. I prefer clarity and I know from past interactions, my words can be construed as such. My apologies if that happens.

To start off…I am in my early 40’s and currently work FT as a very well compensated corporate aircraft technical manager, corporate jet pilot &amp; own 2 PT side businesses. I net roughly $350k annually with full benefits, PTO, etc. I’ve got 23+ years solid aviation skill set, my peers come to me quite often for help, I constantly receive accolades from manager/supervisor and never had to worry about a paycheck. I’ve worked very hard to be where I am. I’ve done this with only a HS diploma, 4 years USAF working aircraft and misc online courses coupled with never ending thirst for reading everything technical and love learning new things. It’s extraordinary that in the USA, my status was achievable without any formal higher education. 

With that said, my position/s are somewhat satisfying but my career moves now are fairly lateral as in there’s not much more I can achieve in the technical side of aviation. I could spend my life flying the atmosphere of earth in a biz jet but that excitement has wained with it becoming a “daily grind” feel to it. The composite of FT &amp; PT companies takes a tremendous amount of my time and I’m looking for a single job to replace all of them down the road in 10 years. I could make a job move but my feelings on it are not exciting. Sure, I’m paid well, own my own home, cars, have $$ in the bank, investments, yada yada but I guess I’m looking for something more. Something to get me excited to skip sleep and jump out of bed everyday like aviation used to. 

After my long winded blabbing, I’m getting to the point. I’ve always had a great respect for engineers/engineering and have pondered what if I went to college instead of the path I chose. I love everything space. Rockets, travel, spacecraft, satellite systems, you name it, it’s cool to me. 

Ive done some homework on the issue of going to college at 43 and have concerns with logistics of it as well which area to pursue. I’m hyper aware of the need for extensive mathematics skills and do “okay” with math but would need to essentially restart from algebra. My point is I’m not sure that I want to be a full-blown engineer in designing systems or widgets. I think from what I’ve seen I am rather interested in aerospace systems engineering. However, I can only find limited information on this area, estimated pay with experience and places to work. From what I’ve seen, it seems that “real engineers” laugh at system engineering because it’s more of a big picture job and not a roll up your sleeves and build something job. Is this true? I really would like input from this group. 

I’m not ready to make the leap yet but likely within 6 to 8 months I will do something. Just looking for help.

So what do you guys suggest?

Is there a widely available alloy that is highly permeable? Is pure iron the route to go? Would crudely annealing various steels with a furnace or blow torch have a positive impact?

I understand that this may be outside of the norm for questions here - but I wanted to ask / solicit advice here first before I reach back out (and pay a bit of money) to the Engineering company I used for this.

I essentially live in a raised ranch. [Here is a layout of the house](https://i.imgur.com/H9Hwusj.png), the outside measurements are pretty accurate but the inner rooms are just guesstimates

A few months ago I hired an engineering company to come up with a beam design to remove a section of a load wall. The load wall is the wall that the green arrow [here](https://i.imgur.com/YQPJ67E.png) is pointing too. That whole run of wall in the house carries a load up until it makes the 90 degree turn south. [This is their design without my arrows](https://i.imgur.com/DlshmM0.png) that would remove a portion of the load wall via LVL beams, eventually distributing the load onto the foundation versus directly onto the floor and joist below. The reason I chased this design is due to the original house design essentially having all that load just end at the 90 - because the rest switched to (2) 2x10 beams, which caused a low spot in the ceiling, subfloor, as well as some curling on the single joist below.

The design I paid for is great. I am not doing the work myself but I want to make sure I am happy with what I am going to pay for, which is why I am here. 

[This here](https://i.imgur.com/qpUhA6A.png) is the current layout of that section of wall that I drew up to the best of my ability - starting at the bathroom door and going west (compared to [this layout](https://i.imgur.com/H9Hwusj.png)). You can see that this section of wall sits about 15' on center at a 30' run N/S for the majority of the house until the garage sets it back 10', where the living room spans only 20' N/S and why they transitioned to a beam. I understand it may not be 100% accurate in regards to stud and joist placement, but I tried to get it as close as possible - it is drawn in a 1:24 scale.

To the best of my ability, I drew up [the engineered design](https://i.imgur.com/RjxqKO8.png) for that section of wall to visually see how it would look - where red beams, studs, and cement are the new ones. I am 100% okay with the design as that is what I agreed to.

I was just a bit curious if it was possible to take it a step further and request [they design something like this](https://i.imgur.com/3TCfIWB.png) to avoid adding another beam spot in the basement versus keeping them somewhat grouped - or if I would be 'reaching' at that point. I wanted to ask of what others here thought before I drop some more money a beam design that they will happily oblige to make if possible, but it be too much of a headache or cost for me to even consider.

I'm currently interviewing with two companies for a new position. After casually looking/interviewing all year I've finally found two companies I would like to work for. I've decided that (assuming I get offers), I must to take one of the two, staying at my current job is not an option.

&amp;nbsp; 

I have finished all the scheduled interviews for both companies, including the final interview(s). However with both there is a possibility they could schedule additional follow up interviews/calls/emails, but I'm not aware of either of them planning to do so. 

&amp;nbsp;

The company I finished interviewing with first (Company A), which is the one I would prefer to work for, I felt the interviews went really well. 4/5 of the team members I had individual interviews with essentially explicitly told me they want me on their team, the 5th was a little more vague though I think he wasn't actually member of the team. I reached out to the hiring manager last Friday and he said to reach out him again within a week if I haven't heard from anybody by then. I still haven't heard anything. 

&amp;nbsp;

Both companies are fairly similar. They have similar (good) benefits. One big reason I like company A more is its a lot closer to my house. Company A's recruiter initially told me pay range is	""106k-140k maybe could be more, with a profit sharing bonus"". 

&amp;nbsp;

Company's B recruiter reached out to me yesterday to ask about salary expectations ahead of an offer. I'm supposed to get back to him today. He initially told me ""In general we are in the $130K - $170K +10% bonus range, but there is always flexibility for the right candidates."" However yesterday he said based on my experience they feel the level I would be hired at would be in the 110k-120k range with a 10% annual bonus. 

&amp;nbsp;

How should I respond to him about what I expect for a salary? I obviously want to maximize my income. Salary.com gave a 132k median salary for an Electrical Engineer Level 3 in my area. I would really be happy with 140k but I honestly don't know that my experience warrants that salary. Can anybody advise me on next steps? I'm an Electrical Engineer with 6 years experience in Silicon Valley. However tbh I'm not the best engineer. My current job has not given me the experience I was led to believe I would get.

***​​Yes, I know what I'm asking.​​***

Before you start hurling tomatoes at me, screaming ""you can't violate the first law of thermodynamics!"", like a ton of people do on the internet when they see this topic — this is a s​​erious discussion delving into the potential of flywheels and how it can be used for carbon-free, efficient and resilient power systems.

We all know that science is an ever-changing field of information and knowledge. It's constantly evolving. Things that were thought impossible 20 years ago are now commonplace. Science is all about hypothesis and experimentation. As Herbert Spencer espoused:

&gt;""There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all argument and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance. This principle is **contempt prior to examination**.""

I came here to this community hoping to have a **civilised, rational and productive discussion** with you folks, so I sincerely ask that this conversation doesn't turn into a gladiator ring of insults and stupid comments like other people on the internet.

# Background

If you're unfamiliar with this topic, here's a brief description.

There are many videos on YouTube that talk about ""free energy generators"". Before you watch these videos, **please set aside your biases, prejudices and your presuppositions.** These people may be of a different culture, a different background from you. They aren't uneducated and they aren't simpletons. And that doesn't give anyone the right to discriminate them or condemn their efforts. These are people trying to live their lives exploring new opportunities, given the circumstances they are under.

Here are some links to the several videos showing this setup.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlmESUNVvBM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlmESUNVvBM&amp;t=191s)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tITpsOUcs\_I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tITpsOUcs_I&amp;t=103s)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzk1VPJNg6Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzk1VPJNg6Y&amp;t=2s)

Most of them comprise of the following items.

1. A flywheel (typically 100 kg)
2. An electric AC motor (typically 3 HP)
3. An AC synchronous alternator (typically 12.8 kW, 1500 RPM)
4. Some timing belts and pulleys to allow the flywheel, motor and alternator to revolve together
5. A metal frame to mount these items on

They show a demonstration of how it works. First, the motor is powered by a source like your regular home AC outlet. The motor activates the system, so the motor, flywheel and alternator start turning together. The alternator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, and that energy can be accessed by a multi-outlet extension cord.

After sufficient time of running the system, the motor is unplugged from the original source and then is quickly plugged into that extension cord. This creates a closed loop. We see in the video that the system is still running, functioning perfectly well.

They then demonstrate that it is producing energy. They add loads such as welding machines, electric saws, light bulbs and a variety of other items that draw power. Then the video usually ends here.

In short, the system seems to be able to run continuously for an indefinite period of time until one of the components wear out or break down. This seems to create a ""virtually endless"" supply of energy.

# Examination

Here's where the controversy starts. People would say, ""It just doesn't work. Trust me!"", or ""This is fake, don't waste your time!"", and the more literate people would exclaim, ""You can't create or destroy energy! It's simply converted into different forms!""

Yes, of course energy can't be created, literally only God can do that. Only a fool would disagree with the first law of thermodynamics. I just don't understand why people like to condemn others without pointing out improvements, suggestions, etc. Anyway, here's what I think.

Step 1: The motor receives electrical energy and converts it into mechanical energy.

Step 2: The mechanical energy from the motor is transferred to the flywheel via the pulley and belt.

Step 3: The flywheel's rotation transfers mechanical energy to the alternator.

Step 4: The alternator receives mechanical energy and - through electromagnetic induction - converts it into electrical energy, which is used to power the electric motor itself (and other loads, like the power tools).

# Inquiries

Now, I have some questions about this setup. Maybe you share the same questions.

1. What is the function of the flywheel in this setup? It seems like you can do this even without the flywheel. There are videos showing a similar setup but without a flywheel. [Here's the video.](https://youtu.be/fSFCsheDF1I) And [here's another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGkW6w-tl7w) showing a coupler being used.
2. The rotation of the flywheel will multiply the rotating speed of a pulley or wheel that is smaller in diameter. Doesn't this contribute to greater RPM, leading to more energy generated by the alternator?
3. There are magnets in the alternator. Can they be deemed as a source of energy, since their magnetism is converted into electrical energy?

# Conclusion

That's the long and short of it. I hope this post would spark some discussions about the capabilities of the flywheel, especially in terms of generating power in this fashion. I am most open to improvements, suggestions, critiques, questions, advice, and any kind of constructive response. Thank you all.

I even took the professional engineering licensure test (study materials costed several thousands) and passed, but my license doesn't come in until January. Even then, I'm probably looking at being closer to 75K once it comes in.

I'm currently interviewing with two companies for a new position. After casually looking/interviewing all year I've finally found two companies I would like to work for. I've decided that (assuming I get offers), I must to take one of the two, staying at my current job is not an option. 

&amp;nbsp;

Based on how the interviews went I'm pretty confident at least one of the companies will give me an offer, if not both. The company I expect an offer from is the company I'd rather work for. However I am trying to continually remind myself that I do not have a new job until I have a start date. 

&amp;nbsp;

So far after finishing all my interviews, all I have done is reached out asking for a timeframe of when I should expect to hear back regarding the next steps in the interview process, or on a decision. The hiring manager of one company told me to reach out to him again if I haven't heard back in a week. In my email to him I also thanked him and the other interviewers for their time, etc. In regards to the other company I got in touch with the recruiter who said he's going to talk to the hiring manager tomorrow and then update me with more information. With each company I had one-on-one zoom interviews with around 5 people. I do not have their individual contact information to thank them or speak to them further individually. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have finished all the scheduled interviews for both companies, including the final interview(s). However with both there is a possibility they could schedule additional follow up interviews/calls/emails, but I'm not aware of either of them planning to do so. I just want to make it clear that that is a possibility. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, I'm wondering, what should I have done/be doing after having finished the final interviews? It sucks to wait to hear back for a response so it feels like I should be doing something. What, if anything, can I do in the meantime that would increase my chances of getting a job offer?

I have a tree in mind that could work, but I want to make absolute certain that it is safe. Im going to take a look and make measurements tomorrow but I figured I should start by collecting all of the codes and formulas Im going to need. I tried googling ""treehouse deign codes"" and similar but couldnt come up with anything useful or more advanced than general advice for your average layperson so now Im turning to everyone here. Hopefully you have more advanced information that I can use.

Here is what I have so far:

**Assumptions:**

* There will be an absolute maximum of 500lbs of people (so two adults plus my niece at once with some simple furniture)
* Factor of safety is 1.1 (so 10% over the bare minimum)
* 6ft off the ground

**Features**

* 3ft high railing
* Gate that latches on the outside of the railing
* small hut with metal roofing and small windows that is directly attached to the tree where possible
* Side deck to sit outside
* Ladder

**Materials I have access to**

I'd prefer to use materials I already have access to so here is a quick list

* several dozen pressure treated 2x4s
* Several dozen pressure treated 2x6's
* Several dozen pressure treated 2x8s
* Old roofing tin
* 4 inch decking screws
* 8 and 10ft long kerosene soaked railroad ties (probably used to support the deck and any additional supports)
* Old, weathered wood and scrap lumber from before I was even born (probably use this as siding)

**Some of the advice I saw**

* Branches that are 8 inches in diameter minimum (or 25.13 inches in circumfrence)
* The tree should still be alive
* I should use a minimum of 1""-1.25"" lag bolts

I figure that I am going to need the equations for a cantilever beam (to determine bending and shear force) as well as the equations related to column loading and buckling.

I am new to chemkin, however I ran some sample mehcanisms such as the GRI-3.0 and a 17 species skeletal mechanism for combustion of methane+hydrogen mixture. The results came out correct. But now I want to run the methane+hydrogen case using a 19 species reduced mechanism ([http://spark.engr.uconn.edu/mechs/inst\_pro.htm](http://spark.engr.uconn.edu/mechs/inst_pro.htm)). I compiled chemkin as per the given instruction for a 1D freely propogating premixed case. But now I get error while running the case. Even the GRI-3.0 case which used to run earlier is giving the same error output.

I couldn't find the output file for the reduced mechanism case. So I'm attaching the input and log file for reference.

I get covid is still going on but 95% of the employees refuses to even come into the office and every day I still in the office alone with max 1 or 2 other people (who I don’t work with). As a new grad/employee, I find it important to go into the office. The company has no culture at all, top managers never even come into the office, no activities, etc. I appreciatethe company still letting me bill hours for never having work to do, but I honestly haven’t learned anything and I feel as if I’m actually losing any knowledge I once had. I have friends I graduated with who are working for great companies with great cultures and benefits and gaining so muchc valuable experience and it honestly makes me a little sad.  I’ve also been noticing small red flags with the company when it comes to money. 

I just feel as if I’m wasting my time on a company / position that hindering my learning experience and providing me no satisfaction. I dread every day and it’s causing me to care even less about the work. I know it’s only been 5 months and everyone says I should stick it out for a year but I just don’t understand the point if I’m gaining nothing. I’m 22 and I feel as if this is the time I have the chance to move / switch jobs.

I’m just nervous the fact that I only would be at this job for 1/2 year and how that may look to prospective employers. I don’t plan on being a job hopper but this job  just isn’t for me.

I’m working on creating a cold storage box (personal project) based on thermoelectric cooling (TEC), using a Peltier module.
 
Unfortunately, I haven’t had much success in getting this to work and completely hit a dead end. For reference, I’m using the following setup:
 
Small rectangle enclosure (approximate volume of 2 litres and dimensions 160 x 220 x 220 mm)
 
Peltier Modules : I’ve tried both TEC1-12706 and TEC1-12708 (40mmx40mm).
 
The box has a small cavity in the middle for incorporating the Peltier/heat sink and fans arrangement.
 
These are the rough visuals of my setup (please ignore the horrible fans design, just wanted to give you an idea of the arrangement).
 
[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3EEMrSW.jpg?1)

[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/H9YBseD.jpg)

I’ve made a small cavity in the box (to the size of Peltiers). I placed the Peltier module in this hole with the cold side inside the enclosure and the hot side outside the box( both isolated from each other).

The items used in my setup:

Cold Side:
 
I attached a 40mm x 40mm aluminum heat sink to the cold side of Peltier (applied thermal compound to bond them). I placed the DC 12V cooling fan (40 mm x 40mm) on this heat sink.
 
Hot Side:
 
I placed a large aluminum heat sink (120x100mm with fins) on the hot side (just outside the cavity). I pasted the Peltier hot side on this heat sink surface. Then, I added a large DC 12V fan (90mmx90mm) on top of the heat sink to dissipate the heat.
 
I'm using a DC Power Supply to power my Peltier device. I connected all wires in parallel (positives together and negatives together). Upon running the operation, my Peltier module generates 4-5Amps of current at 12V, but there is hardly any cooling of my enclosure. A few observations from my numerous tests:
 
- The ambient temperature is 25 C for my case.
 
- I measured the temperature at the immediate area of the Peltier and cold heat sink, and the lowest I could reach was 11 C. But the worst thing is that the surrounding enclosure literally has no cooling at all. When I place the temperature probe in the compartment, not near the Peltier, the temperature increases to 20 C (almost the same as ambient).
 
I'm very much a beginner with Peltier modules and electronics, so I've looked at several resources/discussions online, but no luck.
 
I'm just confused about how several YouTube videos on Peltier devices demonstrate people achieving temperatures ranging from -5C to 4C with the most basic setup. Some have essentially used commercially available Peltier kits, while others have used the most basic heat sinks/fans and achieved good performance ( zero degree temperatures)

For example,

[This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlUabY6Bq6E)

[Another basic setup](https://youtu.be/4X123rMAJuM)

I’ve been using the same setup as in their videos, and I’ve run tests with several modules, high-speed fans, and various heat sink sizes. But I can't have any luck in getting my Peltier setup to work.

I just wanted to make sure I understand the difference between the power and RF power of a transmitter (or transceiver etc).

When looking at a data sheet, my assumption is that ""power"" refers to the DC power required to run the device (i.e. how much power needs to be supplied to it from the EPS), and ""RF power"" is the maximum RF signal it can generate and send to an antenna?

For example, I'm looking at an S-band transmitter that has a ""power"" of 5W, and an ""RF power"" of 1W.

So, as I understand it, this means the transmitter needs to be supplied with 5W of power, and can output a maximum signal of 1W?

Follow-up question: let's say I then attach an antenna with a max RF power of 2W. This would mean that the max RF signal it can be supplied by a transmitter is 2W? But because my transmitter can only output 1W, it will only receive 1W?

Final question: Keeping with this example, my comms system's total power would just be the power of the transmitter, right? The antenna doesn't have its own power requirement? It just takes an RF signal and sends it to Earth?

Please correct me if I'm doing my math wrong, but the 9000mah battery with a 120C rating would be capable of producing 9A \* 120C = 1080A continuous, albeit it for only 30 seconds. This is considerably more than an XT90's continuous rated current of 90 amps even for a 30s time period. 

Given that I had several questions:

1. What drives the limit on a connector's amperage? Is it just that the contact conductors and contact resistance have a resistance large enough that things would start to melt? Is the 90A limit on an XT90 connector an extremely conservative value or a reasonable limit?
2. What would happen if you actually tried to discharge one of these batteries in 30 seconds at 120C (or faster, the website implies that it can handle 240C temporarily)? Could it even discharge that fast given the internal resistance of the battery and wires?
3. If these batteries cannot actually discharge that fast, are the 'C' ratings on this battery (and similar ones) just lies? 
4. Could this create a potentially very unsafe situation if someone tried to draw an unsafe amount of current from one of these batteries?

Side note

I posted a question about this on /r/rccars but didn't really get the answer I was looking for. I understand that the battery will only supply as many amps as the load requires, but I'm asking what happens if the load does actually demand that much current. I am also not asking what happens if you draw 300A once in a while, the battery is clearly advertised as 120C *continuous*.

This has gotten me a bit confused about g forces, and I don’t recall anything like this ever coming up in university. When the object is at rest, it is experiencing 1 g of course. But from a practical, nominal standpoint in my little simulation, the acceleration of the object is zero. 

So let’s say the actuators pull the object down at 50 m/s^2. Is it truly experiencing 5.10 g’s (50 / 9.81 = 5.10) or does the acceleration due to gravity “add on” to that and it’s actually experiencing more?

So my utility says I consume ~10,000 kWh a year.   Dividing that by 12, gives me 833.4 kWh a month in a naive/perfect world.   Divide that again by 30 days, gives me 27.78 kWh.

NREL says I get on average 5.5 solar hours per day (it spikes nearly to 7 in the summer but lows in the 4's in winter).

I thought that if I divide that average day 27.78 kWh by my solar hours (5.5), I get 5.051 or what I assumed should be an ideal 5 Kilowatt array.

Am I not understanding kWH's, solar hours, or the translation from kWh to KW?

Fundamentally I don't feel like this is specifically a question about solar because the source of energy could be swapped for a small VWT/HWT, a creek hydroelectric turbine, or some other source of residential energy source (eg a cat with a butter side up slice of toast strapped to its back in a generator \s).

The reason I say I almost received it is because my boss refused to release me by a certain time, and the other hiring manager wanted my to start earlier. I have lost the offer because of this.

I have a tiny camera with LED light that is connected to a PCB and HDMI port (female end) via a cable ribbon (see pic). I did not make this camera/LED combo that is connected to the HDMI port so unfortunately I don't have too many details but it looks like a somewhat simple design. It is designed to \*somehow\* be both powered by a cable with a male-end-HDMI, and return video via the same HDMI cable (maybe it is not just a simple HDMI cable?). In the original design, a proprietary monitor with attached cable with male-end-HDMI connector, would be hooked up to this HDMI port and turn the camera and LED light on, and then display the video on the monitor. I am looking for a small portable monitor with a cable with male-end-hdmi that can hook up to this camera/LED on PCB, and display the video.

Unfortunately, hooking up a regular HDMI cable from a monitor, doesn't turn the camera on or transmit any video. I've tried a few cables.

I realize that it is hard to describe in words what I'm talking about, so hopefully the pics can clarify, but nonetheless, here is a list of what I'm looking for:

What I have:

\- PCB with HDMI port with camera/LED combo attached via a cable ribbon.

It's less design and more validation that the edge stresses are comfortably below limits before I start bending the next batch.  


I'm currently taking the R, the radius of curvature along the beam, as equal to the radius of curvature  of the sheet IN THE Y AXIS at the point. This seems to me to be needed as y, I and the location of the NA are all calculated along this axis. But I know I'm stepping a long way from the simple beam case, and the R is not equal across the cross section, let alone along the part. There's the average section curvature and the local spot curvature, both contribute to local stress. If it was a normal PFC under bending, there'd only be the average sectional curvature. It feels like there's a bit more going on here. thoughts.

So, I got my BSME 20+ years ago and I've been working pretty much non-stop ever since. I did get laid off for a year in 2008/9, but that's about it. While I was laid off, I finished my MSME as well.  I've had 8 different employers in a variety of industries. I used to love my work. I used to get paid to design things, make parts, build and tinker with prototypes using my hands, test things, break them then redesign and build them better. Do engineers still do that? 

My current employer used to have a small machine shop with a mill, a lathe and some other power tools. That's gone now (they said it was a liability) and any of that kind of work, we have to send out, which costs more and takes longer. Over the last 5 years or so, my job has turned into a customer-facing role, which I didn't mind at first, but it's really just dumbing down and explaining complicated data to our customer's management using Excel and Power Point and updating project schedules in Project. There's no real challenge in that, I'm not really doing any engineering work, I'm not solving any problems, just checking off boxes on a list and making sure the project is on track. It was great during COVID shutdown and I could work from home and even have the occasional breakfast Scotch to make it through the morning huddle, but now, my boss wants to see everyone back in the office...because.

It pays pretty well, I'm pretty sure that I've topped out compensations without moving into management. I live in the Upper Midwest USA. The city I'm in has a pretty low COL even for the region, but I'm bored. I've developed insomnia and I'm constantly filled with anxiety that I'm about to get fired, despite consistently good performance reviews, praises from my customers and no negative feedback from my boss whatsoever. 

Some of the ideas I've considered:

* **Patent Bar -&gt; Law School -&gt; Patent Law** \- While this wouldn't mean making more stuff, it would be completely different and would likely mean an increase in compensation over the long term. 
* **Law School -&gt; Product liability law**. I've always felt that those who put dangerous designs on the market too often get away with it. (I took the LSAT a few years ago and did very well.
* **Return for my PhD in ME** \- I'm not sure why I'd do this other than I liked school a lot and always did well. I'd be a new professor my late 50's.
* **Get my PE and start doing design/consulting on the side -** I'm not sure how my current employer would feel about me moonlighting. 
* **Go teach High School -** While I occasionally dream about being an awesome science teacher, using my engineering superpowers to teach and inspire, I know the likelihood is that I might have one class of students that are actually interested in sciences and 5 other classes that could not care less. Add to that pedantic administrators, parents that think science is a myth and politicians who demonize teachers as greedy and it's a ""No""
* **Quit -&gt; Sell everything -&gt; Join the Peace Corps -** While it sounds nice to just chuck it all and fuck off across the globe, I'm pretty sure I'd wind up someplace terrible. I've gotten soft and I like my creature comforts. 
* **Quit -&gt; Trade School /Apprentice** \- I'd be starting a career all over...

I recently got my EIT certification and I want to pursue my P.E. license. Current issue is that my current employer doesn’t have any P.E.’s that can supervise me so I really don’t have no choice but to start looking for another career opportunity.

Now comes my dilemma…I’m a 24 year old EE and I don’t really view myself as very bright. Mostly because all my coworkers are 30+ years old and have 8+ years of experience and all the external engineers I deal with are much older, so I don’t know how to gauge myself in comparison to EE engineers my age in the same field. According to my ex-lead engineer and my current director I have picked up the concepts, theory, and overall knowledge of the work my company does much faster than previous engineers. They’ve even bragged that I have performed better than past senior engineers. Obviously, there’s still a lot regarding HV control theory that I still don’t know but they insist that just naturally comes with experience. So although I only have 2.5 years of actual experience in the field they have made it clear that my performance is that of a mid-level engineer who has been in the industry for 5+ years.

Now I’m looking into other jobs and I see a few positions for Protection &amp; Control Engineers but they require (preferred qualifications) 5+ years of experience in Protection &amp; Controls Engineering. I don’t have no where near 5 years of actual experience nor do I have any experience with protection schemes nor working with any protection relays. I’ve spoken to my ex-lead engineer and he has encouraged me to apply regardless. He praises my adaptability and willingness to learn as a reason alone of why I should not be bothered by some of these crazy requirements. If I was able to pick up HV control schemes, I am more than capable of learning protection schemes. If provided with the right resources and a good mentor I’m sure I can learn any new concepts.

I’ve seen some other positions but they are considered Entry Level. I’m currently making 81K. Obviously I’m not trying to take a pay cut and I’m hoping to get bumped to 90-95K in my next role. I highly doubt that an entry level position would offer such a high pay and I don’t know if recruiters would toss my application away if they see me applying for positions requiring 5+ years of experience and I only have 2.5 years of relevant HV experience.

I know this is a lot to read, but I would appreciate any input or advice on the matter. I just want to make sure I’m not selling myself short in our current job market.

First of all let me excuse myself if this question is too general, or wrong subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm making a waste oil burner. The main use is to get rid of my waste oil, second use will be heating the workshop.

I ordered a siphon nozzle with a 2.0mm opening. similar to the one in the link below.

The oil i use is old engine-oil, mixed but mostly synthetic 5w30 or similar.

I can't get the flame to burn, i use an propane torch to (try) ignite it. So after reading and watching countless youtube videos i decided i need a combustion chamber.

So i made a 100x100mm box with openings of  50mm total lenght 300mm

It ignited once, but can't get it to keep burning.

Air pressure; tried everything from 10 to 40 psi.

I don't need high efficiency, main use will be to get rid of the waste oil.

Once it is functioning correct, i will make a furnace or heat exchanger to heat the workshop.

First of all, if this isn't okay to post here then please point me in the right direction of a sub that might be able to help!

I have an assignment at uni based around choosing a comms system for a lunar orbiter and I was hoping for some guidance.

The relevant mission requirements are:

• The orbiter payload (LIDAR) will image the poles and take 19.2GB of data per orbit that must be transmitted back to the relay satellite in orbit around earth.
• It must use an S-band downlink at 8 Mbps to the relay satellite. This is only for payload data, housekeeping data will be handled by a separate full-duplex channel.
• Max satellite size is 27U.
• There are no mass, cost or power requirements.

By my calculations, this would require around 5.3hrs of transmit time per orbit. We are free to choose our own orbit, but from what I've seen, most lunar orbits are only around 2hrs. So how can I transfer 19.2GB of data per orbit if it'll take over 5 hours!?

Taxes are high and they don't value engineers much at all in Belgium, so I know my salary will be cut in half (and my take-home pay cut by 2/3, while the price of houses is double, but that's an external Belgium government issue) compared to my cushy defense contractor job in the US. I am not looking to get rich, but I am not looking to be ripped off.

I have a choice betweeen Company A and Company B. Company A is a start-up style company (only a decade or so old and around 50-100 people) and company B is a very big company.

**Company A offer**

- 2600 EUR per month net salary (31200 EUR per year for civilized countries /s) Take-home would likely be 1900-ish per month. 

(*Note:* this is what my girlfriend makes who does student management at a school at 0 experience, where I have a few years of experience in signal integrity as well as hardware design engineering. In America, this would be a completely insulting offer)

- Company car/ travel compensation

- 32 Vacation days 

- End of year bonus (no amount specified in writing, but they said that I could contribute some of this to a pension fund to not get as taxed on it)

- 125 EUR per month for food

**Company A Impression**

It seems like a very young, very social company where people all know each other, get along, and are friends. I desperately would like that as my last job in america was much more isolated, I was one of the only young people, and only a few people went out for drinks once every month or two and I would only call 1 person in the whole company a ""work friend"".

It would be a ton of design work, a ton of testing work, and pretty much getting a huge breadth of experience. The work seems much more fun. They get to work on whatever consumer, industry, or medical products they find feasible, so they do a huge variety of design work in mechatronics, electronics, sensor tech, etc... It seems like a much more fun place to work.

**Company B offer**

- 3400 EUR per month (40800 EUR per year) take-home would likely be 2200 per month

- Bike lease comes partially off salary

- 32 vacation days

- End of year bonus (1 month pay + 92% of one month pay for vacation bonus)

- 150 EUR per month food

- 5% per year pension fund contribution on top of salary

- 20 EUR per month internet compensation

- Some small starting bonuses

**Company B Impression**

They are a much larger company. The team is much older and didn't seem as social. Much closer to my last job. I would have to work hard and make friends outside of work I think. The team is literally only 4 people (including the manager) and I would likely be alone in the lab many times. 

I would be doing 75% lab work and 25% software automation work. It would be mostly tech work in testing very high-tech silicon optical chips and such. Test design would probably come into effect. Very different work, and much more focused and tech-ish work. They may sponsor me to go back to school if I pursue silicon photoinics-related degrees. 

**Negotiating counter offers**

I have never had 2 offers simultaneously. During graduation in the states, I would just get offer after offer and worry more about whether I found the work intriguing and the compensation good.  Now, I have the opportunity to counter-offer. I got Company A's offer less than a week ago and Company B's offer today.

I *think* I would like working at Company A more, but there is such a big difference in the offers, I don't even know how to begin with a counter-offer.

Should I ask for some in-between salary that would be a reasonable improvement? Something like a 10%-20% additional counter-offer to Company A? Should I try to get contribution to a pension fund in addition to salary like at company B? I am completely lost, and I need to communicate to company A today.  Also, offers were communicated to me via email then calling for explanation + Q&amp;A. Should I counter-offer via email?

Now I was told that in order for the last gear to turn, the first one would have to eventually travel faster then the speed of light, which based on our current understanding of physics isn’t possible. However does it have to turn this fast in order to beat the end of the universe or does it have to turn that fast to get the last gear to turn at all?

Or framed in another way, if we lived in another universe where time was actually infinite, could you turn the first gear at a moderate rate, during which the materials of the gear would hold up indefinitely (yes I understand this also isn’t really possible but hear me out) and eventually get the last gear to turn however many 1x10 (however many zeros) later? Which gets back to my original question, is the rate of the first gear turning important in order to eventually get the last gear to complete one full revolution (regardless of how slow that revolution eventually happen)?

I also end up receiving an email version of the same positions, asking me to apply even though the requirements are completely different than where I should be (such as high school GED, Associate's degree, or 1 year lab experience).

&amp;#x200B;

As the title says I'm an EE in my mid 30's. I've been working at a place for close to 10 years. Pay isn't great, but the place is pretty laid back. I'm practically a manager but not really which is also a pro and a con. I've recently gotten motivated to really get my career moving (pay, I'm tired of living in the middle of nowhere, parents health isn't great and trying to get closer) but I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out the next step. I'd call myself a really good generalist; code, analog, digital, mechanical, and general product development. Also related areas like networking and IT (sysadmin type stuff).

&amp;#x200B;

I just started seriously searching but I'm not sure what I want to do. The one thing that keeps coming up is getting back into robotics/mechatronics/drone type stuff but pretty much everything I look at wants years of ML/AI. Another thing is more electronic widget design but that seems to be a funny area. Its either small companies that seem to be in the $50-70k/yr (in Austin!) or big companies that want you to be really specialized in something that I can't realistically get in my current position (like 5-10 years in FPGA's relating to HD video streams is the last one I saw).

&amp;#x200B;

So all that being said, I'm just looking for some advice. I'm looking for &gt; $100k/yr position in some place like San Antonio or 120k-ish in Austin. Am I mis-calibrated (for a generalist)? Is this kind of pay only going to be for specialized positions? Also, I could take some online courses for say ML but that's just going to put me in a entry level position. It feels like there should be a better way to make a lateral transition.

First of all, sorry for the long post. It might have a simple answer but my engineering field is not related to thermodynamics so I am a bit lost, and Google has not given me a decent answer ;-)  
Also, I was not sure what flair to give this post, so I added it as discussion...  


I have a MS Surface Pro7 (SP7) with no active cooling, I use it as intended (Light office work, web browsing, movies. (Not Gaming)). 

However, sometimes I need to run a VM or something. when I do this, the SP7 works as expected... It overheats and throttles the CPU/GPU.

So, because I am bored, I decided to 3D print an attachable cooling system, with 1 (or 2) small USB powered fans to cool it down in these specific cases. And, if nothing else, just to have fun trying.

(NOTE: It will not always be on, only for slightly intense tasks. this is important for future considerations)

&amp;#x200B;

So here are my major questions:

Is it better to design it to ""push"" air in, ""pull"" air out, or ""Push"" air in one way and ""pull"" from the other.?

I have reviewed the internals of the SP7 to see where the majority of heat is coming from, and where it is located. Basically CPU/GPU (SoC), RAM, and SSD.

&amp;#x200B;

I identified some potential issues with these 3 methods, basically:

&amp;#x200B;

**Push:**  
\- Forcing dust in to the SP7, this is bad as it is not easily user serviceable, and it is pretty hard to open.  
\+ The solution to this might be to include a removable fine-dust filter in to the air intake.

**Pull:**  
\- I have no idea, I don't have enough knowledge to find pros or cons... other than the dust issue.

**Push/Pull:**  
\- I am afraid of internally pulling hot air through an area/component that normally would not have that hot air going through it, and further overheating it (Eg, Pushing cool air through the CPU and pulling the hot air through the SSD area might cause the SSD to overheat more than normal)  


**Other** potential problem:  
\- The SP7 is designed to dissipate heat through its rear case, So attaching something to that area will interfere with it's normal heat dissipation.  
   \+ The possible solution to this would be to make the back plate of the cooling system out of aluminum (the part in contact with the SP7). This would be more efficient than plastic, and it would also be directly under the fan(s) so it would have extra cooling, all of this in addition to the air flow.  
... but I might be wrong...  


\-----

Does anyone have an idea on this matter? 

Any other potential benefits or problems?

&amp;#x200B;

The Long Version:

I started at this small company (&lt;100 employees) close to 2 years ago fresh out of an EE bachelor's. It is very fast paced, and my formative years spent welding, machining, and working on machines helped me make my way up the R&amp;D ladder quickly. Within 8 months I was the lead engineer over half the companies operations. I do most of the customer facing operations, almost all the equipment quotes and designs, and draw my designs. My boss does a great job of showing appreciation on paper, I received a 10k pay bump with the title change, and after some conversation on the constant 10-15hrs/wk overtime required I am now paid straight time for overtime.

The main problems I have with this position are the same ones that led my predecessor to vacate it. The lack of accountability on the production floor, disregard for all documentation and drawings I generate, absolutely unrealistic tinelines, and condescending attitudes I get for being young in the position are dragging my mental health to new lows. No one has made it longer than 2.5 years in this position in the 20 years this company has been in business, and I see why. The shop floor is full of a good old boys club, a group of guys who've worked together for 15+ years and don't like white collar folks. The foremen and general manager are in the club, and will always side with the tradesman in any dispute. These guys are good at what they do, but the world is changing and with the explosion of fully automated equipment into our niche market space we are having to adapt in ways they haven't dealt with before. The culture of throwing away my drawing set and building what they want has killed the margins abd deadlines on several concesutive projects, which I am held responsible for. This has soured my relations with both our primary customer (best friends with my general manager) and management. 

The new position offers a 5k pay reduction which is made up in a cheaper, higher quality benefits package. I also get 2 more weeks of vacation (currently have 1). A friend of mine has worked in engineering there for 2 years and loves it. Straight 40's with empathic management and a good culture is the claim, and it shone during the interview process. This position will be much slower paced, being responsible for a fraction of the capital projects with much longer timelines. 

I'm mainly looking for an unbiased opinion on my options. I feel like losing the 5k salary and overtime income is an acceptable trade for my weekends and mental health, but I'm inexperienced and worried that vacating such a high octane position will hurt my career development later on.

I have a question in regards to a floor joist that is visible from the basement. The joist in question is a 2x10 running about 15ft N/S where it rests on 3 2x10s (those sit on beams) that run E/W the length of the house, where then another 15ft 2x10 finishes the 30 ft run N/S. This beam has a split towards the end around 4 ft that rests on the 3 E/W 2x10s. House was built in the early 80's. I am the 2nd owner.

My first questions are;

Is this something I should consider getting fixed ASAP? Minus the potential of floor squeaks, is there an immediate danger to this stud and the structure? It is actually below the refrigerator so it has a constant load that slightly varies in additional weight.

If I were to fix it;

Should I add a sister joist next to it that runs the full 15ft? If I were to add a full ran sister joist, the end that rests on the sill plate (opposite end) has a hole where a lot of the house wiring is ran. I wouldn't want to rerun any wiring though, so if I ran a full 15ft joist, could I notch it at the end of the wiring and then [add this](https://nolanstructuralproducts.com/products/joist-repair-kit?variant=37829576327362) to the notch to give the joist the strength back? Or [this?](https://joistrepair.com/collections/featured-products/products/floor-joist-notch-repair-kit-210nr-repair-and-reinforcing-notched-2x10-and-12-joists-for-offset-toilet-flange-or-running-utilities-through-openings). I would look to glue, clamp and nail the sister joist to the original with 3-4 16d nails spaced 16"" apart, whatever would be correct.

Should I add a sister joist but not run it the full 15ft span to avoid the wiring? If so - how long should it be ran? How should I connect it to the main joist?

Should I add a noggin to the bad end between the E/W joist, subfloor and split joist?

Orrr, should I shut up and hire someone to do it? How would you recommend a fix?

So I am getting 3 tons of CO² to saturate 1 ton of CaO into 4 tons of CaCO³.

So 3 tons of CO² that's going to come out of 7500 tons of air assuming 100% efficiency. Wow, that seems like a big problem man !!

How do you pass 7500 tons of air through a solution containing CaO ? I feel like any liquids in there is going to just evaporate into your atmosphere ?

Also, some of that CaO or CaCO³ is going to get blow away ? How much of it after passing through 7500 tons of atmosphere ?

Just how much air is that ? So 1.225kg per cubic meter. So that is 6,122,448 cubic meter of air of 1/163 of a cubic kilometer.

Ok, how fast is that much air moving through our CaO ?

Ok, let's assume a surface of 6 by 3 meters. How ""thick"" it is is dependant on the amounts of added liquid and the final density of CaO per volume. 

I guess it could be nice to capture 1 ton per day of CO² per ton of CaO. 

So 18 square meters, passing 1/163 of a cubic kilometer in 24 hours. That is 3.9 meter/s per second. 

That sounds like Beaufort Wind Force level 3 ""Leaves and small twigs in constant motion; wind extends light flag.""

So, at this rate the whole solution is a frotty effervescent broth. Can you do away with liquids then ? Maybe just pass a shower of CaO powder in a gentle breeze of a push.

* About the first weeks the highest boss decides to talk shit about a former high performing employee spreading rumors about the former employees sister being a drug addict as well as this employee ""sleeping"" with his sister. I didn´t participate in this but the collegues around me seemed to be too afraid to stay silent against the boss (ie they participated in this shit talk)
* I got no education or mentoring. The guy Im supposed to work with has a habit of skipping meetings, being sloppy in working (he uses phone and not computer to communicate with customers which often leads to misunderstandings) and not being in the office for doing project work.
* People not talking to each other and displaying passive aggressive behaviour. Some are reluctant to answer questions regarding the work. I literally have a guy sitting in front of me and doesnt say good morning or hello when arriving to work. Also some bosses totally ignoring new employees and sometimes even screaming at other employees. 
* Also got a guy that tries to downplay my work by slipping small derragatory comments like ""oh that was your only job, you did it good I must say!"" even though I did much more. Also splaining things when I ask stuff due to lack of information recieved on the subject beforehand. Also not asking for help nicely but instead in a ""dominating"" manner, like ""hey engineerju, Im up here!. Would you help this guy right now!"". 
* Boss not being clear on my tasks and expectations for my role. Also not giving me influence in taking over some of the ""sloppy"" collegues tasks even though I would do them twice as fast and twice as good/accurate.

&gt; The regulations for the 2006 season brought a further turnabout, imposing a switch from V10 to V8 engines, and a displacement limit of 2,400 cc. This forced all manufacturers back to the drawing board. Tight constraints were also introduced on materials and construction, aimed at discouraging the most costly and exotic solutions.

&gt; Apart from the time pressure, the biggest challenge facing the engineers under the new rule was torsional vibrations with a high-revving V8 engine. V10 engines have a critical range between 12,500 and 13,500 rpm, but this is always a transient rpm range for the V10, whereas the V8’s critical range is in its steady-state operating band over 17,000 rpm. Sorting out vibration issues was complicated by the fact that since V8 racing engines are always designed with a single-plane crankshaft due to gas exchange reasons, the free inertia forces are far higher than for the V10. This was compounded by the fact that, due to the lower power output, the proportion of time spent at full load was increased by 7%.

What I *think* they're saying is that, because the crankshaft is not infinitely rigid in torsion, each firing event slightly and briefly accelerates the area around that cylinder's crankpin relative to the rest of the shaft, resulting in what is effectively a vibration, despite the lack of what would commonly be understood to be oscillation/an oscillation viewed from an external frame of reference. If that's what they mean by ""torsional vibration,"" then the shorter V8 crankshaft, given a similar design and material, would have a higher effective spring rate, which would then have a higher resonant frequency, resulting in different ""critical ranges"" for the two engine layouts.

Is that correct? Either way, how would you compensate for the vibrations? (They don't say.)

I have 6 fans in something looking like a case and I wanna connect to a thermostat. They are serial connected I think, because only 3 wires are coming out of the case: ground, phase and NULL. Is this diagram from the photo correct?

Practicaly what I need to do is:

Find a socket plug, cut it, unisolate a bit the wires and screw: Socket Null wire to the Fans Null wire, Socket Phase wire to the Line input in thermostat (number 5), and the other wire coming out from fans to the thermostat number 4. And of course ground to somewhere ground.

I am sure it's like that, just want you to confirm that.

But my doubts are: is this diagram for american type source? I live in Europe and we use 220/230V AC.

And on the side of the thermostat is written that maximum power is 30W. How can I know that my 6 fans are less than that? THey are about 13-14 cm in diameter.

For conversation sake, let’s say you do a valve job on an OHC engine and cut 0.015” off the seat. This would move the valve up in the head, making it stick 0.015” further out of the head on the camshaft side. This would then change the angle of the rocker arm, and in my mind change where the roller on the rocker arm contacts the cam lobe. (It would also change installed spring height and tension, but that can obviously and easily be corrected with shims) Wouldn’t this change effective lobe centerline, overlap, and other characteristics? I imagine you could get shorter valves or trim material off the tip of the valve (assuming there is enough meat above the keepers). My question does not only pertain to cutting valve seats, but any change that would effect the angle of the rocker arm relative to the camshaft(s) in an OHC engine.

&gt; The regulations for the 2006 season brought a further turnabout, imposing a switch from V10 to V8 engines, and a displacement limit of 2,400 cc. This forced all manufacturers back to the drawing board. Tight constraints were also introduced on materials and construction, aimed at discouraging the most costly and exotic solutions.

&gt; Apart from the time pressure, the biggest challenge facing the engineers under the new rule was torsional vibrations with a high-revving V8 engine. V10 engines have a critical range between 12,500 and 13,500 rpm, but this is always a transient rpm range for the V10, whereas the V8’s critical range is in its steady-state operating band over 17,000 rpm. Sorting out vibration issues was complicated by the fact that since V8 racing engines are always designed with a single-plane crankshaft due to gas exchange reasons, the free inertia forces are far higher than for the V10. This was compounded by the fact that, due to the lower power output, the proportion of time spent at full load was increased by 7%.

What I *think* they're saying is that, because the crankshaft is not infinitely rigid in torsion, each firing event slightly and briefly accelerates the area around that cylinder's crankpin relative to the rest of the shaft, resulting in what is effectively a vibration, despite the lack of what would commonly be understood to be oscillation/an oscillation viewed from an external frame of reference. If that's what they mean by ""torsional vibration,"" then the shorter V8 crankshaft, given a similar design and material, would have a higher effective spring rate, which would then have a higher resonant frequency, resulting in different ""critical ranges"" for the two engine layouts.

Is that correct? Either way, how would you compensate for the vibrations? (They don't say.)

This is a more philosophical question, but in a pragmatic sense.

Ultimately it boils down to a few points: 

 Engineering sustains the hardships that individuals face created by the system. Ultimately engineering is a tool for those with power to complete what they want done. It is a profession created by those with money to ensure that it is being spent well. Wherever that trickles down, you'll find our profession following the money trail. At best, our job is used to exploit the common discomforts of living, but often times these problems seemed to be caused by our own actions. 

&amp;#x200B;

By implication, a profession is one that furthers the system it resides in, but it feels to me that no other profession has as much an impact without as much choice on the bearings of society. We build bridges, subways, and skycrapers, and in their wake comes gentrification, exploitable poverty, and the herded masses of poor who hop to the next cheapest plot of land to cultivate. 

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't until I had my job that I saw how racism from the 1900's had a lasting impact on the economic wellbeing of black neighborhoods of today. And how those initial decisions are still dividing communities due to the runaway nature of capitalism. It's ability to grow is what makes it a powerful economic system, but it's also what causes the issues that many people talk about today. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of our methods of managing this economic force are gamified, creating some pocket of power that can be further exploited. Blame can be placed, but it never seems to fix the problem. So why can't it be fixed? Because we gain from keeping it broken, letting people fend for themselves, while we eat happily from the hand of our employer.

The problem is:

While my position is officially related to my degree, most of what I do (about 70%) is corporate paper-pushing and talking to suppliers or customers.  Even the actual engineering I do is more mechanical stuff.  Also, our plant has been doing what they've been doing for about 7 or 8 years.  It seems like a lot of the major stuff (e.g. block diagrams, process flow diagrams, instrumentation diagrams) has been worked out.  Sure, there are some minor tweaks needed once in a while, but that's it.

Also, the lead engineer in my division is a bit of a workaholic.  I've asked him if there's more work I can do personally.  But I've not really gotten a lot of new assignments.  Maybe the most serious thing - and it wasn't even necessarily ChemE -  was running some simulation in SimuLink, but anyone who read the paper and who knew how to use SimuLink/MATLAB could probably have done it. Granted, I've been out of engineering for several years and do need to google things once in a while.  Also my previous ChemE was R&amp;D in Pharma.  This job is process engineering in a plastics factory, so there is a bit of a learning curve at the moment.

The sum of all this -- both having not much to do, and needing to brush up frequently on stuff -- is basically giving me a case of impostor syndrome, and making me feel replaceable.  It seems any minute I might get laid off for someone fresh off their degree who's going to do it for less.

I should mention a few other things:

* The commute is a bit of a pain.  Typically 90 minutes each way, but if traffic is bad it can take longer.  Last weekend it took me 3 hours to get home because of traffic.  I've been considering getting a place closer to my job but that is of course considering that I do stay there after my probation period.  W/L balance is a huge factor, but that will ultimately depend on how things turn out in the coming weeks.
* I got the job from networking/a friend of a family friend.  There is good incentive for me to stay at least for a bit to see if things pick up, if only so I don't burn bridges. 
* My interests have changed over the years, and I'm not as interested in engineering as a career, but it may be too late at my age (early 30's, to change careers).

The way I see it, I either quit while I'm ahead (my interests have changed over the years), or stick it out and wait for a new project cycle to kick in.

We want a cheap and easy way to warm up the water, so we want to paint the tanks flat black. I need to show how much that’ll increase the water temperature in the tank. My thermodynamics is a little rusty so any help would be appreciated.

I thought what I could do was look at the solar irradiance of the region (5 kWh/m2/Day), which reduces down to about 210 W/m^2 or 210 J/(s*m^2). I have the general dimensions of the tanks, so I take the average between the area of the profile with the area of the top of the tank, and that’s how many Joules/second it receives.

The specific heat of water is 4.2J/g/°C, i.e. 4.2 joules of energy are required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree centigrade. 

Energy required (kJ) = 4.2 x volume (litres) x temperature rise (°C)

Assuming 5 good hours of sun a day, knowing the volume of the tanks, **and assuming an efficiency of 10%** I get the Δ°C of about 15.

But I know I’m making a lot of assumptions here with the surface area of the tank exposed to the sun at any given time fluctuating, and that along with all the other assumptions led me to my 10% efficiency guesstimate.
 
Please help me understand how to get closer to theoretical reality so I can have a more accurate calculation.

Does anyone have a line on any accredited online engineering programs in Canada or that would be accepted in Canada? 

I'm interested in pivoting into Engineering but I cannot afford to quit my fulltime job since I'm the sole breadwinner of my family. The reason for the pivot is because I've become engaged in a great number of new technology scouting and implementations (Solar, OMR, Geo-Thermal, Cogen, BioGas, IoT, AI, Machine Learning etc) across a couple of industries and have become very interested in the technical aspects of these technologies. Ideally, could get into either Electrical, Mechanical or AI.

My current background is actually Continuous Improvement with a Business degree and a couple of project management designations (PMP, ACP). I've been flip-flopping between a STEM degree or an MBA - the thought process for leaning towards engineering is that anyone can get an MBA but not everyone gets the technical knowledge. I'm late 30's if that matters. 

The Google Machine has come up with nothing too fruitful for Canadian programs and the American programs (UND, ASU, Stony Brook, etc) seem quite expensive and I'm not confident that the European (German in this case; International University of Applied Sciences) ones would be recognized in Canada. Hence the ask here. I have reached out to ask Engineers Canada about non-North American programs but haven't received word yet.

I enjoyed doing my job for a while, took pride in my work and really did everything to prove myself and learn as much as possible, since I had 0 experience in the field. Now about 1-2 months ago, they put me on quite a big project as work preparator. At first I was really excited, because people also kept telling they were jealous they couldn´t work on that project. However, the startup was really difficult because of bad deliveries, slow communication with the client, but also because I made some mistakes in the preparation, due to my lack of experience. This really caused some difficulties and even though now it´s all going quite smoothly again, I often go to work reluctantly. Even my sundays often get ruined because I have to go to work the next day. Even though when I´m at work I don´t mind it and actually enjoy much of it, with the days going by pretty fast as well now.

I'm getting some pretty weird readings and wondering if I'm missing something.

I have 250V input 16bit A/D with two BNC inputs, one measuring differential Voltage between Line and  Ground, one measuring between Neutral and Ground. Since I  just set the scope to sample rate of 1Ms/s to be safe from any aliasing and dealt with all the extra points. 

Building has 3 Phase power coming in split off into a lot of circuits and subpanels as one would expect from an office building. We also have some heavy duty lab equipment/welders/machine shop/auto shop equipment, dynamometers. None of which was running when I took my measurements. 

L-G waveforms look like a sine wave with noise, that was expected, they vary between 150/-150V peak-peak. Again looks sort of normal for standard 120VAC 60Hz USA wall outlet power. 

When I get the RMS out of it though I get about 105VAC RMS - Shouldn't I be getting 110 min to be ""in spec""? I'm using National instruments software to calculate RMS. I get the same readings when I make the scope calculate it though. 

What would be a better way to quantify the power at the outlets? What professional should I be talking to, electrician, engineer/consultant?

All of these careers (at the top levels) pay 4-10x the salary of even top engineers.  (ie. Neurosurgeon--MIN: $750k-$1M) (Partner at top Law Firm--$1M+), and you know about WALL STREET--$$$$.

It seems even most top engineers MAX OUT at like $250-300k (and no it doesn't count if you make this kind of money in San Francisco/Silicon Valley----This is basically a middle class salary there).

Since they are smart enough to get into MIT/CALTECH/Stanford for engineering....why don't they do these FAR more lucrative careers?  They also usually have Master's and PhD s from these schools too!!!!

I am currently choosing what fan to use, and I would like to know how to calculate what mass flow fan would be appropriate based on the desired test section velocity and size. This is simply done by just multiplying the test section area by desired velocity, for example a 0.01m\^2 area with 10m/s would require 360m\^3/h mass flow (10\*0.01\*60\^2).

However... This is real life and there will be losses in the diffuser, settling chamber, contraction and test section, so how would I calculate what mass flow I actually desire?

It is a blower design - a centrifugal fan, followed by a large angle diffuser, a settling chamber (likely just a honeycomb screen but could change), a contraction then a test chamber.

I am currently choosing what fan to use, and I would like to know how to calculate what mass flow fan would be appropriate based on the desired test section velocity and size. This is simply done by just multiplying the test section area by desired velocity, for example a 0.01m\^2 area with 10m/s would require 360m\^3/h mass flow (10\*0.01\*60\^2).

However... This is real life and there will be losses in the diffuser, settling chamber, contraction and test section, so how would I calculate what mass flow I actually desire?

We make devices that go in a system.

We have one device that is 20+ years old. The competition is so far ahead of us on this device, it's causing us to lose customers.

I've been working the past year on basically a band-aid fix for it. This fix is to hold us out until we can get a new design. I've been working under a principal engineer who started this project 3 years ago now. I'm worried this band-aid project is a sinking ship. 

I've also done quite a bit of thinking about what the new product will look like. I've proposed some novel concepts to the principal engineers I work with, with very positive feedback. 

My boss months ago, informed me that my previous boss had an opening on their team. My understanding if I stayed, was that I would be the owner for this device, including the future design. 

I presented today at a week-long series of meetings, a call with the entire leadership and gave a status update about the project. It was received well. Got a lot of compliments. I was the youngest person presenting by about 15 years. 

It was at this meeting that I found out that my boss intends to hire someone ""more senior"" to take over the new design. 

We had a 1:1 meeting today. He did ask me about my age, to say how impressive it was that I'm so young and already presenting to leadership. He gave me a few minor points of feedback for my presentation skills. Said I'm years ahead of where he was at my age...

I asked him about this plan to get a new hire to manage the project I wanted. He basically said that it wouldn't make sense to have someone with more experience be under me. And that I would still get to work on it too.

To me, this feels completely insulting. I've only ever gotten good feedback from 4 principal engineers, teammates, and some middle management. Always comments about my technical proficiency. I've never heard any negatives before.

A little about me: I'm 24. I also have ADHD and probably on the spectrum. I've always been described as smart, capable, and a ""self starter"" in 1:1's.

I'm at the top of my pay band, but I'm probably under-paid for the hours/effort I put in. I probably shouldn't work so hard without a promotion.

Am I right to be upset by this situation? I honestly feel completely insulted. I'm thinking of quitting, but I don't want to be impulsive here...

I've always been very accommodating, flexible, etc., This is the first and only battle I'm willing to pick.

Second, as the title suggests I am by no means an engineer or that great a mathematician, so apologies if my terminology is all over the place and/or confusing, and please be as layman as reasonably possible in your responses. Thank you.

Now then, the context - I have begun creating technical drawings (for machine parts) from a perspective of compliance with standards, and with a particular drawing, I need to specify a Bend Allowance (BA). I've done some research, but I simply can't make sense of it.

It may be wise to confirm my understanding of a BA is correct. From my interpretation, it is the length of the arc which the neutral axis follows throughout the bend in question. Next, my findings online indicate that to calculate BA, I need to know the relevant K Factor - I do not. The methods I have found to calculate K Factor either require knowing the BA, or do not make sense to me.

My alternative approach was to calculate BA using the neutral axis, so I looked into ways to determine the position of said axis in a given material. Some sources stated the neutral axis would be located at half the thickness of the material if it met certain criteria, such as being symmetrical - however others indicated that this wasn't strictly true, leaving me unable to trust the initial method. I also saw indications from other sources that applying a bend makes the neutral axis shift.

So, finally, allow me to show you the item in question:

[RH ACRYLIC DOOR](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dhgtwp90dx3bsne/Bend_Allowance_Reddit.png?dl=0) (For those who notice flaws in other aspects of the technical drawing, I'm only interested in this BA issue for now)

Next, allow me to share my attempt at solving this issue, as I would like to know where and why I went wrong, which I most likely have. My goal remained to try and determine the position of the neutral axis.

1. First, find 'Unbent' or Initial Length (IL). I already know this, as it is specified in the Bill of Materials for this part.
2. Find New Length --&gt; NL = (L^(1) \- R^(Max)) + (L^(2) \- R^(Max)) + R^(Max)
3. Subtract IL from NL, say that this new value is LD (Length Difference)
4. Bend Radius + LD = R^(Neutral) (The radius of the neutral axis' arc)
5. From here, it's simply a case of calculating the length of the arc. I don't like using radians, so I used --&gt; 2π (Bend Angle/360) R^(Neutral) = Arc Length

In my case, applying this method looks like this:

160 - \[(83.5 - 20) + (95 - 20) + 20\] = 1.5

15 + 1.5 = 16.5

And at this point I 'know' the position of the neutral axis. It seems far too easy, which is why I doubt my method is remotely correct. For the sake of posterity though...

2π (90/360) 16.5 = 25.9181

So... am I completely missing the mark? And if so, what is the proper approach?

Hope your day is going well!
So I'm working on putting a motor on a three wheeled vehicle (2 wheels rear, 1 wheel front) and something doesn't seem right with my calculations. I'm pretty sure its wrong somewhere and I am a beginner so honestly don't have any clue what I am doing lol. I'd appreciate any help!
Design Criteria
-vehicle must be able to travel up a 10% grade slope (6-7 degrees)
-vehicle will have a load of 444kg up said slope. speed can be 2-3 meters/second up this incline.
-Assuming load weight is large enough to account for any other forces acting against the vehicle (actual load will probably be less than 444kg)
So this is my work so far:
What we know:
velocity = 3 m/s
total weight = 444kg
angle of incline = 6 degrees
Wheel radius is 0.2032 m
so then we can plug and chug with these equations:
Force(acting against vehicle) = 444kg*9.81*sin(6degrees) = 455.28 N
Power = Force*velocity = 455.28*3=1365.86 W
Torque needed = 455.28*0.2032 = 92.51 Nm
So now I know that I need 92.51 Nm to start rolling up the incline. I found a motor with 4300RPM and 5.4 Nm of torque. I assumed the efficiency to be at 85%. I tried messing with the gear ratios with what's available and since the smallest sprocket is 9T T8f and largest is 74T T8f, I'd get a max gear ratio of 6.7:
GR = 74/9 = 6.7
Output torque ideal = 5.4*6.7 = 36.28
Output torque actual = 36.28*.85 = 30.8
Which would make my output torque 30.8(after accounting for efficiency). Which is a lot less than the previously calculated 92.51 Nm it would take to roll the vehicle uphill.
So solution I came up with was adding another axle in between, I can still increase the torque a bit more. Motor sprocket has 9T, Middle axle has a 11T and a 38T, Wheel axle has 74T.
9T would attach to 38T, 11T would attach to 74T.
GR = 38/9 * 74/11 = 28.4
New Ideal output torque= 28.4 * 5.4Nm(motor torque) = 147Nm
New actual output torque = 147*.85 = 125.18 Nm
That satisfies the design criteria since its greater than 92.51, but I'm not entirely sure I did this right. I feel like I made a mistake somewhere, or maybe my assumptions are not specific enough. Sorry for the long post, but if you think you could help me out with any advice/criticisms/suggestions, that would be much appreciated!!

I have a project related to design modification for a sheet metal product. There is an exhaust box that is currently being made from stamping using hard tools because of the shape of the box necessitates stamping. The box is designed in a way that allows water run off alongside flow of  exhaust out of the grate at the top of the box.  

I need ideas to make the necessary design change recommendations so that we eliminate the need for stamping completely and are able to use laser machines to make the blanks and then use press brakes to form the final exhaust box (or some other sheet metal process, roll forming etc whatever you think might work)while still providing the same function.   

Any and all ideas are welcome!

My university has practical work hour requirements, ie complete 800 hours of internship work. Throughout my time at uni I have looked and applied as much as my peers around me, but I never seemed to land any interviews, and hence have no real formal internship experience. I got some casual contracted work where I soldered antennas onto 1000 circuit boards for a friends business, and a research assistant position, but the university goes to pains to remind us that ""general"" and ""research"" hours are seriously second-rate to ""sub professional"".

I think this is because although things are running, I'm so critical of myself that I blame myself for almost everything that goes wrong or gets delayed or if I don't know how to do something, etc. I had an interview last year which I could describe as the most embarrassing 1 hour of my life. I had the serious personal connections, loads of strings pulled, and then they hit me with an entrance exam and I flunked it, no clue. My GPA is okay, not great, I work really really hard outside of the university to pay my way through it, and I've had a very rough last couple of years mentally. All good, I've addressed that before on this subreddit, I got involved in engineering clubs (CubeSat design woo!), got work as a research assistant in bioengineering, but I still feel so inadequate. And I am so burned out.

I guess I just can't bring myself to start applying, even though I need to. I have honours projects, CubeSat projects, exams at the end of this week, bioeng research supposed to be finished, and now I have to think about fucking up applications again. It takes so much brainpower and I read 10's of different tutorials on how to smash cover letters and CV's and stuff but to no avail. I'm not even sure if I want to stay in my country, but I'm such a boring person at this point I just don't know if I can do it. 7 day weeks for the last 5 months, man, and 70% of that time is just spent freaking out paralysed by all that I have to do.

If I ever take a day off doing anything, I'll always for something engineering-related and stress again, because I don't know what to do with myself when I have free time. Sure I'd love to travel and go out and engage in all that stuff, but I'm doing my best to pay my way through uni and that's my primary goal for this year. Leave it with no debts.

I was just thinking about how consumer generated power is an interesting problem as it’s kind of an uncontrolled input to an otherwise closely controlled system. 

For example, if a house has gone beyond satisfying their power needs with solar or something similar, and the grid is capable of accepting the excess power, how exactly is it returned to the grid?

Does it just use the same lines that would normally provide power to instead accept power into the grid?

Do the same system(s) that handle any modulation of voltage/amps/freq for power going into the house also handle modulating the power going out of the house?

If hypothetically there was a big shift at a random point in the day where consumers started generating significant power instead of consuming it, how would the grid adjust as to not overload hardware across the grid? Would any centralized power generation automatically be reduced? 

[Bonus hypothetical] What would happen if consumers or another third party suddenly started generating more power than the grid is capable of carrying.

The ""regular"" flowmeters will start measuring at 0.3 to 1m/s. I know flowmeters that can measure starting from 0.03 m/s (but the uncertainty at those rates is high, as you can expect). I'm thinking two possible solutions:

Solution 1. Build a bypass with a smaller pipe size and mount a flowmeter there and install the omega pipe in that bypass. This is not perfect nor suitable because I don't think it is a good idea not to measure in the main pipe (and I think it is substandard condition because the main flow measurement cannot be in the ""manteinance or bypass"" area). But i want to know what do you guys think.

Solution 2. Install a reduction directly in the main pipe.

In both cases, the reduction/bypass must be somewhat these diameter:

12"" -&gt; 6""  and install regular regular flowmeter (with high uncertainty because of the velocity)

6"" -&gt; 2"" and install a specialized low flow meter, because the flowrates will be low anyway

I think that kind of reduction is a bad idea since is too intrusive in my opinion but I don't see any other way.

Can you help me with this decision? I'd really appreciate your input.

Thanks in advance.

Note 2 : I already suggested to measure the flow as an open channel, but it is not suitable because of burocratic problems. Apparently they said that they will measure the flow in the pipe with a digital flowmeter and installing a parshall or measuring on a open channel with a areaxvelocity meter it is not exactly that.

I've made a post here a while back and it was incredibly helpful. Long story short; I'm introducing Ansys within our company and it requires me to calculate the heat transfer coefficient. I'm currently doing this by calculating the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers to then use Nusselt correlations to figure out the forced convection HTC.

However, Re is different based on the characteristic length, which is different based on the direction of flow over a cylinder. My calculations show that the heat transfer coefficient is 4 times lower when the flow is parallel to the cylinder than when the flow is perpendicular to the cylinder. This seems very strange to me since my gut feeling tells me there should be a difference, but definitely not this much. 

My current results are:

Parallel flow: 14,95 W/m2 k

Perpendicular flow: 59,27 W/m2 k

This has been calculated at 25 °C and 1 ATM with regular air travelling at 8,3 m/s over a cylinder 575mm long and with a diameter of 50mm.

Now my questions are

\- Do I even need to choose the length of the cylinder as characteristic length for the parallel HTC calculations? Or is that just the diameter again.

\- Should there normally be this big of a gap between HTC based on orientation with respect to the flow?

\- Am I just doing this whole thing wrong?

I'm currently using this document as my source for calculations:  [http://www.pathways.cu.edu.eg/ec/text-pdf/part%20b-9.pdf](http://www.pathways.cu.edu.eg/ec/text-pdf/part%20b-9.pdf)

Both are for senior systems engineering roles in aerospace. Both are for fairly small companies, where she would have a lot of ownership over the systems engineering process. One is working on drones company, and one is working on spacecraft.

Since I know systems engineering is a very loosely defined term, here I'm talking about requirements/specification creation, verification and validation, and those sorts of things (honestly those are really the only parts that I kind of understand, but I know there are other things to it).

Imo, one of the biggest differentiating factors that will influence her day to day work is the scale of these systems. I just feel like when you have a (relatively) smaller system like a drone there are less moving pieces, a smaller spec, less schedule pressure, and just generally less quantity of documentation, system interfaces, etc. you are able to give much more attention to detail, conversations might be more meaningful, and as a result I feel like your day-to-day work might look much different than if you were working on a spacecraft. For example, in her last systems engineer job on a spacecraft they had 1000's of requirements that needed to be approved and discussed with the stakeholders, 100's of change requests, and this sort of quantity existed for seemingly every of part of the system engineering process. She was staying up until midnight every night trying to bust through everything and as a result the as a overall process seemed less meaningful as it was just too much to piece together at once, and too large of quantity to give each piece the time it deserved.

Another thing that seems like it might drastically change what your systems engineering day-to-day work looks like is the development lifecycle. I suspect drones are developed on the order of months, where spacecraft are developed over the course of years and it's entirely possible you might not even be at the company to see the thing fly.

I realize this is kind of an absurdly specific topic, but if there are any systems engineers or engineers with relevant experience - any insight into how your day-to-day might change given the complexity of the product is much appreciated. I feel the size of the system and development lifecycle is going to be a large factor that influences her daily work and ultimately how happy she is at the job - but I could be totally wrong with this.

Lets say I code a 3-4-5 poly cam profile....for sake of example low dwell, rise, dwell, fall, dwell. You are given excel data for theta vs displacement (of the follower) from 0-360\*.

Lets also say the low dwell is when theta is 0-15\*. For simplicity rest of CAM data is irrelevant for this explanation.

Fast forward once the SVAJ plots are done......now we want a polar plot to see our actual cam geometry. Problem is if you polar plot at this point you will be intersecting the cam shaft center and will not be a correct representation......you need to add your base circle.

so lets assume i use polarplot(stotal+2) for a base circle of 2 with 'stotal' pointing to all my displacement data for the 360\*.

well now when i look at the actual polarplot with the base circle of two....the radius of the base circle has now taken my low dwell from 0-15\* and now is amost from 0-60\*.

Excuse my crudeness in explaining this, I am a a greenhorn. The assignment had me create my SVAJ plots and then polarplot with a base circle of 2. Which is exactly what I have done, however I feel like now my finished profile does not reflect the displacement vs theta I referenced from the excel sheet.

Thank you in advance.

Current Position:

Job: Mechanical Design Engineer

Type: Full time

Experience: 2 years (this was my first job out of university)

Location: Detroit (med COL)

Salary: $78k per year + all overtime I do is
paid based off of an hourly breakdown of my yearly salary.  I typically work 45's, so I'm actually bringing in mid 80's

Typical benefits (401K, health+dental, 5% cash bonus each year I've worked)


Govt. Offer:

Job: Research Mechanical Engineer (doing similar mechanical design work)

Type: Contracted (ORISE)

Location: (Low COL)

Salary: 64K

No benefits  (will have to research this more/ask my hiring manager, but from other ORISE posts I've seen online/on Reddit, benefits are not included with an ORISE contract)


The more I add up the numbers here, the more this offer slaps me in the face a bit.  To be fair, the hiring manager didn't know what I made before deciding on my offer, so maybe there's room to bump that offer up knowing my current pay.  Regardless that I'll be putting a counteroffer together, I'm a little nervous that I won't be able to negotiate even close to what I currently make.  

I know that I am lucky to have the salary + overtime policy that I have now, but I was expecting the salary downgrade to be dampened by some great govt. benefits - not the case.

This requierement is compulsary because in this factory they work with an explosive gas, and they dont want this gas escaping and infiltrate through the whole plant.

The area that the Air diffuser will occupy is about 1.5 m2 (16 ft2) and i also have an air flow of 12 m3/hour (0.2m3/sec or 7 CFM), so i start designing it and simulating it in solidworks, then Simscale and others softwares. My main concern is that, asking an ex proffesor, he told me that with standardized and common ecuations and considerations i could achive enough precision in my calculations. But sincerely i couldn't find the proper ecuations. If someone have experience in the fild and could recommend me some books, or papers or any kind of source that would be great.

I am using an NI USB-6008 (8 Inputs, 12-bit, 10 kS/s Multifuction I/O).  Since this device doesn’t have the ability to read resistance, I’ll have to read voltage, then convert the output to resistance.  I’ve attached a voltage divider (10k ohm resistor) between +5V and AI0.  I know from the thermistor datasheet:
RR = 3300 ohms     (reference resistance) @  TR = 100C +- 2.5% (reference temp)
Beta (0C/100C) = 3970 K  +-2% (It’s not clear if beta is in Kelvin or thousands, I thought this   value was unitless)
Then,
R1 = 10k resistor
Vi = +5V
V = voltage output at   AI0
R = thermistor  resistance
Now, I know: V = Vi * (RR/(R1 * R)).  At ambient lab temp, AI0 outputs ~2.735 V.  However, I use my multimeter to verify voltage between +5V and AI0 and get ~ 1V. First, I’ll use the datalogger value and convert to resistance with: R = (R1 * V) / (Vi – V) I get ~12075.06 ohms.  With this value, I want to convert to temperature and verify accuracy with:  
 
T = ((1/TR) + (1/B) * ln(R/RR))^-1
 
Before substituting values into the temp equation, I convert reference temp to Kelvin: 373.15.
 
                              T = ((1/373.15)+(1/397000) * ln(12075.06/3300))^-1
                              T ~ 372.8, then convert Kelvin back to Celsius: T = 372.8 – 273 = 99.8C.

I will try to contain/focus the rambling.

Essentially I’m worried about getting pidgeon holed in my current trajectory by doing absolutely no technical design work and have no desire to pursue management.


Essentially I’m a test analyst with a Mechanical Engineering degree at my current job and due to the nature of my work, I will leave it at that.

I’m looking to change to do interesting technical design work in the field of heat transfer for R&amp;D programs. I’m already a few years in on my current job and would prefer not to take the pay cuts to drop back down to an entry level position. Problem is, I’ve lost all of my calculus and other high level math that was drilled into my brain when I was straight out of school.

A few of the interesting jobs I’ve seen near me are looking for 3-6 years of work experience in their subject matter.

I’m wondering if the best way to substitute this work experience is to come up with some advanced project(s) to do at home and basically build up a small project portfolio to show since I’m not doing technical design work at the current job. Reasonable?

In addition, to brush up on the math, is it recommended to grind through the analytical math problems in this day and age? Every time I try to brush up on my math from my old textbooks, I’m reminded of how many hundreds of hours I had to put in over the years doing the reps to even be able to solve the problems (recognizing all the little trig tricks and calculus shortcuts for example).  In the field, are the numerical tools and solvers good enough now where we no longer have to be analytical solution wizards? Or is there still some heavy heavy analytical manipulation involved in R&amp;D projects? Very broad question, I know.

For what it’s worth, I do have a personal portfolio and work portfolio of analysis tools I’ve written in matlab for work, as well as AI projects in MATLAB and Python at home.

Hopefully I was able to somewhat articulate my position enough to warrant some advice. Basically just wondering how to make up for my technical design work gap.

I was a junior last year doing well having had done 10+ APs for some credit, national merit finalist in hs etc so generally good student and was doing well but then covid struck and we all got kicked out of housing (avoiding personal info) I went without access to internet and was forced to move into an environment I avoided for years. I became incredibly depressed and basically couldn't be bothered to finish my classes even though I basically just had to open and take the final ( I was so miserable and shameful of myself I thought I deserved to fail even if I could pass). I failed 3 classes just from avoidance and got withdrawn from the university and on top of that I went through a breakup and that was the cherry on top.

I appealed late in the summer when I felt a bit better and I thought I couldn't tell anyone that that happened and they luckily let me back in. I miraculously went back and my financial aid was miraculously given back as well at the sympathy of a counselor. I started to feel better around the fall, and somehow luckily I got a job around December at a very reputable company for systems engineering with a great program. The thing is the mental health issues left me barely scraping by as I wasn't properly able to be productive and got basically all D's in all my classes which was fine for graduating I suppose, but I'm nearing the end of spring semester and the classes I have exams for I could cram and take, but my very very last cs class in circuitry was asynchronous and I basically didn't even look at it doing half the assignments, missed all quizzes and lab attendance grade, and the final is in a week. I'm confident in my ability to do well on the final tbh, but even then it looks like I won't be able to pass the class.

My job is set to start in mid June, and I don't think I'll ever be lucky enough to receive an offer as amazing as this job in the current job climate and in general. It's basically 100k salary w amazing benefits and opportunities at a top 50 company. I can't take this class in the summer as it's not offered either. I emailed the professor recently and he said he's a little sympathetic but unless I get a doctor's note for some assignments, he is being strict with all his deadlines and giving 0's a minute late grading policy. I really don't know what to do and I've heard of people taking jobs and not saying anything which tbh seems possible in this case, but I also am afraid of the risks of that backfiring and sorta disappointed having done the work for 2 majors and not getting a degree. I really haven't told anyone about this as my peers are so happy for me, but graduation is in a few weeks (luckily optional so I don't have to tell family) and it's eating at me inside. Only in the last few weeks I've started to get my shit together from the support of a few incredible supportive people to recover my other classes but this one class seems unsalvageable.

What should I even do? My friends family and relatives are all expecting me to graduate with this job. Should I just start the job and not look back? Or do I tell my company, lose the opportunity, and take another semester in the fall to graduate (if my university even lets me attend again after failing so many classes). It's so stupid that I did this to myself especially when looking back all I had to do was the bare minimum, but I also can't forget how debilitating the shame and depression that I went through lead me here. If I start my job too, I think I'm really confident that I will do really well.

&amp;#x200B;

I've completed a prototype timing belt electronic focuser for my ETX 125 PE telescope, but I am having a lot of problems with getting it to work consistently. I am not an engineer. I've 3d printed some of the parts, including a black 60t timing pulley.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are some images of my prototype on the telescope:**

1. [https://1drv.ms/u/s!AkE7kGH6ek1YcMaSIwkVKeAsV0Q?e=iQL6j8](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AkE7kGH6ek1YcMaSIwkVKeAsV0Q?e=iQL6j8)
2. [https://1drv.ms/u/s!AkE7kGH6ek1Yb8Ml-uHK-8tl74Q?e=VHXXwg](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AkE7kGH6ek1Yb8Ml-uHK-8tl74Q?e=VHXXwg)
3. [https://1drv.ms/u/s!AkE7kGH6ek1Ycfk3kak4mtVVT8c?e=pvmFfi](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AkE7kGH6ek1Ycfk3kak4mtVVT8c?e=pvmFfi)

&amp;#x200B;

The Focuser shaft on the telescope moves gradually into the telescope as you turn the shaft to the right and does the opposite when turning it left. Picture 2 shows the focuser shaft when it has been turned many turns to the right and picture 3 shows the focuser shaft when it has been turned many turns to the left. This means the timing belt has to slide on the black timing pulley during rotation. The motor I am using is a 5V stepper motor called the 28BYJ-48 (motor specs: [https://components101.com/motors/28byj-48-stepper-motor](https://components101.com/motors/28byj-48-stepper-motor)). The stepper motor is controlled and powered by the 5V pass through an Arduino Nano (My code is posted at the end in case there are any potential issues there).

&amp;#x200B;

The main issue is: sometimes the stepper motor is unable to turn the belt; I've noticed the belt is tight in the direction of the rotation and will sag a little on the opposite side. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are a couple of potential causes:** 

1. the motor isn't providing enough torque.
2. the timing gears are not parallel enough.
3. there is too much friction as the belt slides on 60t timing pulley.
4. The timing belt does not have the correct tension.

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone give me some ideas on what I can do to make this design work or can someone suggest another system that would be less likely to have issues? If there are anymore details that I should give, please let me know. Thanks in advance to anyone who makes suggestions.

Another career advice thread coming at ya. 

I will be turning 29 this year and have had a lot of time to think about a career shift since the pandemic hit. In my 20's I pursued acting because it was something I fell in love with in high school. So much so, that I neglected my studies just to focus on acting. Long story short, the pandemic proved the value an actor can bring to a crisis (very little), and nowadays tiktok-ers have a better chance of booking a role with 10K+ followers than a person dedicated to the study of the craft. I also met a friend who at 50 struggles to get by even though he has 130+ credits on IMBd and by all rights, considered a master at what he does. Not for me, I want a more stable life now that I am older.

Most of my supporting jobs involved the service industry (go figure), but I was always considered a strong leader and salesperson. In my most recent job I worked on a luxury train where I was a tour guide/storyteller/bartender and made killer bank. After my first year, the company wanted to promote me into a leadership position and I believe I could've worked my way into management. The pandemic has postponed any further employment with the company, plus this gig was always meant to be a temporary cash grab anyway. What I am getting at is that my years spent in service and acting have allowed me to gain valuable people/soft skills and leadership qualities and experience.

I have felt that my lack of technical ability has hampered me in attaining better jobs, and I have developed a huge appreciation for math and physics since going back to upgrade my high school. My grades thus far are stellar (all 90+). I love using tools, and want to get my hands dirty. I'm creatively inclined and would fare well in design related work. I've worked on cars as a tech when I was fresh out of high school and enjoyed that job, so some mechanical aptitude is there. I'm also willing to work 12+ hours a day if needed to get what I want, I pride myself on my work ethic. 

For the last 1.5 years I've sat on the idea of mechanical engineering. At first I tried to dissuade myself from it, telling myself I am too ""artistic"" for this career path and wouldn't find success, which now I believe is bullshit. People can adapt and learn given the right attitude. Mechanical engineering, or engineering in general, appears to be great for its versatility even if you don't end up as an engineer giving good career options (technical sales, etc.), but what really interests me is product design engineering. Researching, prototyping, designing and getting a product ready for manufacturing sounds like something I would really enjoy and become great at. 

If you had to give advice to someone who wants to start a mechanical engineering degree and focus on product design, what might be some things to work on while in school? Specific skills that make you stand out in this profession? What can I do to get ahead and make up for my later start time age-wise? Is this even a good idea? Btw, I live in Vancouver, BC and have found a couple of product design companies that I've logged for future attempts to gain co-op positions with, but if anyone on here is familiar with the industry in Vancouver, I would love to hear your insight.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: People skills and leadership are my main strengths given my past work experience. I have very little experience regarding trades/engineering besides working as a tech on cars over 10 years ago, which I enjoyed and realized I possess some mechanical aptitude. I have a strong work ethic and I am interested in mechanical engineering, and would like to focus on product design engineering. Any advice/insight?

As [pictured](https://imgur.com/a/pz74sOH), there is a 7.5' span of the central load bearing beam (home is typical 35'x25' cape cod) that we are looking to sink up in the ceiling so the ceiling is flush. This is on the 1st floor, with a steel beam in the basement ceiling directly below it and there is a second floor above it. The ceiling joists are 2x10's, so we are hoping with that amount of room and the fact the span is only 7.5' that a flush beam will be possible and that the new point loads will be fine with the existing structure below. One, from this very high level information do you think a flush mount beam will be possible in this application? 

Two, one of the end bearings for this new flushed beam would be at an exterior wall. From my ""understanding"" (as a homeowner who has done some interwebz reading) the beam will most likely need a 3.5"" end bearing on each side to support it and carry the load down. Our designer has proposed [this](https://imgur.com/a/KJI5uNj), but we are hoping we could put that end bearing in between the studs right within the exterior wall and avoid this terrible bump-out. From the same high level, is this something that would be possible?

Not sure what they mean by ((Now imagine I gave you the number 1 and I wanted you to add 1)) or ((But, now lets say I wanted you to add one to every number between 0 and 3 on your classical computer.))


I’m trying to understand how classic computers do computation and count.

paragraph 1

To see why this is useful, let me give you this example.  Hopefully you know that numbers can be written in binary as a string of 0's and 1's (0=00, 1=01, 2=10, 3=11, etc).  Now imagine I gave you the number 1 and I wanted you to add 1 to it using a classical computer.  That would take you one computation to do that.  And now, let's say I did the same with a quantum computer.  Again, it would take one computation.  So quantum computers are no better at this point.  


paragraph 2

But, now lets say I wanted you to add one to every number between 0 and 3 on your classical computer.  Now, you would have to do 4 computations, you would add 1 to 0, then you would add 1 to 1, and so on, until you got to 3. However, for me on my quantum computer, I can use the idea of superposition to put two qubits in the state 00 AND 01 AND 10 AND 11 (that is 0 AND 1 AND 2 AND 3 in non-binary).  Now I can add 1 to that state and I will get an output of a superposition of all the answers.

My main interests that I'd like to do in a job would be math/s-based problem solving and/or programming. While my degree contains these components, the work I've done and what I've seen the qualified engineers do seems to be lacking in these. I'm aware there'd be variation between different companies/roles, but the industry is not huge here (Australia). 

My backup option at this point would be IT, and if I transfer ASAP it will only take half a year longer. However I'm aware engineering degrees are generally considered transferable. That being said, while I seem to able able to communicate fine in my role, I'm definitely not an outgoing, charismatic person so I feel like that pretty much blocks out the financial industry for me. So I'm wondering if it's worth finishing my EE degree then, or transfer to IT for a better chance(?) of getting into that industry/some sort of software developing/programming role. Thanks

I tried asking over on r/AerospaceEngineering but haven't gotten any sort of response.

I'm a fantasy writer who has been dabbling off and on with ideas for a SciFi story. I'm sort of a realist when I'm writing, so want to make sure that things are portrayed correctly (IE I use real swordsmanship drawn from historical manuscripts when writing fight scenes in my fantasy work) and could conceivably work.

Below is a concept for an aerospace fighter  for the story I'd been kicking around, and was looking for feedback on the design. Overall, the design is based on the SR-72 concept. It's a hypersonic fighter that will also be capable of operating in space:

[F4A-3S Wildcat Multiple Elevation Plan](http://dewyatt.net/Images/Screens/Schematic.png)

(Not sure why an Engineering reddit wouldn't allow direct post of images, but whatevs).

Mind the dirty edges in a few places. I'm still in the process of cleaning up the mesh.

The idea here is that the initial design was a suborbital hypersonic fighter that was adapted to an SSTO aerospace fighter (in the setting I'm developing, F denotes a suborbital fighter, SF designates a pure starfighter, and adding an S to the end of the model block of an atmospheric craft indicates an aerospace vessel capable of both). Besides adding an obvious cockpit, the main deviations from the SR-72 concept is slightly enlarging the wing and tail, and raising the thrustline of the main engines closer to vertically centered, while still leaving the intakes below the wings. The wing section is hexagonal.

Main propulsion is provided by Reactions System SABRE-style turborockets, one in each nacelle. Onboard LOx provides oxidant for high-altitude and space operations, as well as other low-oxygen environments. I've yet to decide if my setting will have mastered metallic hydrogen as a fuel source. Space maneuvering is provided by a combination of magnetic CMGs and RCS thrusters. The main engines will also posses vectored thrust nozzles (not yet modeled) for both atmospheric and space maneuvering. Main armament will consist of my interpretation of what an operational MARAUDER plasma cannon could look like, (right down to using banks of SHIVA Star capacitors) and I've thought of having a mission-specific loadout pod that could be fitted between the nacelles housing missiles or other ordinance, or a slipper-style external fuel tank.

I'm looking for feedback and suggestions to help finalize the design. For one, I'm not sure how to handle atmospheric maneuvering. I'd considered adding all-moving tailerons to the stabilizer, with full-span fowler flaps and leading edge slats to improve low-speed handling, however I don't know enough about aerospace design to guess whether that would be practical for a hypersonic machine. Conventional elevons on the wing could be an alternative, (I think that's what the SR-72 would use) though I lose the option for the flaps. Would the supermaneuverability provided by vector thrust nozzles make up for any benefit I could gain from flaps and slats at low speeds, making them unnecessary? I'd also thought of using a variable camber wing as well.

I've had my reasons to move, none of them related to salary bumps. If it means anything, I'm a power electronics design engineer currently working at a top tier defense contractor and I do enjoy my job so far, but due to family related reason I may have to move again in 1 or 1.5 more year(s).

Now 3 jobs in 5 years? In 2021, it still sounds red-flaggish especially in the hardware industry. 

However nearly every week I get hit up by recruiters in defense/hardware industry asking to interview for EE roles. What gives? 

Can't they see I'd be hopping nearly every year? Wouldn't this increase THEIR risk? Is this simply something that's not on their minds or is job hopping now becoming a norm? 

My other guess is: at my current job, most of the the senior power EEs are 50 or older. Some move onto management earlier than that but hardly anyone stays a design engineer way past their 60s, if not retired. And this is a field that is still equally important as it was decades ago and increasingly less and less engineering students are pursuing power electronics; 
At my university, if they do ECE, almost 80% of them choose CE. Of the EEs, 15% decide to eventually move into CE/IT/SW/Business and the remaining 5% are split between in analog, RF, power, systems, distribution, biomedical, etc. I think of my graduating class, I'm the only one who ended up as a power design engineer. 

So what this creates is a scarcity pool; you have senior engineers retiring or moving to management at a higher rate than ECE students even thinking about power electronics, and yet those jobs need to be filled somehow. 

Only having about 2 years worth of power experience, I've had recruiters mainly offer me mid/senior engineer roles when they can clearly see on my resume and LinkedIn that I don't have enough and that I'd look like a job hopper. But maybe there's something else to this?

First of all, thank you for taking time to answer this question.

I am a 25 years old Brazilian who just graduated in Materials Engineering in a Brazilian University. I also have eruopean dual citizenship, which will be important for this question.

I recently was selected in a Graduate Trainee program in a multinational company in my country. In this program, I will be starting as a Supervisor and it is a 'fast track' course to be a manager in the new branches of this company within my country.

I want to move out of my country. Europe is my to-go destination and I want to make ways to settle there in the future.

Before being selected for this Trainee Program, I applied for many Master's scholarships in Europe and I have really good prospects to be accepted into them. No tuition costs and even some monthly payments to help me live there while studying. 

The thing is, considering my future goal to settle and live in Europe, should I accept this Trainee posistion, get more experience and boost my CV with a Supervisor/Manager role (Sucking +6 years in my country) and in the future apply for a position in Europe? The fact that I have citizenship would be something that improves my chances, I think.

 Or should I go to the Master's  route and start my career in the European way  (I heard that in Europe the Master`s is almost a requirement when applying for jobs and to have a good career).

So I understand that for example ith a PID controller, the transfer function looks something like (Kd·s^2 + Kp·s+Ki) / s

I usually make it a habit to build a solid relationship with the recruiter right out the gate so it's super frustrating when im ghosted. 

Was wondering why this is the case? As far as I know, the hiring manager usually takes notes and ranks you with the other candidates - so they have solid reason(s) for not selecting you. Also, there is a small chance that the reason might be something the candidate can sue over, so maybe disclosing the reasons you weren't selected might risk the firm - I understand not giving a reason in this case.

If im not wrong, the way it's done now is the hiring manager usually contacts the recruiter and mentions - ""lets go with candidate x"". The recruiter will then go to their applicant onboarding software (greenhouse, lever, workday, etc) and send generic rejection emails to everyone not selected. 

Wouldnt it be way cooler if the hiring manager could share with the recruiter his/her notes on the candidate and why the candidate was not choose? The recruiter would then act as a gate to remove any material that might risk the firm before sharing it with the rejected candidate.

I already did my calculations, but I did it 2 ways and my answers are not the same. Please help. Here is the design problem:

I have the ""cart"" weighs 150 kg and has to be able to have 150 kg capacity, so it is a 300 kg body. It has to have 2 motors: each attatched to a gearbox and then to a 10"" diameter wheel.

For now, the variables I chose for my design are:

The cart has to reach 14.36 km/h or 3.99 m/s and must reach its max speed after 1.6 seconds. The motor has a rated speed of 2400 and a gearbox of 1:8 ratio.

I tried finding the power and torque 2 different ways, but they dont match. The first calculation I did was:

Cart max speed

vcart= Pi*(D)*nwheel = 3.14*0.254(m)*300(rpm)/60(sec/min)= 3.99 m/s = 14.36 km/h

Transition speed

vcart= (3.99/1.6)t

vcart= 2.49 t

Acceleration

a=2.49 m/s^2

Force needed to reach 3.99 m/s in 1.6 sec

F=ma=300*2.49= 780.51 N

1st method
Up until this point there isnt any problem. But now i use 2 different methods to find power and torque. The first one I did using the procedure found in this website: https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/car-acceleratio...

Distance traveled

d=d0+v0*t+a*(t^2)/2= 2.49*(1.6^2)/2= 3.19m

Power required

P=F*d/t= 780.51*3.19/1.6= 1557 W

Since there are 2 motors, each motor needs to be

Pm= P/2= 778 W = 1 HP

Wheel Torque
Tw=9.55*P/nwheel= 9.55*778/300= 24.78 Nm

Motor Torque
Tm= 9.55*P/nmotor= 9.55*778/2400= 3.1 Nm

2nd method

Force required by each wheel

Fw=F/2= 390.25N

Torque required for each wheel

Tw=F*r= 390.25(N)*0.127(m)= 49.56 Nm

Torque required for each motor

Tm= 49.56/8= 6.29 Nm

Power required for each motor

Pm= T*n/9.55= 6.29*2400/9.55= 1557 W = 2 HP

As you can see, 1 calculation says the motor needs 1 HP and 3.1 Nm of torque, but the other one says I need double the power and torque. I tried making sure that im not screwing up while considering that there are 2 motors but that doesnt appear to be the problem. Can you help me figure out what is the correct calculation? Is one of these methods flawed?

I'm an ECE master's student in the Midwest focused on Embedded Systems. I've been pursuing a summer internship for some time, and have been given offers from two different places, one company and one research institute (RI). Right now, I'm very torn between the two offers, and am wondering if any veterans or people who have been in my place before might be able to provide some perspective.

For the industry offer, I've been given the opportunity to work at a company in the Portland, OR area working on Analog SoC designs. The day-to-day tasks would be things such as FPGA design/verification, PCB schematic/layout, and embedded firmware development. From what I can gather, it's a small-company vibe, as the location I'd be at was a startup that got acquired several years ago. I would be required to relocate as it is an in-person internship. Thankfully, their internship program provides health insurance, a housing stipend, and relocation reimbursement.

For the RI offer, I've been offered a virtual internship (the RI is in Atlanta, GA) where I would join a team working in custom electro-optical systems. I'd be doing work related to embedded sw development, data analysis, and custom hw (FPGA) design/testing. With it being virtual, basically the only benefit I'd receive is my salary.

As far as salary goes, both positions are roughly equivalent. Also, I'm very interested in the technical work that goes on in both places, and have gotten along with the managers as well. Both places are also relatively renowned, with the 1st offer being an S&amp;P 500 company and the RI being attached to a prestigious engineering school. While I do value having an in-person experience, moving 1800+ miles away for a summer to a place I've never been to does seem a bit daunting. I'm not sure what Portland in general is like, but I do feel like the work itself would be fulfilling. However, I feel the same way about the work at the RI as well. I feel like part of what's made this decision difficult for me is that objectively, they seem almost equal.

Perhaps I'm confusing myself too much on the decision here, and just need to give it some thought on my own. However, I am definitely curious to see what the community thinks. I'll put this as a disclaimer now: I take full responsibility for the opportunity I choose, so don't feel shy to express any perspectives that may lean one way or the other.

I'm trying to find the settling time of a mass-spring-damper system. In my particular case the gain of the controller 'k' that is connected to the plant with TF = (k/s\^2+5s+k+1) is set to 2; k = 2. I've done the step response in matlab and got a few simulated results such as the settling time being 5.86 seconds. However, when I use the same transfer function and try to compute the settling time, my answer is way off (something like 1.6 seconds).

The formula I use for the settling time is 4/damping ratio \* natural frequency . I found the damping ratio using the formula (damper constant / 2 \* sqrt( spring constant\*Mass)) and the natural frequency using the formula (sqrt( spring constant/ Mass)).

I cross reference multiple sources and these formulas were proved to be true. I'm not sure what I'm missing that my settling time is so far off from matlab's.

We have an enclosure that is sealed. Let's say it contains 1 litre volume of air.

There is a design requirement that if this unit is in an aeroplane at 30,000 feet and the aircraft undergoes explosive decompression, the pressure inside the unit equalises in \~1 second and the pressure difference (inside unit to outside) does not go above \~20mBar to avoid damage to the internals of the unit.

So, we must have a vent hole(s) in the unit of a certain size / collective area to allow the necessary flow to occur in the given time.

I know there must be a formula for this but I'm rusty on gases and flows and the like, so can someone point me in the right direction before they just set the intern off with a power drill and a tyre pump and I'm forced to self-medicate with weapons-grade coffee?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\*

First off - I deliberately simplified some of the question because we're only trying to get in the ballpark here, also commercially confidential etc. etc.

So to answer questions as best I can:

I realise there's a lot of potential factors to this but in the basic 1st pass back-of-envelope calculation I really just need to get within an order of magnitude of vent hole size - are we likely to be drilling a 1mm hole in the box or a 10mm hole to get near the answer?

Hole geometry for now let's just call it a plain round hole (or holes) in a flat surface/plate that's 1mm thick material.

For the sake of simplicity let's just say we've got a box of said volume that is basically sealed/closed apart from the as-yet-unknown vent hole(s) as its sole source of pressure equalisation.

The unit needs to equalise its internal pressure to its surroundings through a vent hole, and the ""worst case"" test it has to pass is that it's suddenly (instantaneously) taken from 1 bar to 200mBar and must equalise to that within 1 second... or, alternatively, that the external pressure changes from 1 bar to 200mBar over a time of 1 second.

So I think the first part of this is simply airflow through an orifice as a function of pressure difference - if we can move \~1L of air with a pressure difference of \~800mBar through &lt;hole size&gt; in one second, that is going a long way to at least being in the right ballpark.",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,223476.0,public,self,Air pressure equalisation of enclosure within a certain time,0.0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/lqijx0/air_pressure_equalisation_of_enclosure_within_a/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,1614099772.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So I'm looking to create a secondary support at the midpoint of PVC shaft. The end is screwed into a motor shaft, and the opposite end will be spinning a weight of no more than 500g (most frequently less). Materials and dimensions are more than adequate for given loads and shaft speeds, my issue is with the shape of the support. 

You'll see two types supporting the shaft [in this image](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nvnvmcbcrli5pb5/SupportSlots.jpg?dl=0), one a semi circular that perfectly supports the shaft and the other a V slot type that supports it at two tangential points.  

The reason I'm looking at a V slot is the possibility of variation in either the shaft or the slot for the U shape one, which could cause incorrect alignment, too tight a fit if it's below tolerance etc, plus the V slot would have less friction. 

Is the V slot a good idea, dumb idea or am I completely overthinking this?

Robot is too large for RC car suspension systems (too soft and small), and too small for bicycle suspension systems (too stiff and hard to package). Hence I am planning on buying compression springs and building my own suspension system.

Other than the springs, which are easily available on McMaster, I am struggling to find a damper. Air/Hydraulic dampers for bicycles are, again, mostly too large. While RC dampers are too small.

 Hi, I´m in a tough position and would need some tips from you guys on what to do here. I graduated in 2020 and haven´t got a relevant job yet. So I got a job offer for a job  this week but havent gotten the contract and signed yet. The salary is good for a new grad like me and the job title is ""process specialist"" with the main responsibilities to plan and optimize working processes, create process descriptions, train operators, analyze process risks and work with improvement proposals as well as 6 sigma. Thing is for this job I will have to drive 40 minutes one way. It´s a fairly large global company and it will require travel to other countries and the job will pay for 6 sigma certificates. However, I´m not sure if this is a real engineering job or just a ""technician"" role? It sounds to me like a process engineer role but the company hasn´t labeled the position like that. Also, i´m afraid it limits my future career paths. The job is in the electrical manufacturing industry and I wan´t to try out the automotive industry as well as food industry within supply chain in the future, will this be possible? 

Also, I´ve read that the first job you take after graduation will affect your future career growth mostly, is this true? Thing is the company has moved very quickly from the first phone interview to booking me for health tests and now sending me the contract, all this within 2 weeks. It has led me to question if this really is the right choice and if it will be valuable experience for my future career. But jobs aren´t easy to get nowadays so I jumped on this with full force. But now I´ve been getting calls left and right from positions closer to me and that sounds more fun to me. Thing is I´ve got nothing else secured as of now, so should I take this job and work 1 year and then switch? Or should I decline it right now and try getting other jobs but risk being unemployed? What would you do in my position and what´s your thoughts on my future career changing possibillites into supply chain if I take this job? Also, is it too late to say no if I haven´t signes or gotten the contract yet (but said yes verbally)?

The Vapour compression cycle is also known as VCRS. Most of the domestic refrigeration systems like the Air conditioner or refrigerator work on the Vapour compression cycle.

We can say that the Vapour compression cycle is related to the [second law of thermodynamics](https://www.mechanicalpost.site/2020/07/second-law-of-thermodynamics-statements.html) (Clausius statement)

The vapor compression cycle has 4 main components, namely:

1. [Reciprocating compressor](https://www.mechanicalpost.site/2020/10/reciprocating-compressor.html)
2. Throttling device
3. Evaporator
4. Condenser

A throttling device is a pretty significant component of the vapour compression refrigeration cycle. The [expansion valve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_expansion_valve) and the [capillary tube](https://www.brighthubengineering.com/hvac/58420-capillary-tube-for-refrigeration-and-air-conditioning-systems/#%3A~%3Atext%3DCapillary%20tube%20is%20one%20of%2Cit%20would%20occupy%20less%20space.) are the two mostly used throttling devices you can find. The main function of it is to cause a pressure drop in the refrigerant.

**Working of the vapour compression cycle**

There are four main processes in the vapour compression cycle:

1. Compression
2. Condensation
3. Expansion
4. Vapourization

**Compression**

The refrigerant is in the form of cold &amp; dry vapour and enters the compressor at low pressure and low temperature. It is then converted into high pressure by the compressor. Compression leads to rising in temperature of the refrigerant vapour.

Therefore, the refrigerant is converted in a high-pressure, high-temperature vapour. Now the second process begins in the condenser.

**Condensation**

The condenser cools the refrigerant resulting in the phase change of the refrigerant from vapour to liquid. This hot liquid is then passed through the throttling device.

**Expansion**

The throttling device obstructs the flow of this high-pressure liquid refrigerant. Therefore it results in a sudden drop in pressure. Due to this sudden drop, the refrigerant boils and is converted into vapour. The heat required for phase change is taken by the liquid itself. Thus the vapour produced is very cold. refer fig below.

It is to be noted that not all the liquid is converted into vapour. Also, note that as the pressure of the liquid drops its boiling point also drops.

This partial vapour and liquid mixture is then sent to the evaporator.

**Vaporization**

The evaporator is a type of heat exchanger which is placed near the place which is to be cooled.

The cool vapour and liquid refrigerant mixture flows through the evaporator. This cool mixture absorbs the heat from the surrounding, therefore cooling it.

This heat absorbed by the refrigerant mixture due to which, the remaining liquid in the mixture evaporates thus now we can say all of the refrigerants is in vapor form. This situation is known as the 

**saturated vapour condition**.

The cold &amp; dry vapor is now again sent to the compressor and the cycle begins again!

Heat absorption from the surrounding takes place in the evaporator and heat rejection to the surrounding takes place in the condenser.

I am currently a mechanical engineering student who just finished first year. Please keep this in mind, as I am a very inexperienced engineering noob.

Recently, I became very interested in linkages and mechanism design from seeing videos of Theo Jansen's ""Strandbeest"". After watching those videos, I wanted to learn how to design a leg mechanism like his machines.

After reading and studying from textbooks, I designed the following leg mechanism and created the following CAD:

Mechanical Walker Render: [https://imgur.com/a/Q23Lax3](https://imgur.com/a/Q23Lax3)

I thought that since all of the parts of the mechanical walker will be 3D printed, a normal Arduino motor would be powerful enough to actuate all four of the legs. However, I learned from painful experience that I was very wrong:

[https://gfycat.com/spitefuldependentcod](https://gfycat.com/spitefuldependentcod)

A few thoughts/notes on this prototype

1. I poorly designed the shaft on which the gear and the input link is mounted onto. On the prototype shown in the video, the gear and the link are super-glued onto the shaft. From attempting to actuate the mechanism by rotating the gear by hand, I noticed that the gear partially rotates on the shaft without transmitting any of the rotation to the shaft itself. Furthermore, I actually can't actuate the mechanism by hand if I try to rotate the gear. The fact that the gear partially rotates without transmitting the rotation to the shaft tells me that the superglue joint between the gear and the shaft is ""flexible"", and not capable of transmitting the torque required
2. The mesh between the three spur gears are extremely tight, and I'm not sure if this will affect the performance of the system.
3. In the video, the motor doesn't even rotate the gears at all and stalls almost immediately. However, when I try to rotate the gears by hand, I can get them to rotate a little bit albeit none of the rotation is transferred to the shaft. Thus, this told me that the motor doesn't provide enough torque for the system.

Thus, I decided to teach myself dynamic analysis for about a week and did the actual math to figure out how much torque is required to rotate the input link at a constant angular velocity. After plugging in my equations into Matlab, I got extremely puzzling results.

For an angular velocity of 2 rad/s, I got the following torque graph:

[https://imgur.com/mvnhlaf](https://imgur.com/mvnhlaf)

A few things perplexed me about this graph, which I have come up with my own explanations:

1. The fact that the graph goes into the negatives. I expected all of the torque values to be positive, as I imagined that the motor has to ""push"" the input link to actuate the mechanism. However, my explanation for the graph going into the negative zone is the fact that the calculation was done to figure out the required torque to keep the angular velocity constant. Thus, at any point where the calculated input torque is negative it just means that any positive torque will create a angular acceleration.
2. The 2 spikes in the graphs also confused me. However, after comparing the torque graph to the leg mechanism design, I noticed that the spikes in torque occur when the input link (green link) is collinear to the long edge of the purple link (I have attacked links below to show this). The only reason I can think of which would cause these spikes in torque is that when the input link (green link) is collinear to the long edge of the purple link the mechanism is in a toggle position. (I'm not even sure it's a toggle position though, as when a toggle position is reached you can no longer drive the same link to actuate the system. However, I checked that the input link can be driven 360 degrees by hand)
   1. Negative Spike:   [https://imgur.com/PnabWPM](https://imgur.com/PnabWPM)
   2. Positive Spike:   [https://imgur.com/gmUKhrE](https://imgur.com/gmUKhrE)
3. The torque graph does extremely weird things when I play around with the angular velocity values. When I lower the angular velocity, I notice that the torque spikes even higher at the same points as discussed above. For example, when angular velocity of the input link is 2 rad/s the positive spike is around 33 N m. However, when angular velocity is 0.5 rad/s, the positive spike is around 1408 N m. I expected the spikes of torque and the torque in general to decrease when I decreased the angular velocity, but the inverse happened. I simply don't understand that.

After doing dynamic analysis of my linkage, I am totally lost. I think it's either all of my math is wrong, or I'm just interpreting the graphs wrong. I really just need advice on how to move forward from here. I know this was a really long post, but I'm really desperate for any kind of guidance.

Please think big and engineer a fungible parent container to improve the layout, absorbing the variation in cube of oversize and standard packages. The containers will be used as the final sortation, Associates moving the packages from a conveyor and into this container. Then, the same container is then staged, and loaded. In 2020, AMZL network cube per package increased by 19% (0.37 to 0.54 cut/ pkg) with individual site variation up to 0.28 cut/pkg. This resulted in average pick cycle time increase of 9 minutes 31 seconds (+22%) directly contributing to late wave departures. The goal is to create a container that holds both oversize packages unsorted and standard packages that are sorted into bags. This container needs to absorb the variation of package cube, reducing the variation in downstream processes. As the Associate moves packages from the conveyor and sort directly in the same container that will be stage. Please ensure to include a high level model with fill in data.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY APPROACH**

* The objective is to design a container/tote which can hold enough standard packages &amp; over-sized packages associated with a single order. This container/tote with 1 completed order is then staged and loaded
* A couple of ambiguity with the problem
   * I believe the metric **cut/pkg** is a typo and it actually means cu ft./pkg since a cube is normally mentioned in cu in. or cu ft. and the 0.37 to 0.54 value should be cu ft. Has anyone in Amazon heard the term cut/pkg?
   * *The network per cube increased by 19% (0.37 to 0.54 cut/pkg) -* I believe the 0.37 to 0.54 is a range of values for the network cube per package value (**since 0.37 to 0.54 is a 47% increase**). Please do let me know what you think about this.
   * The pick cycle time - I am not sure if they meant it as the pick to ship time or cycle time of just the pick process since this is a warehousing term varying between sites. But I assume this is pick to ship since it corresponds to late wave dispatches.
* I assumed that the 639.36 to 933.12 cu in./pkg are the cube of standard packages and from [here](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/201105770) i took the cube of oversized package as &gt; 2016 cu in./pkg
* I derived a maximization problem to maximize volume based on X(S), X(OS) &amp; Var.
   * 639.36 &lt;= X(S) &lt;= 933.12
   * X(OS) &gt;= 2016 cu in.
   * \-0.28 &lt;= Var &lt;= 0.28

The difficulty I had was on how to incorporate the pick cycle time to this model since there is a direct effect of container size on pick cycle time.

* The company bases pay rises at set % dependant on personal performance, but tiered %'s are the same across the whole company. Is this normal?

(i.e.:  under performance = 0%, good=0.6%, Great =1.8%, excellent=2.8%, promotion=5%) - and due to internal procedures since i've worked for technically less than one year on the date of the performance review i was unable to get more then a 'great'...

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this is not the correct subreddit to post this question but I graduated a little over 2 years ago with a degree in Informatics and have started working in the IT field doing support for about a year now (almost a year and a half). I am in my early to mid-twenties and during this pandemic, I have decided that I wanted to go back to school to pursue a degree in Engineering while I continue to work.

A little background about me is that, during my undergraduate, I was originally an Electrical Engineering major but switched to Informatics due to motivational reasons at the time.  But ever since this pandemic had started, and also, as I am slowly maturing, I feel like I am much more motivated to pursue a degree in Electrical Engineering now than ever before.

I enjoy math and problem-solving, and was able to get through my Calculus (I, II, III) courses without much stress. I had a harder time grasping physics though, and have only got through Physics I and II.

Right now, I am struggling to choose between a (Online Program) Master's in Industrial Engineering (I'll explain in a bit) or a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering (In-Person).

The reason I am choosing a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and not a Master's in it is because I know that a Master's in Electrical Engineering will require prior knowledge in Electrical Engineering to do well in, and at the same time, I feel like I would benefit more from gaining that knowledge in undergrad versus graduate. And also, I would like to avoid the GMAT/GRE at this time. However, I talked with the advisor regarding this path and he said that I have 68 credit left and assuming if I take 2 classes per semester, it could take me 5 years to finish this degree.

The reason I am also looking into a Master's in Industrial Engineering is because it more or less relates to my major in Informatics. I do have plans to becoming a manager someday and I know that a Master's would help me. And also, Industrial Engineering seems like a pretty interesting field to me and there is no GMAT/GRE requirement for the master's program I am looking into. But I also heard that this field was easy to get into if you already have a degree in one of the Big 4's (MechE, ChemE, CivE, EE). And because Engineering Master's program are typically not ABET accredited, I will not be able to get my PE.

Both career paths are interesting to me as well. For EE, I would like to do Energy and Power, as I heard it encompasses more math. And for IE, seeing that supply chain is huge now, I would like to develop and improve information processes. 

To note, both of these degrees will not be paid out of pocket. Industrial Engineering will be online and Electrical Engineering will be in person. I typically also do better in person than online.

Which path would you say would be a better choice for me?

Not having a great experience in my engineering career.. Really looking for advice. Wondering if i need to suck it up or if i should start looking for a new job? LOVE the actual engineering part and i don't want to let this company ruin engineering for me.

\------------------  


Im in my early 20's, been working as a ""Research Engineer"" building experimental prototypes of different ideas/projects that our company gets since i was 16. Only really ever had this job, worked with a lot of other engineers at companies but its more of the vendor-customer interactions. 

Always grown up with this fairytale idea that engineers all work as a team and can accomplish anything when working together. However, quickly finding out that its not the case where I currently am. Lately been putting up with a lot of things that im uncomfortable with. Everyone i try to talk to anyone in my company about it, they say its normal to deal with these types of things... really looking to see if these things are normal for other engineers to deal with, do i need to learn to suck it up or should i be looking for another job?

Super briefly, without making this a resume, heres a bullet point list of me and what i do:

Think im best described as some hybrid between Mechanical/Automation/Electrical Engineer  
\- 3D Modeling (3DExperience and CATIA V5)  
\- Electrical Design  
\- Additive Manufacturing  
\- Metrology  
\- Robotics (KUKA and ABB)  
\- PLC's (Siemens and AB)

Really just 3 major questions:  
1. Management

Apologize if some of this comes off as venting, in summary, i hate and i mean HATE how managment treats employees. Basically there is an inner circle of 3 people, if your not in the circle then your just treated horribly. Ive watched our director lay into someone to the point where they cried, worst part was he didnt stop, just kept going and going when it was obvious that the employee had enough and got the point but just continued to lay into him for a full hour... Really just a lot of unethical things going on. The way ive seen them keep people is basically measured by how much unethical stuff you see/involved in- the more you see, the more you get paid.  

Another thing that really bothers me is management not listening to anything we are saying. Which i understand is an issue everywhere, from what ive read this is a constant complaint from engineers.  Guess im just wondering if its always, the case? i mean we will have a meeting and clearly state the timeline is not doable for us, they dont care. We work 60-70 hours a week (while getting paid for 40) and still have to sit in one of the meetings like i described above when we miss the deadline. Just doesn't seem right

Not trying to come off as some ""stuck up kid"", apologize if it seems like that

Really i just dont know what to expect from typical engineering management, is this kind of stuff normal? it feels wrong but i don't really have anything to compare to.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Team work

Like i briefly said in the intro, always had this dream that i could be a part of this awesome imagineering or skunk works level engineering team that all worked together to build something amazing. However, where im currently at, people will intentionally make you fail just so they can look good and succeed. Almost feels like a war, you gotta pick a side and if your on the wrong side then i guess your going down. 

Im just tired of watching what i say because im too scared someone is going to use it against me or try and steal it. Been screwed twice now by two different people for sharing a design idea. not going to let it happen a 3rd.

Really just want a place where we can all share ideas, work as a team, no one individual person takes the credit for it but we get the credit as a team. everyone understands strengths and weakness of each member and the leader does a great job at using everyone to their strengths while also building their weakness.

Does this type of team mentality even exist to any extent or is this just one of those things you see in the movies?

  
3. Work/Life Balance  


You always see these great, genius people that created something unique and innovate but you look at their home life and its awful... Is it possible to have both? So far it seems like there truly is a balance when it comes to work/life, you can put it all into the work basket and be mega successful and have a really bad home life or vise versa. maybe you just need to find where you want to be?? if that's the case, any tips at doing this besides constantly moving jobs until you find the right balance?

For my undergrad senior thesis I worked with metal contacts to semiconductors and 2D novel semiconducting materials, and for my current RA I am working with superconducting magnets. I wanted to get a PhD because I want to become a professor, but there are a lot of people telling me a PhD is not worth it for a number of reasons.

Luckily, I got a research assistantship (RA), some scholarships and a fellowship, which means that financially, I'm at the same level as the average engineer entering industry with just a BS ($75k/year). My S/O is also an engineer and we would be DINKs, so finances aren't a problem. The thing that made me rethink is that if I don't end up wanting to be a professor, people have told me doors close for jobs that I would want. I remember going to the career fairs and seeing that all the jobs I wanted required an MS rather than a BS, but only said a PhD is preferred or made different criteria for someone with a PhD. I don't want to be out of a job after getting my PhD, especially if many of the jobs that benefit from having a PhD can be satisfied with a MS - I know money isn't everything, but I'd at least like to make some.

Also, 3-5 years doesn't seem too long to me, but I'm worried about getting burnt out since I just finished my BS in Engineering. I graduated in 3.5 years, but I can already feel myself feeling tired of school. I did really enjoy doing the research for my thesis though and I thought maybe the PhD would feel different, even though I'll be taking classes for the first 3 semesters.

So I was thinking about doing the BS to MS to PhD track, so in case I start feeling burnt out, I can take my masters and leave. The problem is, if I don't decide to leave, I'll be stuck taking 18 more credits than if I would've just went the BS to PhD route and another year of classes. By then, my assistantship, fellowships and scholarships would run out (my assistantship would be renewed, but I'd be making a lot less money). I know I wouldn't be able to be a research professor without a PhD, but I'm really scared that I won't succeed in the program. Nobody in my family has much advice for me since I'm the first to apply to grad school, first to go to university traditionally, and the only one to major in anything STEM related. I'm also worried advisers will just tell me whatever keeps me here the longest.

I (23M) am a Mechanical Engineer, working in Composite Structures and fuselage design for an aeronautical company. This was initially an entry level position. However, my superiors are enjoying my work and want me to evolve. 

I have a strong passion for composite systems, structural and solid mechanics and above all creating beautiful aircrafts - I work in the UAV field. Since there are still few mechanical norms we can go full on crazy on creativity, which I adore..  My company size right now is around 50 people. I consider myself a   classical mechanical engineer with the hand calculation of stresses, material choice, etc etc etc....

Thus, I have been given the opportunity to develop, a part-time PhD project, fully waivered by my company in my bachelor's faculty which is the best of the country. This PhD project would be in the designing of composite systems and my university is strong in this field as well.

I know this looks like a first world problem, however I would love to know your opinion on having a PhD on composite design in the mechanical/aeronautical field. Taking a part time PhD can be really stressful and take my 20's from my life. I am afraid not to be able to evolve my personal relationships because of that. This being said, my first reason I want to go on this endeavour is purely due to passion for this structures and aircrafts. I am really divided on this.

Anyone out there who or knows someone who has done the same? Any composite designer / mech. engineer that can give me some input on the necessities of the industry on PhD's in this area and are PhD's in general worth it?

My goal is to become Sr. Mechanical Engineer one day in aeronautical industry or similar. I love designing but I also know that I am still very young. I am also afraid that if I don't do the PhD now, I will never do it.

I this a good opportunity?

I bought an [infrared/movement Sensor including a controller](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B073FDC4PT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) to activate the light if, and only if, somebody moves in the hallway. My hallway is approx. 7 meter long. The infrared sensor was mounted at the highest point of my ceiling (2.4 meter) and was looking straight down. Unfortunately I could only archive a distance of 2 meter perpendicular to the sensor on each side of the hallway. So I could only cover 4 of my 7 meter. If I tilted the sensor to one direction I could easily activate the light from 3.5 meter away but of course the other side suffered and could only be activated if I stood almost under the sensor.

So my question is: Couldn't I just buy [another infrared sensor](https://www.conrad.de/de/p/whadda-vma314-pir-bewegungsmelder-96831.html) and solder the plus to the plus, minus to minus and data 1 to data 2 cable together and tilt both sensors to opposite directions to achieve full coverage? s. picture for better understanding. Note: Sensor 1 has a light sensor, so that the light could only be activated at night, but this shouldn't be interesting for this topic.

&amp;#x200B;

My fears are:

1. I don't know if the needed 5V could be send out from the controller to feed both sensors
2. What happens if sensor 1 detects a movement and sends a signal (I'm guessing something like a sinus half signal) on the datacabel. Wouldn't the signal split at the soldered junction and lose its amplitude? So the signal to the controller could be not strong enough to trigger a light activation?
3. What happens with the output datasignal from sensor 1 that goes as an input into the datasignal line of sensor 2? Could it interfere with the output of sensor 2? Electrical resonances or something like that? Or will it just be ignored by sensor 2 because the sensor is an output only?

I ended up with [this graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexkenan/pymae/master/chapter%203/chap3_graph.png). 

There are some pretty big assumptions though:

* I assumed constant acceleration so I could use the basic kinematic equations. Since dynamic pressure = 0.5 \* density \* velocity^2 , this meant that I could calculate velocity as a function of time v(t) with v = acceleration \* time. This also meant that I could calculate height with x = 0.5 \* acceleration * time^2 , and I used a NASA atmosphere model to calculate density as a function of altitude (height) rho(t). So, dynamic pressure ended up being 0.5 * rho(t) * velocity(t)^2.

* For the first attempt, I got the average acceleration of 51.76 ft/s^2 by calculating that the average rocket launch lasts 8.5 minutes, and the rocket goes from 0 mph to the minimum orbital velocity of 17,500 mph during the launch

That led me to calculate Max Q to be nearly 1 billion psf (6.9 million psi, 47,880 MPa). Clearly, that is absurd (I think?). So, I found some other resources that estimated average launch acceleration. Ultimately, I arrived at 390 million psf (2.71 million psi, 18,700 MPa). That still seems pretty high. Obviously, the average acceleration assumption is not realistic.

I'm a mechanical engineer working in the oil and gas industry in the US.  Other than a nine month stint at an aerospace company doing mechanical design work for US military aircraft right after graduation, the entirety of my 8 years experience has been in O&amp;G and has nil to do with control systems.  I graduated with a ton of debt so the jump to the O&amp;G industry was purely motivated by monetary benefit.  I didn't expect to be in the industry this long but the 2015 downturn and ever increasing life responsibilities kinda forced my hand.  

Anyway, the O&amp;G industry has been good to me but it's not my passion.  I am now in a position to forego some pay differential if necessary in favor of a career that better aligns with my interests. Since childhood I have been fascinated with aerospace and space exploration. My goal is find a career in those areas designing control systems.  I feel fortunate in my timing considering the recent leaps towards commercialization of the space sector and I am also an MSME grad student concentrating my studies in dynamic systems and controls.  I just got started this last semester but I've taken a graduate level vector calculus course (math credit) and control theory course that covered LTI systems, state space modeling and analysis, feedback control design, servo control design, and state estimation observer design.  I did really well in my control theory course and am enrolled in part 2 next semester. Also planning a DSC research project (non-thesis) with my advisor who runs the DSC lab at my school.  I'm a distance learner since I work full-time so a thesis isn't an option for me. 

My question is, for those of you working in this field (and more specifically in the aerospace/space sector) what did your career path look like?  How did you find your first gig?  How difficult is it to gain entry into the field within the aeronautics/astronautics industries? And any advice for someone like me trying to make this kind of career shift with little to no direct experience?

I'm in my mid 30's and have been a professional for almost a decade so I know the answer to my last question, in general, is networking, create a portfolio of projects related to DSC, cater resume to job descriptions, etc.  I guess what I'm really after is more granular details like: What are some good forums to find networking opportunities/mentors in addition to my university?  Suggestions for projects I can do at home that are relevant to hot areas of DSC in aerospace? What could I specifically do to make myself stand out to prospective employers in the field?

I'm not in a hurry and have some time before I complete my masters and/or start seriously pursuing employers.  I have the patience and will to put in the groundwork that will enable me to make the shift so, this post is part of my research to gain some insight.

1. Grant/ funding mills. This is when the company just takes investor money and doesn't really produce much of a product that it can sustain itself on.

I graduated college a couple years ago with a civil degree and am now planning on taking the PE Transportation exam this year. I am also planning on getting married and having kids within the next five or so years, and it's bringing up some questions about the future of my career. 

My partner and I agree we want to take a more traditional approach to parenting and we believe this will be the best thing for our currently non-existent kid(s). This would require me to pause my career for several years to be a stay at home mom. (I would rather be the one to stay at home and my partner will be able to bring in a much higher salary than I could). 

The problem with this plan is that my state requires you to renew your PE License every two years and you must be continuously employed doing “relevant” engineering work. To renew a PE License more than two years later would require a retake of the PE exam (ick). 

Given this I am wondering if taking the PE exam this year is worth it. I would still have to wait another two years after taking the exam to have my full 4 years of experience before I can get my license.

Initially, we were going to use the Maretron SSC-300, which is $595 (all links to the datasheets will be at the end). We soon realized that we needed something that can operate at a greater temperature, so I was assigned to spec out a new compass. I found something called the LSM303AGR. Not only can this handle a wider temperature margin, but it's also an integrated circuit, so it's much smaller than the SSC-300. It's also much cheaper, costing around $1-$2 per chip (depending on how much you buy). My plan was to use LSM303AGR instead of the SSC-300 and design the needed circuitry for it to connect with our system. However, I was wondering why the SSC-300 is so much more expensive. I'm currently a freshman in college will little practical engineering experience, so I can't really read the datasheet fully. When I asked another teammate, they said that it's probably because the SSC-300 had certification, as it was designed for marine use. But I feel like that isn't the only reason why. So basically I was wondering what drives the cost difference between the SSC-300 and the LSM303AGR. Thank you in advanced!

A question about fatigue and how it affects yield strength.

I'm working on a steel transport belt. During normal operation the cyclic load stays 3.5x below the yield strength, 5x below the UTS. So far so good in terms of fatigue.

However, during maintenance breaks, cleaners need to be able to stand on the belt. So an incidental high load. The design has been changed such, that the belt stays below its yield strength during this high load (bottom plate prevents high deflection). So a new belt will be able to handle the incidental high load. 

But is that still the case after 3 years? will the yield stress stay the same value or will it reduce over time? Will the belt at some point break unexpectedly during this high load? Or the other way around, does an incidental high-but-below-yield load even have a significant effect on the lifetime? (I feel like I'm staring too much at the S-N curve, but I'm not sure if that even applies to this incidental interruption)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking this question is more about the principles behind it, but if some numbers help to paint the picture:

* &gt;!structural S355 steel is used, so with a yield strength of 355MPa, UTS around 500MPa!&lt;
* &gt;!cyclic stress is around 100MPa!&lt;
* &gt;!Incidental load stays under 350 MPa!&lt;
* &gt;!cycle is symmetric, fully round in 2 minutes. So that's roughly 250.000 cycles per year. Lifetime should be at least 5 years. Cleaning is once in 4 weeks, walking around gives maybe 10 cycles per area?

By diluting a large stream, small instruments with smaller scales and ranges of operation can be used to measure flow rates and concentrations. This method involves injecting a tracer into a large stream and measuring the concentration of the tracer and a point sufficiently down stream from where the tracer was injected. The larger the flow rate and lower the tracer concentration at the measurement point. A gas containing 1.5 mol% CO2 flows in a pipeline. 25 kg of CO2/min is injected into the pipeline. When the gas is sampled 150 m downstream from the injection point, 2.8 mol% CO2 was measured. 

a. Draw and label the flow chart. 

b. Estimate the gas flow rate (kmol/min) just upstream of the injection point 

c. After 20 s since the injection of CO2 concentration at the measurement point starts to increase. Estimate the average velocity (m/s) *(5 marks)*. State any assumptions.

Hello!

This is my first post here so sorry if I'm breaking any rules! I'll try to correct any if they arise. I've also posted in /r/homeimprovemnt but wanted some more feedback here. 

My question is this: I am trying to hang a pullup bar in my detached garage/shop, but I have questions about the weight-bearing capacity of the trusses.

The shop is constructed pole beam-esque with 6x6 collums at 12ft intervals for a total shop length of 24ft. The trusses are located on said beams so there are only three of them in total with pulins running the distance between. The end trusses have bottom chords made of 2x6's while the center truss bottom chord is made with 2x4's that have been sistered with a sheet of plywood webbing between the two, all held together with glue and nails. The trusses span 20ft. The only load on the roof currently is sheet metal and insulation. 

I want to hang a pullup bar from the center truss maybe 12 inches off where it attaches to the support column. Gymnastics rings will also be hung from the bar. I've walked across the roof before so I know it can support weight by I am concerned about the dynamic load of pullups being applied directly to the bottom of the truss itself. There are also a few hairline cracks I'm slightly concerned about.

I do not feel comfortable mounting a bar without additional bracing. So this is my plan:

As you can see in the photos the trusses are set into the support columns through cutouts. I'll sister a  third 2x4 on the bottom chord on the side of the collum that isn't cut out so I can attach directly to it, starting at the column extending 6ft. The pullup bar is 4ft and centered on the 6th length. From here I will attach a 2x4 T-beam underneath the chord at a 45 degree angle with the perpendicular piece leading to the third sistered 2x and the flat part of the beam running to the original truss chord. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does this bracing seem appropriate? I do not plan to have any big swinging motions on the bar or rings, all movements will be fairly strict. You can see photos below to get a better idea of what I am trying to do. I didn't have a distant enough photo of the mounting side so I drew the intended bracing on the back of the chord, with another photo demoting the actual side where I would mount and brace.

Additionally, are there any thoughts on how long the diagonal brace should be? My first instinct is to try and center it where the load would be applied from the pullup bar.

Electronic component manufacturers started out grappling with the economic impact of the U.S.-China trade war. Then, the coronavirus pandemic began and introduced unprecedented operational and logistics disruption into the sector.

However, as the year rolled on, the world turned to advanced technology to cope with life in the ""new normal."" Companies and schools embraced remote work and learning tools to halt the spread of the pandemic. Employees, students, and organizations purchased new computing hardware to facilitate the transition. In addition, consumers turned to online platforms to buy groceries, interact with distant family, and stream video content.

Together, these developments facilitated [digital transformation](https://www.bdo.com/insights/business-financial-advisory/strategy,-technology-transformation/covid-19-is-accelerating-the-rise-of-the-digital-e) that should have taken years in just mere months.

Since semiconductors are the bedrock of modern technology, the sector not only [rebounded quickly](https://www.wakefieldresearch.com/blog/2020/06/24/semiconductor-industry-set-to-rebound-strongly) from COVID-19 but enjoyed meaningful year-over-year [growth](https://evertiq.com/news/48877?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+EvertiqCom%2FAll+%28evertiq.com+%3A%3A+Latest+news%29) because of robust demand.

As the recent digitalization wave has not yet crested, experts anticipate the [global semiconductor market to expand by 21 percent annually](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/news/penn-global-semiconductor-market-to-grow-12-in-2021) in 2021.

That said, manufacturers (OEMs and CMs) should be aware of multiple factors that may yet complicate part sourcing, availability, and costs in the near future.

Here’s a look at the technologies, semiconductor trends, and geopolitical developments that will shape the electronic components field next year.

## Auto Vehicle Production Will Lead to Unforeseen Shortages

The coronavirus outbreak had a [significant, deleterious impact](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/as-the-covid-19-crisis-hammers-the-auto-industry-electric-cars-remain-a-bright-spot) on the worldwide automotive industry. Simply put, when the world went into lockdown there simply was no reason to buy an automobile. This led to a staggering drop off in auto sales during 2020.

However, by the third quarter, car manufacturing resumed, and with it, [consumer demand](https://agmetalminer.com/2020/10/05/automotive-mmi-despite-low-inventory-q3-2020-automotive-sales-show-improvement/) began to recover. As the auto industry revival went on, electric vehicles (EVs) emerged as a key driver of the recovery.

The world’s largest EV maker delivered a [record number](https://electrek.co/2020/10/02/tesla-tsla-q3-record-delivery-electric-cars/) of personal transports in Q3. Similarly, legacy carmakers experienced [intense interest](https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-electric-hummer/gm-sells-out-first-year-of-electric-hummer-production-idUSL1N2HC2R3) in [new EVs](https://electrek.co/2020/09/25/vw-id-4-electric-suv-sold-out/) they intend to launch next year. Market analysts expect the wave that began this year to pick up significant steam in 2021, with battery-powered personal transport [sales rising 70 percent annually](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/30/forecast-2021-us-ev-sales-to-increase-70-year-over-year/).

What does this mean for the component industry? Because both traditional and electric vehicles house multiple, complex electronic systems composed of advanced semiconductors, the resurgence in auto production is already leading to a shortage of component availability.

Shortages in this particular vertical certainly carry drastic consequences. Original component manufacturers (OCM) know this and create production buffers to offset any such shortage. However, the pandemic placed unprecedented strain upon semiconductor companies in general, and specific demand in the auto industry in particular. No amount of shortage offset strategy could have prepared any OCM to plan appropriately.

Where does that leave things for 2021? With the auto industry already in full swing, components in this vertical are now a prized commodity. Car makers have greatly increased their orders for vehicle microcontrollers, integrated circuits, cabling, touchscreen interfaces, fuses, and sensors next year. This, inevitably, led most OCMs to cap out on predetermined shortage offsets. As a consequence, professional buyers will likely see constrained availability and sharp price fluctuations for those components in 2021.

## 5G Will Bolster Semiconductor Technology

Although wireless carriers worldwide have been rolling out their fifth-generation mobile data networks since early 2019, 5G hit an inflection point in 2020. Providers in Africa, North America, Asia, Australia, and Europe introduced [hundreds of millions of people to high bandwidth](https://www.statista.com/chart/23194/5g-networks-deployment-world-map/), low latency mobile data networks.

As the technology becomes more accessible by 2021, mobile device makers will see a considerable increase in new product demand. Canalys reports [544 million 5G-enabled smartphones will ship next year](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5g-smartphone-shipments-forecast-to-grow-by-more-than-1500-this-year/#:~:text=Looking%20ahead%2C%20overall%20smartphone%20shipments,544%20million%20units%20next%20year.). Gartner also predicts the forthcoming availability of [fifth-generation network-compatible laptops](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20200806PR201.html) will prompt widespread [business desktop to notebook computer conversions](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-05-26-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-device-shipments-to-decli).

The technology’s impact is not limited to the consumer electronics market. The ongoing deployment of 5G will create [massive Internet of Things (IoT) networks](https://www.qualcomm.com/media/documents/files/ihs-5g-economic-impact-study-2019.pdf) that will support automated factories, smart buildings, and autonomous vehicles.

Electronic component makers are addressing this unprecedented market growth by greatly expanding their [fifth-generation networking semiconductor portfolios](https://www.sourcengine.com/blog/how-5g-will-drive-semiconductor-demand-2020-08-11). However, those components will be more expensive than older parts because of the technology's relative newness.

The result of all this for both semiconductor manufacturing and industrial companies doing research and development in the area of 5G? There will be a rush to secure components both old and new. Some say that this rush has already begun and certain manufacturers have already filled out bidding quotas for parts.

## How to Mitigate Semiconductor Industry Volatility

Flare-ups in the trade war and ongoing surges of coronavirus cases made the semiconductor industry’s visibility extremely murky in 2020. Unfortunately, global commerce tensions and the pandemic will not magically disappear on January 1.

That said, electronics manufacturers can still take action to fortify their operations against 2021’s supply chain uncertainties. Firms, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), should diversify the sources of their materials to make their operations more resilient.

One of the best ways to do this is by securing new supply chains as we prepare for Q1 2021. How?

Like the end-markets they serve, SMEs should embrace digitalization as a solution to semiconductor industry volatility.

Online electronic components marketplaces like Sourcengine offer access to thousands of fully traceable suppliers and provide global shipping. It even offers a digitalized process for RFQs (request for quote). By using web-based platforms, firms can order millions of professionally inspected parts quickly and easily. Having this capability is critical in an era when part makers can be waylaid by new self-quarantine mandates or regional travel restrictions.

Ideally, 2021 will not have the same level of upheaval and disruption seen in 2020. But if it does, SMEs with resilient supply chain operations will have the resources and support to manage old and new headwinds.

Said saw cuts would allow plates to combine together into a square holed spray method of any angle needed for the injector and angles can be easily changed or added and manufacturing of said injectors would theoretically be much cheaper than almost any drilling method for injectors. Is this design or manufacturing method being utilized right now or is this a new idea? If it is a new idea, is it wise for me to post this? Lol

At any rate, I think that making this interlocking plate method might make injectors up to 15% less efficient but up to 40-60% more efficient for manufacturing. 

Id like thoughts on this method of manufacturing and what it’s disadvantages are in general and also the manufacturing advantages or disadvantages that it may have. The idea is that materials in plate form are far more cost efficient to saw into on a mass manufacturing capacity than drilling 1000’s of holes into a single plate.

I'd like to preface this by saying I'm an intern at the company I'm talking about and still in school, so I would just like to know your personal experiences / advice. 

I've been interning at a local company (fairly small: 4 engineers and several dozen machinists) for about 4 months. The fist couple of weeks were quite exciting and my boss had me doing some pretty interesting work to solve a problem on a project. Since then I've been glued to my desk making drawings and updating 3-D models all day. I sit next to the other engineers and from what I can see, they do the exact same thing all day, with the exception of an occasional meeting with the project manager or machinists. I barely talk to anyone, except when my boss comes by to give me a new assignment. I'm very grateful to have the opportunity to gain experience during this time, however I am concerned that maybe I'm not cut-out for engineering. I understand that you cant solve novel or interesting problems every day, but from what I've gathered this job is extremely repetitive and frankly boring to me. I still have so much to learn about this industry (manufacturing), but I am nearing graduation and want to make sure I make the correct decision about my future as engineer, whether it be at this company or another. I also feel a bit overwhelmed, because it is a small company, I don't want to ask for too much help and be a distraction to the other engineers; this causes me to doubt the work I make and often have to go back and make changes to it before it's officially released. I had to stay at the office several hours past my scheduling to fix some errors I made, and honestly it made me feel like such an idiot.

I designed some basic shelves for my garage that I plan to make out of Douglas fir 2x4's and particleboard. I don't know very much about building things out of wood so I have no idea if there is enough bracing. I took the time to include 2 walls of the garage into the FreeCAD program to make it clear how it will sit against the wall. The foundation in the garage on the wall I plan to mount this is 5"" lower than the rest of the house and it creates a small curb that I have to build around. The studs in the wall are 16"" on center so my rear legs will screw into every other stud. Doing some rough math, the maximum weight that I would need this to hold would probably be somewhere around 1,000 lbs distributed evenly across all shelves.

So I had a look, the [1995 Toyota LandCruiser Ute](https://www.redbook.com.au/cars/details/1995-toyota-landcruiser-manual-4x4/SPOT-ITM-278932/) had a towing Capacity of 3,500kg and a Payload of 1,000kg

The [2020 Toyota Landcruiser ute](https://www.redbook.com.au/cars/details/2020-toyota-landcruiser-gxl-manual-4x4/SPOT-ITM-541703/) has a Payload of 1,000kg and a Towing Capacity of 3,500kg

Now a vehicle under 4,500kg *can* be rated to tow 4,500kg and the aftermarket has made it easily possible with minor mods to upgrade the towing on the 2020 model to 4,500kg or even 7,000kg on a 5th wheel, and up the payload to 2,325kg with GVM/GCM upgrades.

But that said, why have the base cars coming out of the factory improved in specifications over the years?

Surely the improvements in safety, mettalurgy, engineering, design, rubber compounds for tyres, brake technology, and all the other surrounding stuff, computerised stability control, traction control, trailer sway control, all the assorted whizz-bangery and technologies should mean that cars these days are more reliable and able to do more?

However it's actually the reverse, cars have barely become any better in capabilities from factory, and if Farmers are to be believed, the new models have become *worse* in reliability over the old models.

I'm speaking to the Landcruiser because I know it, but I'm on some Dodge, RAM, Ford and Chevrolet groups (because I like seeing them if not for the fact they are bullshit expensive in Australia) and I do see people commenting that they can flog the living crap out of their old ""Trucks"" and they just eat it, but if they beat on the new ""Trucks"" they will soon bearings, blow diffs, etc.

Even when I looked at buying one of the Last run of Landrover Defenders before they released the new plastic ones, I was told it could tow 3,500kg on road, but *only 2,000kg off-road* because I'd break things.

Yet I grew up seeing the Landrover weirdos pull far more than legal 3,500kg off-road and never really break anything significant, maybe an axle here and there, maybe some propshaft bolts, but nothing serious.

Yet the salespeople were telling me the newer ones would honestly blow transfer cases, differentials, all that kind of jazz. I admired their honesty about it all, and eventually gave up and changed my lifestyle, this ending up in a cheaper ute and telling mates I wasn't going to haul their sorry arse off a track at 3AM with a car trailer. Mainly because I couldn't trust the car to do it, and I couldn't definitely do it legally at all (when I was younger I never really gave a shit)

But seriously, price of cars have gone up too, like a 1995 Cruiser had the same Capabilities as a 2020 one and cost $46,800 new, compared to the $70,600 they do now.

I understand that purely on inflation, $46,800 in 1995 Dollars is [$82,890 in 2019 Dollars](https://www.rba.gov.au/calculator/annualDecimal.html) however it's definitely perceived as still far more expensive now by people that were alive in 1995 (Again, discussing this with old farmers, they still reckon the $46,800 was more affordable then versus the $70,600 is now)

So yeah, I would have thought compared to 20-30 years ago, cars these days would be far better and more capable than they used to be.

I've marked this as Mechanical Engineering, but it could easily be covered by heais of stuff from other disciplines such as Hydraulic Engineering, Computer Engineering, Mettalurgical Engineering, Chemical Engineering (Oils and Brake fluids, etc)

These are the results of the experiment:

1. Particle and Size Composition  

   1. NaOH solution: quantity of particles having a size less than 0.08mm increased
   2. Ultrasonic Dispersion: no changes
   3. Dithionite–citrate–bicarbonate (DCB) solution:  

      1. quantity of clay-size increased
      2. quantity of particles having a size less than 0.002mm increased showing that free iron oxides can intensify the group of soil particles
2. Physical Properties  

   1. high specific gravity because of accumulation of iron
   2. natural void ratio greater than 1 because of its porous structure
   3. low bulk density
   4. high permeability coefficient
   5. high water content
   6. classified as clay and silt with high plasticity
   7. low swelling and high shrinkage potential  

      1. after remolding, shrinkage capacity increases
3. Mechanical Properties  

   1. difficult to compact because soil is rich in iron-bearing minerals  

      1. therefore, not suitable as filler material for either dam embankments or road subgrades
   2. Upon introducing wetting-drying cycles, strength decreases because the influence of saturation is expressed by a greater decrease in cohesion rather in internal friction angle
   3. Upon remolding and wetting-drying cycles, degree of deformation increased, collapse potential increased, and degree of collapse worsen
4. Mineral Composition  

   1. Kaolinite  

      1. XRD: strong peak
      2. DTA: large endothermic peak and sharp exothermic peak
   2. Gibbsite  

      1. XRD: weak peak
5. Microstructure Observation and Pore Characteristics (using SEM)  

   1. free iron oxides  

      1. act mainly as a form of cladding
      2. together with clay minerals, they work together to prevent dispersion, intensify strength of soil, and lessen swelling-shrinkage capacity
   2. upon wetting-drying cycles  

      1. intact structure becomes loose
      2. large aggregates disintegrated
      3. microcracks increased
   3. upon remolding  

      1. changes in microstructure
      2. pore size increased
6. Chemical Composition  

   1. acidic
   2. low organic matter
   3. high CEC values
   4. high specific area
   5. high silicon dioxide
   6. high free iron oxide
   7. high aluminum oxide
   8. low free silicon dioxide
   9. free metal oxides and their hydrates cement clay particles together  

      1. iron serves as cementation points in bonding of particles and aggregates together

Idiots. They would also insist on breaking all of my Civil 3D Smartlinks on projects so QA/QC was the equivalent of dog feces. Idiots.

My current job is at a city where I review plans and approve them when comparing them to code. At this point I’m using the job to sharpen my skills, and get a wide variety of site ideas and tricks to design like the pros. How not to treat city engineers. How to comply and get approval quickly.

If you can’t tell I’m very hyperbolic, but at work I’m much more amicable and sweet. I learned this from my first mentor in Land Development who would call your plans “dog$#!+” if they were not good, but then would turn around and be so sweet to clients. He is the type of boss I want to be.

From my second mentor, I learned the value of paying attention to small things, like construction details. Almost to the point of exhaustion. He was a genius, and I don’t say that about everyone. Think problem solving on a microlevel. Within mm of error. Unfortunately, he got fired for sexual harassment and aggression from where I knew him. Looks like those details finally got to him...

I want to make the following mechanism:

A horizontally rotating arm above water with an L-shaped part mounted underneath it. The L-shaped part is submerged in the box with water. 

I want to calculate the required motor torque to make the arm+L- shaped part rotate under water.

For this, I need the load torque and the acceleration torque.

For determining the load torque, i need the sideways force of water acting on the L shaped part. Then I need to multiple this force by the length of the arm.

However the thing im not sure about is how to calculate this drag force of the water acting on the rotating L shaped part.

I found the following formula:

Fdrag = Cd•A• (pV^2/2)

However the velocity V here is in m/s, while the L shaped parts speed is given in RPM. How can I adapt this formula to calculate the correct Fdrag?

I was reading about some of the more fantastical German experimental weapons and came across [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/worldwarwings.com/german-planes-armed-with-flamethrowers/%3famp). I found the idea intriguing and after a fair bit of thought ended up putting on one of my fictional fighters. Now, this was all well and good up until last night, when my brain came up with the idea of using that flamethrower as an anti-bomber weapon.


There are two main things that sound viable to me, but I don't know how well either would work.

1. The fighter flies over top of a bomber formation from the front. A lightly armored tank of napalm mounted to the bottom shoots a few jets of ignited napalm onto the bombers below. This would almost certainly create panic among the crews, but it might be able to start burning through the skin and frames of the aircraft. This could kill engines, take off wings, or even just kill the some of the crew inside if it landed in the right spot. It likely wouldn't outright kill all of the bombers, but it could make attacking fighters' jobs much easier. This carries the extreme disadvantage of carrying a tank of highly flammable stuff over a bomber formation, all of which will have turrets that can be shooting at you the whole time.

2. The fighter carries some kind of cluster munition launcher on the belly. The bomblets it fires would be filled with thermite, detonating on contact with any hard surface. If it hit an engine or fuel tank this could cause devastating effects on the target, though I'm not sure how well the thermite would work on a fast-moving target like that. Maybe if the bomblets were somehow sticky it would work better. Either way, though, this is a far departure from the original idea, though it would achieve a similar effect.


From an engineering standpoint, how viable do these ideas seem? I know that they're both pretty out there, but it could make for some exciting possibilities.

TDLR: Current Mechanical Engineer wants to know what coursework or steps I can take to learn about Mechatronics or Software Engineering so that I could potentially pivot careers in the future or add value to my current position. What coding language should I learn? Python? Would a certificate or Master's program be worth pursuing if my company will cover $10k/year?

A little back story on myself. I'm a mechanical engineer in his late-20's who has been working full-time for a little over 5 years. I have a BS (2015) and MS (2018) in Mechanical Engineer and most of my studies and research projects in college revolved around SAE Baja Drivetrain design, Composite design/analysis/manufacturing, and Structural Analysis. I also just recently completed a graduate-level Project Management Certificate, which I didn't find all that interesting. As a full-time engineer, I have worked in Aerospace (Failure Analysis on Hoists and Winches - 3 years) , Medical Devices (New Product Development group focusing on improving processes and ""automation"" - 1.5 years), and now Defense (Designing Ground Support Equipment for Satellites - 1 year). Out of all of my jobs, my current position has been the most enjoyable, challenging, and has given me the most opportunity to grow and develop.

That being said, I have an ""addiction"" of learning new things and always try to grow my knowledge-base in life and my career. I am wondering what my next step should be. I have always had some interest in controls and coding but never really knew how to jump into it.  Lately, most of my research at home has revolved around Electric Vehicle Conversions, how to modernize old cars, and active aerodynamics. Obviously, these systems can be very complicated and I feel like I should start working on significantly smaller projects. On that note, I don't have much experience with coding and electronics aside from using Matlab in college. However, some of my favorite projects or coursework in my Bachelor's involved using Matlab to solve various problems regarding vibrations and structural capabilities of composites.

While at the Medical Device company, our group was supposed to find new ways of automating processes that are predominately done by hand; however, there were no resources at my company (like software) that would allow me to learn coding and solve these complex solutions. Once we had a napkin sketch concept, our ideas were sent to an outside vendor and we became more of a project manager from there. I decided to leave after 1.5 years due to the toxic work environment and company culture. 

In my current position, things are a lot more technical, but almost all of our solutions are mechanical-based. While these solutions can be interesting and amaze me at times, they could be difficult to workaround or adjust. That being said, there are opportunities in my department where Mechatronics could potentially make our lives just a little bit easier. Also, there are plenty of opportunities within my company, both at my site and across the US, that has a huge need for Mechatronics or Software Engineers. My wife and I live in a High Cost of Living (HCOL) area and my work is in a much more expensive area, so, we have discussed potentially moving out of state the more our family grows.

From what I've read online, Python seems to be one of the easiest or most used coding languages. It seems like there are a lot of free resources on Coursera and Youtube. However, I'm not sure how I would be able to convey that experience to industry or on my resume. Are there any affordable certificate or Master's courses I could take to help validate any experience I get from learning at home? My work will cover $10k/year for certificates and coursework, I just have to pay taxes on anything that costs more than $5250 within that year.

Hello, I have always been interested in engineering and science since I was a child but I never had the chance to study physics or chemistry in my school. So I actually taught myself and still do to this very day. Two months ago I posted a question for where I could study if I did not have the grades, and I would like to thank this community once again for all the help I got, the one that interested me or I saw more of a possibility was in Germany. I have been contacting many German universities and even the German Embassy in my country. They aren´t the most loquacious when it comes to speaking in English with them which I completely understand, nonetheless they were very respectable and very kind. Currently I´m studying in UK for a bachelor in filmmaking. Since we film, edit, etc. I actually have a lot of spare time. So in that spare time I study physics, math, programming, chemistry, etc. The German universities told me that I would be able to study in Germany for any degree(bachelor wise) if I had a bachelor from a recognized university, I got this information in the anabin website as well.(My university is recognized but I don´t have the full picture on the bachelor) However they told me that there was more info and that they would send it to me, yet every time I send them a very specific email regarding the info I want they always send info on Master´s degrees, a completely understandable response, I try to clarify but they either send me the same thing, or just send a email to the bachelor degree admission requirements, where I don´t get the information.(It might actually be stated there, but I can´t spot it). However the reason I'm posting this question is if anybody has ever actually done this or if they have any knowledge regarding this procedure. I also started looking in universities in USA, they all seem to say yes, but I don´t see any information on it. I do understand that this procedure depends also on my previous grades in High School and my grades in my bachelor and how I'm as a student, but if I would have to do any additional work like a test or anything I'm more than open to do such a thing. The universities I'm interested in are RWTH Aachen and Technical University of Munich.(Interested in Electrical Engineering and Chemistry)

Thank You for your time. Have a nice day.

If you need any clarification please say so and I´ll explain, hope you can help.

DISCLAIMER: Military engineering is not the same as civilian engineering, but due to the technicality of the questions I seek answers to, I would rather post here than in a military forum.

I am commissioning as an Army Engineer Officer with a BS in Operations &amp; Supply Chain Management. Army Officers are asked to achieve Master's Degrees in Engineering Management, and achieve PE licensing. My questions are as follows:

1.) In the state of NC, you can board for a PE with a 'masters in engineering from a program that OFFERS ABET-approved degrees with 4 years of experience"" - does this mean if I take the Army up on its offer to achieve a Masters in Engineering Management I could board for a PE? Missouri S&amp;T offers ABET approved degrees.

2.) As a Supply Chain Major with a Lean Six Sigma Belt, I have a good statistical background and base knowledge. What function would a Engineering Management PE exam fall under (for study purposes)? I would MUCH PREFER Industrial and Systems, because looking at the study guide, many of the questions are on topics I am already grossly familiar with i.e. process capability, statistical quality control, etc..

3.) Post army questions. Suppose I was to leave Active Duty with a resume portraying the following: Bachelors of Science in Operations/Supply Chain Management, MS in Engineering Management, PMP, LSS Green Belt, and NC PE. How competitive could I be entering the civilian job market?

It would also help to have it relatively compact and with small actuation movement, and not blocking too much the section when fully opened. Oh, and of course boss tells me it shouldn't be too expensive.

Some random ideas that came to mind:

- [Multiple flappers throttle valve](https://i.imgur.com/Csao7G4.png): very compact, but encumbering cross-section when fully opened
- [Single flapper throttle valve](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/322547398471-0-1/s-l1000.jpg): great solution overall, but it gets very encumbering for large diameters (&gt;200mm)
- [Diaphragm](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/image-450w-232095232.jpg): looks like a good solution, but I'm worried that a central area would still remain open
- [Gate mechanism](https://www.semigroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_5900-1024x540.jpg): great but it's kinda encumbering on the side and the run is very long

For most of you if you hate your job it's your own fault. Be a better person and figure out how to be happy on your own instead of blaming it on your employer for the job not living up to your dream job expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen a ***LOT*** of posts on various subs where people are either unsure whether or not to accept a job offer, or they're miserable in their first job within 6mo or so of graduating. I just wanted to point out that working in industry is most definitely not college. In college you had tons of short (comparatively) assignments, very limited scope, frequent and recurring deliverables, a syllabus, and classes that ranged a wide variety of topics. In industry you'll likely end up only being exposed to a small subset of engineering technologies in your role but will get extremely deep in those topics, people may be looking to you to derive your own requirements, and the task duration can often be measured in months before you actually deliver your finished work product to your superiors.

Much of the difficulty, as I see it anyway, is centered around unmet expectations. The key to overcoming this is in understanding that your employer is not responsible for your expectations...you are. Stop imposing this fairytale vision of your career on your current role. I hear lots of kids that want to work somewhere that solves global warming, invents the new Mars lander, invents cold fusion, or lets you design the next fighter jet and also be the test pilot. Guys, for real. Tony Stark is a comic book character and most of the time awesome things are developed by teams of people doing mostly menial work with a handful of innovative spurts. Your first job out of school will have you doing paperwork tasks, or stress/strain calculations on a single bolted flange within a massive system of systems. That's what engineering IS for the vast majority of engineers. 

Over the course of your career you'll be in a bunch of different roles and you'll have glimpses and sprints of amazingly awesome work, but the majority of it is powerpoint charts, excel files, managing schedule/budget, and then the regular tasking for your job (be it software/firmware, PWB, mechanical, mfg, etc). Your happiness is not some external thing that you go out into the world and acquire through landing sweet jobs and solving global problems. Your happiness comes from the relationships you establish at work, and from within. If you're unhappy it's because you need better relationships at work and/or a personal attitude adjustment in life. 

If you work at an honest and ethical company, with decent coworkers, your bills are getting paid, and you still are somehow miserable, then it's your own fault. Stop whining. Make enormous efforts to be a wonderful human being. Be a friend to your coworkers. Go out of your way to be grateful when others help you. Give your leadership unsolicited positive feedback on your coworkers. Never speak poorly of anyone, to anyone. Stay occupied when you're on company time and after your work is complete, find other things to do without being asked. Always be willing to help those that need it, especially younger engineers. If you're a great person, people will treat you like it and this will feed most of what people are lacking in job fulfilment. 

For some reason the younger generations are graduating with these huge expectations about going out into the world and crushing it at some cutting edge development that changes life for all of us. To be sure, a tiny handful of you may do that very thing. But the reason so many kids are unsatisfied is because they aren't that good. Lots of kids played basketball in high school and few of them were good enough to play in college, and even fewer were good enough to play in the NBA after that. Engineers are the academic equivalent to 19yr old kids that are miffed the NBA passed them up. Most of you simply aren't good enough, aren't well connected enough, and weren't presented with the right opportunities. Does that mean you shouldn't be happy in life? No, of course not. So why are so many of you miserable? Most of us will never be famous, never solve global warming, and never be Elon Musk. Who cares though? Elon works more hours than anybody I know personally but his family life sucks compared to mine.

What you kids need to be focusing on is learning. Every job/role has a handful of golden nuggets of information that you'll learn. Those things will make you a better person and a better engineer. Gather what you can from each job and try your darndest to share it with others in the process. While you're doing that, continue trawling the waters in the engineering job market and be ready to pounce when better opportunities arise. If you want to be a NASA JPL Engineer, do the research and see what it takes to get there. But if you apply 50 times and never get the job, you're in your early 20's and still have 30-40 years of career life ahead of you. Pick something else and get to work.

Stop chasing your passions and dreams professionally. I'm not saying don't have them, or completely disregard them. I'm saying temper them. People that give career advice like ""follow your dreams"" are complete idiots. Find a job you don't hate, that also pays well for the skills you have to offer, take it, and then learn to love it as you go. If after 6 months you're still not loving it, try harder. I've worked 26 different programs across 3 different companies in my professional career and I've only hated 2 roles. One of them I left the company over, because we had ineffective management. But I lasted 2 years there. The other one I'm still currently in but I have such great friendships with my coworkers that we all end up being happy still, despite getting creamed by schedule and a particularly abrasive program lead. 

You need a good job, and you need to constantly be working towards improving your career. I am by no means advocating complacency or giving up. I'm saying that you need to stop trying to make your dreams and your career be the same thing. My career is in aerospace and I work on some cool stuff. But my dreams are in old school trucks. So I spend my nights and weekends teaching my daughter how to turn wrenches and build motors in our garage. That's my dream. That's were I'm most fulfilled. During the week I spend 40-50 hours doing something I tolerate, with some people I've grown close to, and get paid a stupid good wage to do it. 

Please...and I mean PLEASE stop expecting to love your jobs. You need to work on yourself to become a better person, and to make your jobs better. If everyone you work with is miserable, you be the one to bring the light back into the office. Your happiness comes from within and if you can't figure that out you're going to hate being an engineer. My whole job is hard.

It got better, but I would really worry that admissions officers (of any ABET accredited program/otherwise respected program) would be concerned.

I enjoy my work to a fair degree, but cannot imagine maintaining this trajectory for the rest of my career, especially when weighing the finances.  The engineering pay scales appear to be high floor low ceiling.  I’m earning a decent salary now in my early 30’s, but looking forward, it feels like diminishing returns.  For example, the most respected senior engineers I know aren’t earning more than 40% my salary, despite having 3 decades more experience. 

I’m entertaining management roles and exploring MBA programs looking for a job that both provides more fulfillment and helps me meet my financial goals, but it looks sooooo costly and seems like it only tightens the golden handcuffs, as opposed to affording more personal freedom and control over my work, which is my real goal. Also, I’m not certain management would be a good fit for me. 


Alternatively, I have also considered starting a small side business (non engineering related) as a means of achieving my financial goals separate from work.  This would provide more control over my work and earnings, and I could keep my day job at arms length. I am very excited about this idea, the challenge of doing it, and the potential for earning additional income that helps meet my other goals.

I'm building my ultimate bedroom. In this bedroom will be a very large bed (two queens). Because my bed is so big it will be hard to get in and out of it while watching a movie. If I decide to eat a snack while in bed I'd like to have a surface the snack can sit on. When I'm done eating I'd like to push the surface away and have an arm just holding it above my head or off to the side. Or if I want to pass the snack to my friend I'd like to move the surface over in front of them.

I have some lamps that do something similar. I can move the lamp all around and point it anywhere and it stays in that position. Basically want the same experience but with a small surface/table which would require it to hold a bit more weight.

However as a truck driver, I full on believe that I can *feel* the extra resistance when driving a Cabover truck versus a bonneted truck.

Plus from my experience, our Bonnet trucks got better economy over our new Cabovers at work.

The old bonnet trucks did around 650km from 400l of Diesel, these were running Mack Engines designed in the 70's, so an economy of 61.54l/100km at 55 tonnes

The new trucks are a tad heavier, I've not had one past 60 tonnes, however we get down to 350km from 400l of Diesel, which comes to 114.29l/100km on some runs.

The new heavy transporter (low loader) can get, on a good day, 200l/100km and if terrain is bad, even less, but that's in excess of 100 tonnes.

However then you go across to companies that make bonnet trucks, so for example the drag co-efficient of a Tesla Semi is 0.35, most Bonnet trucks get around 0.5 and most Cabovers get as high as 0.9

So it makes me think if anyone knows how to reduce aerodynamic drag, it would be Tesla, so they clearly picked a bonnet truck for a reason.

Now, to me, even with the DPF and DEF and all the other emissions gear, the fact that our new trucks that are Euro 5 are chewing damn near double the fuel of our old trucks at a similar weight makes me wonder, is this Euro 5 Emissions stuff actually achieving anything?

Would Manufacturers possibly see better gains from making more aerodynamic bonnet trucks? I get that you might have to knock maybe 2-4 pallet spaces off a trailer to get the overall length to be the same, to remain under dimension limits, however if you're spending half the money on fuel, surely those savings could stack up over 1,000,000kms?

For reference, our Cabovers will chew 1,142,900 litres of fuel, the old truck would chew 615,400 litres, so a saving of 527,500 litres over the life of the truck, or at current Australian prices of $1.19/l that's around $627,725 AUD per truck, so a fleet of trucks us a massive fuel saving

So looking at a cost of $2.05/km on average to operate a truck in Australia, and an average 45ft trailer so for 26 pallets that's around $0.07884615/pallet/km

So freight of 1,500km as an average would be $118.27/pallet per trip

So if your average trip is 1,500km then you would get 666 trips out of your truck per million kilometres.

So that's $78,767.82 earned by that truck per pallet space, so removing 2 pallet spaces would lose $157,535.64 over the lifetime of the truck, 4 spaces would lose $315,071.28 so even losing 4 whole pallet spaces to run a bonnet truck to a Cabover would still net you a saving over the life of the truck of around $312,654 if the fuel savings I've observed hold true.

So yeah, it's got me wondering why Euro Emissions aren't calling for more efficient truck shapes, and instead seem to focus on engines and exhaust emissions?

Is there a practical reason why Cabovers are still preferred by European truck Manufacturers and why a lot of the trucks coming out now to Euro emissions standards, even from companies like Kenworth are pushing Cabovers, with the bonnet trucks being more focused on the heavy lifting (Like the T909 being aimed at Road Train work and the Mack Titan being targeted at Heavy Haulage) where economy and emissions aren't as much of a concern?",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,200652.0,public,self,"If the EU is so focused on Euro emissions standards, why is there not more focus on truck design?",0.0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/j364x9/if_the_eu_is_so_focused_on_euro_emissions/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For airflow:
* I have a ceiling fan
* I have a box fan
* I tried opening the window one night and found no air comes in. There's 0 airflow. Even with a box fan pointing out the window for a few hours to push warm air out, and then facing in all night long to get cool air in...it did basically nothing. I'm used to being able to open my window at night to let cool air in and get some air circulation and that's it (even in a non windy city) but that just doesn't work. :/ My roommates room is great but switching isn't an option (asked day 1) and she's a good roommate so I'm otherwise not banking on getting her to move out. I just need to get airflow to work...

I'm sweating at night without the AC, but live in a dry climate that's cool at night so trying to figure out how to arrange box fan(s?) That I can get some airflow. Going to try to attach an imgur drawing floorplan for clarity. 

For light: 
* I vaguely know heliostats exist and you can use mirrors to reflect light in but not sure how. In my room in the morning it could clearly be so bright outside and so dark inside. 
* Since the patio is directly outside my window does anyone know or suggest how to do this to get light in without a mirror falling a few floors into a neighbor?",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,200318.0,public,self,"I feel like my googling is bordering on solving an engineering problem, help!

maths proves

1=0.999...

0.999...

""the 9s dont stop""

thus

0.999.. is an infinite decimal non-integer

just like

0.888... the 8s dont stop thus is an infinite decimal non-integer

0.777... the 7s dont stop thus is an infinite decimal non-integer

0.666... the 6s dont stop thus is an infinite decimal non-integer

so when

that means

we have a contradiction

or again

when maths proves 1=0.999...

thus

Let be x = 0.999.. [the notation means 0.999.. you admit ""The 9's never stop"" thus is an infinite decimal is a non-integer]

10x = 9.999...

10x-x =9.999...- 0.999...

9x=9

x= 1 [the notation mean 1 is a whole number an integer]

it is proven an integer (1) = a non-integer (0.999...) [you admit ""The 9's never stop""thus a infinite decimal thus non-integer] maths ends in contradiction

A 1 unit by 1 unit triangle is a contradiction in terms-the length of the hypotenuse is root 2. Ie non-finite which does not terminate ie can never be constructed- thus the triangle can never be constructed Thus a contradiction in terms Thus mathematics ends in meaninglessness

if the root 2 diagonal stops that means root 2 stops-which is not the mathematical case

and

you end in contradiction

you admit that root 2 is an irrational number

Godels theorems end in meaninglessness

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/book-genre/poetry/

shows Godels 1st and 2nd theorems shown to end in meaninglessness

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/GODEL5.pdf

Godels 1st theorem

“Any effectively generated theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete. In particular, for any consistent, effectively generated formal theorythat proves certain basic arithmetic truths, there is an arithmetical statement that is true,[1] but not provable in the theory (Kleene 1967, p. 250)

but Godel cant tell us what makes a mathematical statement true,

thus his theorem is meaningless and the Science Magazine claim is nonsense meaningless

even Cambridge expert on Godel Peter Smith admits

""Gödel didn't rely on the notion of truth""

thus by not telling us what makes a maths statement true Godels 1st theorem is meaningless

so that shows the ""Science Magazine"" claim:""Kurt Gödel—Separating Truth from Proof in Mathematics"" is nonsense as Godel cant tell us what truth is and there cant have been a ""Mathematical Breakthrough""

and for some relish

Godel uses his G statement to prove his theorem but Godels sentence G is outlawed by the very axiom of the system he uses to prove his theorem ie the axiom of reducibility -thus his proof is invalid,

Godels 2nd theorem

Godels second theorem ends in paradox– impredicative

The theorem in a rephrasing reads http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems#Proof_sketch_for_the_second_theorem

The following rephrasing of the second theorem is even more unsettling to the foundations of mathematics: If an axiomatic system can be proven to be consistent and complete from within itself, then it is inconsistent.”

or again

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems

""The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.""

But here is a contradiction Godel must prove that a system c a n n o t b e proven to be consistent based upon the premise that the logic he uses must be consistent . If the logic he uses is not consistent then he cannot make a proof that is consistent. So he must assume that his logic is consistent so he can make a proof of the impossibility of proving a system to be consistent. But if his proof is true then he has proved that the logic he uses to make the proof must be consistent, but his proof proves that this cannot be done

note if Godels system is inconsistent then it can demonstrate its consistency and inconsistency

but Godels theorem does not say that

it says

""...the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency""

thus as said above

""But here is a contradiction Godel must prove that a system c a n n o t b e proven to be consistent based upon the premise that the logic he uses must be consistent""

But if his proof is true then he has proved that the logic he uses to make the proof must be consistent, but his proof proves that this cannot be done

I honestly do not care about this model, in fact I would prefer this vs building up your engineering experience from outside.)

Now my question is, if you are given an offer to work for either companies, which would you choose, Tesla or SpaceX? Both promising companies with very very bright future ahead that will be leading its respective industries.

My first job out of college and I am one of the 2 mechanical engineers there. My senior engineer told me we need to start making thermal flow simulations on solidworks for the electronic boards to observe the internal temperature of the components and heat sink but neither of us have much experience with simulations. And to verify our results from the simulation, we want to do thermal testing on the actual boards to make sure we are on the right track with the simulations. I know people turn their noses down on Solidworks Simulation but unfortunately I don't have any say in that.


My main questions are (I apologize if they are dumb):

-what are the parameters I need to input on flow simulation and how can I get them

-aside from the board, what other material(s)/software do I need (i.e. thermocouple?) to conduct an actual thermal testing (outside the simulation)

-recommendation for any resources I can use throughout (for setup, equations I need to use, etc)

 -how long did it take you to pick it up?

Whether anyone reads this (due to its length), it feels good to put it all out there.      
That being said, my post:   
I've grown up in a small town in Missouri, the bastard son of a signal teenage mother who never married my father.  I'm in my mid-30s and thus was born in a time when deadbeat dads could get away with not paying child support, mine never did. We were poor. Add to that a string of drug issues my mother had in my early life and you can begin to understand how I and my half-brother found our way into the care of DFS. By the end of that, I would be taken in by my grandmother. My bother, on the other hand, wouldn't be my brother anymore (given up for adoption).   

  
My grandparents weren't like my mother ( who would later go to college and improve), they were hard-working upright middle-class folks. They raised me, as essentially, their third child.  I would eventually come to live with my mother again. Now improved she had an associate's degree and a job, but still couldn't make enough money to support us.    

  
It had become apparent that I struggled in school and so a round of progressive actions was taken. LD classes were followed by DB ones, and finally, the IEP's. These were seen as a good thing at the time, a way of lowering the standards for those children who couldn't ""keep up.""  What it really meant was that I was learning pre-algebra as a jr in high-school.   
Somewhere in the mix, I was put on minor disability by my mother, who despite me saying it was shameful, saw it was a way to supplement our low income and make a better life for me. I told myself at the time that I wouldn't stay on it after I became an adult, but when the time came, the security of it was too much to give up. I'm not proud of it, but there it is.  

   
I stayed on the check until 23 when a drunken fight on someone else's property landed me in jail. Although no one was really hurt I pled guilty to 2nd-degree assault (in MO a non-expugnable crime) in exchange for getting to go home that day and walking 3 years probation. I've never been drunk or violent before in my life, but, the one place I messed up would end up following me for the rest of my life.

     
When I began to explore how to rebuild my life I found most things out of reach. Felons, I learned cannot hold office, be a lawyer, work in the medical field, etc. One thing I kept coming back to was computer science, however.  I was told time and again that CS was the way to go if you had a record. That field was in such demand that many companies couldn't afford to care too much.   With all of my learning issues, I poured myself into learning this stuff. I started again at basic math and worked my way up ( as a grown man) to calculus. I did whatever I had to do to pass my classes. In this time I met the love of my life, inherited a home, and thought I was working my way toward something, a real life. It has taken me 7 years to get a 4 year CS degree.   
Now, the year of graduation, I find that my education has not given me everything I need.  I've no working knowledge of React, Angular, or really any framework outside of .net. I've no portfolio, nor the knowledge of Git or modern frameworks to make one. It would take me months or weeks to learn even one of these frameworks enough to make me competitive and even then, my age and record conspire against me. 

 COVID has robbed me of the one job I had (a web dev for a very small company), destroyed the economy that made me even remotely hirable, and now, my grandfather (essentially my father) lays dying of the same illness in the ICU.  To make matters worse, I now see that there is very little in this town for me. I, a diabetic, live in a hotspot area. And the board of health tried to pass a simple mask mandate last night, only to be met by throngs of protesting anti-maskers. Living in fear of my neighbors and the virus is not the way I want to live.  

 My dream? Go to Colorado. They have a 7-year rule there, and my record won't be such a big deal. Of course, to go I would need a job, and to get one I'd have to be competitive.  Which, I'm not.  The whole thing is just so much. Such a long journey and I'm still not even close to where I want to be. I'm tired...The whole mountain just seems far too high to climb.  It really hurts to know I've come all this way only to fail.

Because of the cost (wood is crazy expensive right now), slope of the build site, and difficulty with getting large machinery in, I'm planning a pier &amp; beam foundation. I've done a ton of research, but I can't seem to lock in the correct pier spacing and span for the beams.

My current plan would have 8"" diameter, concrete piers running 36"" deep (code for the area), with wider bases. On the 16' length, three piers (8' between), and on the 20' length four piers (6.6' between).

For the three 20' beams, I plan to use grade 2, pressure treated, southern pine - 2ply 2x8's. According to the span table [here](https://www.decks.com/how-to/40/beam-span-chart-table), they should be sufficient to span the 6.6' distance between piers, if the floor joists are spanning 8'. For floor joists, I plan to use the same lumber in 2x6. According to the span table [here](https://www.mycarpentry.com/joist-span-table.html), those should be sufficient to span 8' with a 40psf live load.

I'm a biology major. I'm doing my PhD at the moment. Like the title says I'm trying to build a Multitouch display to solve a tracking problem. I will summarize some characteristicis of the worm to give you guys some idea.

I work (or at least used to before covid) with a 1mm (0.4 inches) worms. They usually are in the mud but can be handled and raised in a lab without a problem. The thing is they use chemical traces in the environment to track down larger worms (their food, they are about 2cm-0.78 inches). We tend to do experiments where we put both worms in acrylic boxes and we watch how the tiny worm orientates and tracks the larger worm.

This is a tedious task because I do it by staring at the acrylic boxes for a whole hour ish, I can watch 2 or 3 at a time. So I want to improve and maximize my time when all of this is over.   
At first I thought about using an old Motorola G4 screen but the worms are so tiny and dont even do any pressure or conduct any electrical charge. Since this didnt work i didnt even think about a resistive screen.

Searching for ideas I came across a lot of optics based screens. LLP caught my attention since I dont have to use any camera behind the display, unless I'm testing if the LEDs are working (or at least that is what I understood) and is relatively cheap.  
For anyone wondering what is LLP is basically this: infrared lasers diffract and shine lasers all across a surface and when something breaks that surface, the object lights up. What sees this lighting up (and can then use the data accordingly) is an infrared camera pointed at the plane. But since i dont want to use a camera i was thinking about an array of photo sensors. Or you can watch this video:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player\_embedded&amp;v=ooZlsIlglqk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=ooZlsIlglqk)

Since the worms are SUPER small I'm wondering if this can work. I mean, as seen in the video, a finger is fine for the laser to track, but with a tiny worm it makes me wonder.

So, my question(s) is: since i don't want to throw money away in something it wont work, does anybody know if this can track objects that small. If not, is there any type of screen or something that I could use to track this tiny worms?

I know there is commercial (and expensive) tracking devices as used in C. elegans, but I want to try to build my own idea.

And secondly, sorry for the long post. This wasn't meant to be this long, but now it is.

As the title states, I recently graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering and a concentration in Aerospace in May of this year. I had an average 3.4 GPA, and I never was able to get an internship – or an engineering job for that matter.

I gave up searching for jobs just last month, and I am wondering now what I can do in the meantime to practice what I've learned in school. I have been working a side-gig full time in the meantime, and I am planning on taking the FE exam in the near future, so that's already fewer things to worry about.

\---

I have a budget (that I am currently working on building) of about $1,500 (USD) max for a project or a set of projects. The project(s) can be Mechanical/Aerospace/Computer Engineering or Computer Science related. I don't have many shop tools at my disposal, so I would have to buy some tools as well.

I've worked on circuit-building, mechanical design, CAD, manufacturing (machining, CNC, welding, etc) and on aerodynamics of aircraft. As for code, I know MATLAB, Python, and C++. I also live in a large city in the USA and just got my first car, so I have mobility and should have ease of access to most materials.

\---

As for advice, what should I do during this pandemic? My mom keeps telling me to go into graduate school now while I'm still fresh out of college. I've heard from others that now is the best time for me to get into grad school, be it the pandemic, just the mere fact I would still be in the school mindset, or for other reasons. To be honest, I would go back to school if it wasn't for the fact I have student loans to pay off and that I would have to scramble to find three recommendations just to apply to a school. I would probably end up paying $2,000 a month for loans (including my new car loan) on top of tuition and rent if I were to go to school again.

On the topic of finances, I know most people actually go to grad school as part of a job benefit, so is it also true that scholarships for graduate studies are scarce since you're expected to be a working adult by then? And what are fellowships like? I know some grad students use these instead of scholarships.

Instead of going to grad school (or in addition to) are there any \*useful\* (engineering or otherwise) skills I should pick up while I wait for the pandemic to be over? I've looked through many online course sites ([Lynda.com](https://Lynda.com), [coursera.org](https://coursera.org), [edx.org](https://edx.org)) , but so far all I can find are programming, management, Six Sigma, video editing, creative writing, LEED certification, and CAD tutorials.

I already know CAD; I've used it on multiple projects during my undergrad. I'm not planning on designing buildings, so LEED may not be useful to know. Six Sigma keeps getting thrown around, but its usefulness is always debated. I'm not going to get started on creative writing. Project management seems to be useful enough, so I've started that.

\---

I would like to keep applying for jobs, but the severe lack of responses to all the 60 applications I sent in the two months before quitting was quite honestly disheartening. I may just put it on pause until the pandemic is over or until I hear things are going better for recent graduates.

That brings me to another point. Are we expected to know anything? Every time I apply to a job I feel stupid. I'm not going to lie here and say I know some things, because I really think I don't. I only know what I was taught in school, and to be completely honest, everything I see on job listings looks like a bunch of mumbo jumbo. Maybe it's the lingo/jargon/slang, but I have no idea what most of what appears on a job listing is. I see posts here on this very subreddit about this same topic, and I don't know if y'all are joking or if we really don't know what we're doing until 50+ years later.

\---

I don't come from an affluent family or a family with members that have gone to college, nor do I know any real-life engineers, which is why I am posting this here. I would like to know what it is real engineers do and how they think, so that I don't feel surprised when I enter the workforce if at all.

Thank you for taking the time to read all this!

\---

TL;DR:

Need a list of potential projects / good sites with ideas.

Should I go to graduate school, apply for jobs, etc?

What skills should I learn?

I feel dumb reading job listings. Is that normal?

Thanks for taking the time to help out. I’m a bit stuck and really just need a pros help.

I’m trying to match a filter to a fan for a homemade flowhood. These are used in mycological applications but so far it’s proving to be a headache since advice/forums/message boards all seem to use different terminology/units of measurement depending on where you are. 

My goal is to achieve at least 100fpm at the face of the filter. This would be about 0.5m/s. I’d like to work in metric, but it constantly changes between the two systems depending on who builds the fan. 

So, this is my current problem.  

I require 0.5m/s at the filter face.  To get the volume I found the area of the filter to be 61cm*30.5cm. This is 1830cm3 or 1.83m3. I multiply 1.8 * 0.5 and get 915m3/h or 15.25 m3/m. 

Using the resistance of the filter given at that flow rate in the spec sheet attached, the resistance is about 90pa for 0.5m/s (assumed as they just put title). 

Using the fan curve of the attached fan spec, the 900m3/h fan doesn’t have the guts to provide 0.5 m/s of airflow. This fan is only suitable to provide just under 600m/3 with that pressure drop.

However, my problem is I’ve got the fan and filter and it seems to work fine. It nearly blows out a match when I put one infront of the filter and my cheap anemometer reads higher than 0.5 m/s. 
What am I missing? What the hell don’t I get? I’ve gone over this a dozen times and it’s not getting me anywhere. Any help I’d be incredibly grateful.

I have seen analyzes done in papers and they always use estimation formulas that include the operation of the equipment, among them the performance of the engine-wheel power transmission and the transmission performance of the combustion-wheel power.

The manuals provided by the company do not provide the aforementioned data, but by papers focused on high tonnage trucks (CAT 789C) indicate that the **engine-wheel power transmission performance is 95% and the combustion-wheel power transmission performance varies between 16-20% using diesel fuel.**

**Are these percentages of power transmission effective for low tonnage trucks (20 ton to 30 ton)? If not, do you have any percentage of work for these?**

To calculate a consumption rate I am using a study carried out by the Australian government's energy department, where based on the rimpull used to overcome a hypothetical scenario (Rolling resistance 3.5% - Percentage gradient 4.5%; CAT 789C truck with load density 2.4 t / m3) added with the transmission performance of engine-wheels (95%) and combustion-wheels (25%) and use of diesel fuel, a fuel consumption rate can be calculated in L of fuel / second

I did mechanical engineering tech and have been working mostly in marine systems design for 7 years. I’m currently on a contract with a exceedingly nice rate. so I have the chance to go back to school or do something else with my life.

Originally did my Mech tech in Newfoundland and from what I can tell my diploma doesn’t count for shit in any universities except lake head. But i can’t see myself ever going there. I’m 28 now, considering doing a bachelor in mechanical from scratch. But I don’t know if it’s going to be worth the transition and four years of my life. I know you’re never too old, but if there’s minimal change between the two then it’s a pointless trade off.

I have a friend who’s just doing his PEng exam and he’s telling me about running the r&amp;d departments and how great his roll is in the company and all the interesting things he’s got going. But at the same time he’s telling me not to go back to school because it’s all about the money and it’s not worth the time because I have my Mech tech. But I don’t have a degree, I can’t just go get a masters or a second degree in business management or anything. I have to start from scratch to get anything but a btech.

My girl is applying for med school in Australia so if I do even get accepted I’d miss the chance to live my best life in Australia and we’ll more than likely just separate. Unfortunately I can’t see any future in design for myself, I feel like I need something more interesting. But I’m also worried that I’ll give up 4 years of my life, my relationship, and jump in to my 30’s with student debt just to be disappointed with an engineering degree and feel the same way I do now.

Fundamental parameters of the G-M method:

✓ An independent span of length L. 

✓ Width 2b. 

✓ Number of longitudinal beams ""n"" with span L and spacing b1. 

✓ Transversely we have a 2b staff and L1 spacing. 

(See figure 1)

The steps to follow: 

a. It is assumed that the Poisson's ratio ν = 0, the transverse modulus of strain: (G) become equal to E / 2. 

b. It is assumed that the slab plays the role of bracing a 1m strip. 

c. Determine the moments of inertia IP and IE respectively for the beams and spacers

d. Determine the moments of inertia of torsions KP and KE respectively for the beams and spacers. 

e. Find the flexural stiffness ρP = (E × IP)/b1 and ρE = (E × IE)/L1 respectively for beams and spacers.

f. Find the torsional stiffness γP = (G × KP)/b1 and γE = (G × KE)/L1 respectively for beams and spacers. Thus we will be able to determine the two fundamental factors of the method of G-M: 

1-The coefficient of torsion α = (γP + γE)/ 2x√(ρp × ρe) The parameter α responds to moments of inertia and torsion. If α = 0, the resistance to torsion is zero and if α = 1, the bridge is considered to be isotropic, i.e. it represents all the same properties in all directions. In our structure α is between 0 and 1.

2-The bracing coefficient θ = b/L × (^4√(ρp)/(ρe))

The weaker the bracing, the more flexible the structure, the more θ will increase. 

The narrower the bracing, the more rigid the structure, the more θ will tend towards 0. 

For values of θ &lt;0. 3, one will adapt the method of Courbon. In our case θ will be greater than 0.3.

P: 84:

Determination of the transverse distribution coefficient: 

The CRT is symbolized by: (formula: fig 2)

Pi: sinusoidal load applied to the bridge. 

K: the coefficient determined by G-M 

n: the number of beams. 

Coefficient K depends on: 

a. From the torsion parameter α 

b. From the bracing parameter θ 

c. The eccentricity of the load: e 

d. The y-coordinate of the considered beam: y 

For any parameter of torsion α, the interpolation is not linear. So calculate it by Massonnet: K (α) = K0 + (K1-K0) × √α 

A linear interpolation is allowed at the level of θ. 

K0 and K1 are determined by the hyperbolic equations in the appendix

To find K, we must draw its line of influence K (e) as a function of the loading position e. Road loads are placed in such a way as to produce the most unfavorable effect. Distance occupied by this loading is called Li. 

The coefficient K or Ki is determined by the following equation: 

(figure 3)

AL: the load of convoy ""q"" 

LAL = Li, width of the convoy load. 

ωAL: surface generated below the line of influence of K (e) 

Results: 

Proper weight : 

Rib: (n) Area of the equivalent section of the rib Acn: 1.143 m2 

Density weight of reinforced concrete: 2.5 t / m3 

Uniformly distributed load p.p: 1.143 × 2.5 = 2.86 t / m

P: 87:

Due to traffic loads: (G-M method), the basic parameters are as follows: 

L = 36 m, L1 = 1m, 2b = 10.6 m, b = 5.3 m, b0 = 2.12 m, number of beams n = 5 

Mechanical characteristics were noted at the level of the section located at mid-span with slabs: 

Moment of inertia of the rib: IG, p = 0.944 m4 

Torsional inertia of the rib: Kp = 0.0172 m4 

Moment of inertia of the slab: IG, E = (0.25^3 × 1)/12 = 0.001302 m4 

Torsional inertia of the slab: one calls on the theory of the membrane: 

(figure 4)  

To determine the parameter K (b / a), we admit the expression of Saada: Now we have that a = 0.25m and b = 1m where K (b / a) = 0.28104 m4; KE = 0.281 × 1 × 0.253 = 4.4 × 10-3 m4.

We can deduce: 

ρP = E × IP b1 = 0.445 × E 

ρE = E × IE L1 = 0.001302 × E 

γP = G × KP b1 = 4.05 × 10-3 × E 

γE = G × KE L1 = 2.2 × 10-3 × E 

The main parameters are as follows: 

The coefficient of torsion α = (γP + γE)/2√ρp × ρe = 0.11 

The bracing coefficient θ = b/L × 4√(ρp/ρe) = 0.63 

As θ&gt; 0.3 then we will use the method of G-M. 

Calculation of the distribution coefficients: A) At the level of the edge beam: 

The parameters K0 and K1 are determined according to the hyperbolic expressions. Their values are found in the appendix. 

For the torsion coefficient α = 0.11, the parameter Kα = K0 + (K1-K0) × √α = 0.668K0 + 0.332K1 

The position of the edge beam at for y = 4.24m 

Therefore we obtain the coefficient Kα depending on the position y of the beam, on the position e of the loading and the parameter θ.

So, I have been in my new role as a Sales/Support Engineer for almost 2 months.

5 weeks in my boss left to work for a family company, leaving me as the only technical person in my position. Our applications engineers are taking some parts of his role and people have taken over some of the small tasks.

However, necessarily, my role is shifting and I am taking on greater responsibility.

In my view this is reason to seek higher pay. The current plan is, instead of replacing my former boss, to higher someone less technical with more support exp who will be similar in level to me.

I'm thinking I should ask for a formal review at 3mo so that my request happens before the new person is hired or could get up to speed (I have lots of leverage as I've worked hard to onboard myself quickly).

Some comments I've gotten:
-i'm onboarding faster than any of the others who've held the role
-i seem to grasp the tech well/quickly
-sales guys like me &amp; are very happy with how communicative I am with them
...And other such things indicating I am excelling in the role.

I live in high CoL but the job is in a mid/low CoL area. Got the job in COVID and took what I could get, and love it.

I'm renovating my 1900's house and the only layout that makes sense ends up with a stacking washer/dryer on the other side of the wall as a large format tile shower, and just a few steps away from a bedroom. I want to prevent as much vibration as possible from shaking the house and the shower for all the obvious reasons.

The location is on the ground floor with an unfinished basement below, against an exterior wall. Also the room already has a newish strapped and leveled plywood subfloor over the original subfloor, raising it about 3 inches in that location, which allows me to cut out a square and build from the original subfloor if needed.

Currently I'm thinking of reinforcing the floor from below with extra bracing between joists, cutting out the washer sized square from the top subfloor, leveling that location, then building a concrete pad on top of the rubber matting (or legs or something). The washer would go on that.

Is this insane? I don't care about overkill. Will this even work? I'm thinking the extra mass of the concrete would help dampen the vibrations. Should I skip the rubber part? Does anyone have any ideas to toss in for fun?

I work for a Hot Strip Mill  as a maintenance supervisor and the reason why I ask this is because I\`d like to improve my general knowledge on centrifugal  pumps and increase my troubleshooting abilities and improve pump reliability but I still have some doubts and I was hoping you could help me understand on this topic.

This is the operating sheet of one of my High pressure centrifugal pumps:

[https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjZ0121a7YFQnHoP\_CDI5boaVVID?e=x9ii42](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjZ0121a7YFQnHoP_CDI5boaVVID?e=x9ii42)

[https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjZ0121a7YFQnHteviYjQx-8HpWF?e=LmcVu5](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjZ0121a7YFQnHteviYjQx-8HpWF?e=LmcVu5)

The NPSHr curve just for 3582 rpm.  


I  know that NPSHa is inherent to the system and its configuration and  that it is made of ""Static head, friction loss, vapor pressure, velocity  pressure and atm pressure) in other words is the pressure acting on the  liquid. (It represents the total pressure at the pump suction) I know  that the NPSHa changes with flow because of friction losses, so the more  flow the more losses in the suction head. This suction head can also be  affected by a reduction of flow. 

NPSHr is the minimum pressure head that must be present in the suction eye impeller to prevent the pump from cavitating. 

According to my pump sheet I have;

NPSHa of 50.72 m and NPSHr of 7.786m.

If  I understand correctly the NPSHa is the one that I can see in the pump  suction pressure gauge and the NPSHr is the one that I can see in the  pump characteristic curve so I must not let my NPSHa goes below my NPSHr  to avoid water reaching its vapor pressure and cavitation occurs.

NPSHa &gt;NPSHr  


My  doubt is that the Pump operating sheet shows that the pump works at  35°C but when checking on the water phase diagram the temperature for vaporization to occur at the NPSHr specified in the pump operating sheet  is almost 80°C.

What I mean is for a NPSHr of 7.786m, the temperature for the water to start boiling is almost 80°C

Where;

NPSHr=7.786m = 75.9Kpa at 80°C to start boiling

Now for a 35°C temperature that would be my operating conditation, the pressure needed for water to evaporate is almost 3kpa.

Why would the pump start cavitating at a pressure of 7.786m if the operating temperature is 35°C and not 80°C?

Looking for advice.

Looking for some input and advice on finding my next job.

I am an aerospace engineer 3 years out of college who moved halfway across the country to LA for my first job (mechanical eng. position). I was layed off (due to 737 MAX shutdown impact on company) back in Q1, and COVID spiked immediately after. Company has had to do more layoffs due to that as well.

I have been actively applying for 4+ months, applied to probably 80+ jobs. 90% I never see a response. I have done phone screenings and first &amp; second stage interviews with a few companies and I have either been told they can't actually hire anyone, or been completely ghosted. I am on 4 companies in a row now that I have done 2+ rounds of interviews and been ghosted after being told i'll hear something in a few days. It's been months since some of these. No responses to emails, voicemails (I haven't even received a no!), they just drop off the face of the Earth. I am really frustrated, and I can't seem to understand why you would interview someone for 2-3 rounds and then blow them off and ignore all correspondence. I feel like I have a strong resume, good GPA (3.8+), and can communicate well during the interviews. I have been actively reaching out to recruiters for companies I am applying to on LinkedIn and that is how I have gotten many of the interviews.

I'm looking for advice on what to do next. The extra fed unemployment stops at the end of the month, so I feel pressed on time now. Being out of work for 5 months has been tough on a personal level as well, I am the type of person who would do 50+ hour weeks so this is a big shift feeling very unproductive. Relocation out of LA/OC area is not really an option due to S/O, etc.

I'm a degreed EE in my late 20's with around 3 years of experience. I found out yesterday that I'm losing my job at the end of July due to a restructuring. My wife and I had been dreaming about relocating from the Midwest to Washington D.C/Maryland/Virginia area for a little while now. So, this seems like as good a time as any to pick up and haul ourselves across the country.

My previous roles were all as a design engineer (or co-op student) at manufacturing companies - one made AC Drives, one made power tools, and one was an automotive OEM. I'm searching for EE Design Engineer roles in the greater DC area, but about all I see is MEP/Construction or Defense sector jobs; I don't know the first thing about these sectors, so not sure how I would sell my self in an interview even if I applied.

I'm thinking that I want to work at a manufacturing company of some sort, probably one that makes industrial or consumer products. Are there any niche industries in the Maryland/Virginia area? (For example, Wisconsin has a number of companies involved in outdoor recreation products, heavy equipment, or water quality). Any suggestions on how I might continue my search are appreciated.

Neutron Flux: 10^15cm^3/s
Pressure: ~1,000 psig
Surface Temperature fluctuation: 20°C-~650°C
Helium Embrittlement issues
Time: 60-80 years 





So I’m a Nuclear Engineer, and one of the projects I worked on in school was a Helium-Cooled fast reactor design. I was the head of materials and worked a bit with a PhD student who specialized in steels for Nuclear applications. The general Helium-Cooled reactor design is actually an amazing design. Very safe and potentially low cost. However, as the materials guy, I ran into the major issue. I needed a pressure vessel that could withstand a neutron flux around the 10^15 n/cm^3/s and was also to be resistant to Helium embrittlement, and could operate at a pressure of 1,000 psig and had a maximum surface temperature of around 650°C, and could handle cooling to 20°C when shutdown. This pressure vessel was also expected to last no less than 60-80 years. 

Initially, I looked into a SS-304 variant as SS from what I read was supposed to be capable of those kinds of temperatures, and is fairly resistant to Helium embrittlement, however after discussion with the grad student, he said that the SS304 becomes increasingly brittle under those types of temperature fluctuations and is further accelerated by the neutron damage. Another issue that arrises is the Ductile to Brittle Transformation temperatures actually move upward from neutron damage in any materials which contain nickel or copper, which is contained in most welds. What I ended up doing was choosing an A509 steel and slapping a cooling system on the Pressure vessel to ensure the walls didn’t exceed the ASME standard for temperature. But this caused issues with the efficiency of the plant and I didn’t know enough to determine whether or not this could last the minimum 60 years, although my DBTT equations “said” it could. At the end of the design, the grad student applauded my section for being the one of “closest to feasible designs of that style of reactor that he has seen.”

Something I learned from the whole experience is that when it comes to materials, most of the engineering lies within the actual testing phase and you can only calculate so much.

So my question is. Is anyone currently researching steels in this category and have there been any new technologies or new materials developed recently that allow these metals to deal with insane conditions like the one this plant has.",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,186221.0,public,self,Materials Engineers.

6: 2x4 joist blocks, closest one transparent

7: hurricane bracket

8: post bracket (second one on far side hidden)

The rim and end joists are both hidden in the photo, but the rim joist sits on the end of the beam and also attached with a hurricane bracket. The hidden rim joist isn't supported by (1) but instead a couple of other horizontal and upward angled ""joists"" attached to ledgers on the side of the steps, running towards the house. The maximum supported length for this rim joist is then 56"" or maybe a little more, let's say 6ft.

Anyways, my [city's deck guide](https://winnipeg.ca/ppd/Documents/Brochures/Wood-Decks.pdf) says that for a max. supported joist length of 6ft, I need either a 2-ply 2x8 beam or a 3-ply 2x6 beam. Also, joists are allowed to be 2x6 as long as at 12"" joist spacing (that I'm using) and a maximum span of 10ft, which I don't exceed. The post has to be at least as wide as the beam, and I'm using 2 of them spaced 4.5ft apart (to both fit onto the step).

So in this 14"" vertical height, I have two options:

1) 2x6 joist on top of a 3-ply 2x6 beam, supported by a 6x6 post.

2) 2x6 joist on top of a 2-ply 2x8 beam, supported by a 4x4 post.

If you do the math, option 1 has a post height of around 3"", whereas option 2 has a post height of around 1.25"". I would prefer option 2 as the railing posts will be using 4x4's and I'd easily be able to use some offcuts for the post, rather than buying an entire 6x6 to only use like 6"" of it.

Problem with using the 4x4 posts is that I can't find any beam-to-post fitting that fits within that 1.25"". I guess I could just toenail it in, but that doesn't seem very secure to me.

I had also considered using option 2 but having some sort of concrete paver under the beam acting as a ""post"", but it would have to be exactly 1.25"" thick, something that I cannot find.

I am a MSc of Occupational Therapy (OT) student in North America with a BSc in Kinesiology, and I just finished 1st year of this 2-year MSc program. Although I still have a year left in the program, based on what I have experienced for the past few months, I have come to the conclusion that OT is very likely not what I initially thought it was (more on this later), and considering that we are in a pandemic which makes it a difficult time to find a job, I feel that staying and finishing the program outweighs the cons.

Plus, although my interpretation of OT may have been wrong or just partially wrong, there were things that excited me about OT initially (more on this later) and there is a part of me that feels that even if OT is not what I wanted it to be, I am hoping that I can find an OT related work or non-OT related work (by leveraging my OT Master’s degree) that I at least find somewhat enjoyable that can either:

1. **A) Become my final career goal if it MOSTLY aligns (if not fully) with the type of work I am seeking.**
2. **B) Be a career that can be used as a stepping stone to help me reach the type of career that I am looking for (more on this later) because I do need to work after graduation in 1 year and support myself while doing things on my free time after work to get to where I want to be.**

I will be describing what I initially thought OT was followed with a **priority list of the type of work I am seeking.** While I realize that there may not be a job that 100% matches exactly with all of the things on my **priority list (more on this later)** especially if I don’t go back to do another undergrad\*\*,\*\* but I am hoping that in an age where things are constantly changing, I am hoping that someone out there may be able to help me. **So, if anyone has the time to provide guidance and/or (even better) to be a mentor on helping me on these following things, I would greatly appreciate it:**

1. Help me identify career(s) that MOSTLY (if not fully) fulfills my **priority list** **(more on this later).**
2. Based on my **priority list (more on this later),** I laid out a few career options from my research (more on this later) so it would be really helpful if you could confirm if these options do MOSTLY align (if not fully) with my **priority list (more on this later)**
3. I researched some professional development certifications, but I’m not sure if these certifications are worth getting to help me reach the type of career I want. Some of these professional development certifications/courses are really expensive, so I would love your help in getting direction and confirmation on which of these I should invest in (e.g. certificates, workshops, continued education courses, diploma program, 2nd part-time Masters) to reach the type of work I should get into that meets the **priority list (more on this later)**
4. And also, any direction in what kind of placements could be useful (e.g. doing a neuro placement and use this as leverage in being knowledgeable about neuroscience) would be helpful.

Before I get into my **priority list,** I wanted to mention that if anyone is wondering why I am seeking help from others is because I feel that I’ve done as much as I can the past 6 months on making a career plan (reflecting on what I want, researching potential career paths, doing career/mental counselling, looking up people’s LinkedIn, looking at job descriptions, and doing informational interviews with other professions outside of OT), but I feel that I reached a lot of dead ends on creating a feasible career plan (e.g. if a career path even exists, identifying a career path, if certificates/continued ed courses/2nd Masters would even be helpful, if there is even demand and so is what I am doing worth the investment) so I thought I’d try seeking help.

While I have a general vision of the type of career I want (more on this later), I reached a lot of dead ends in **finding a feasible career** and a **feasible career plan** without doing another undergrad. Thus, in wanting to do something that aligns MOSTLY (if not all) with my **priority list, I need a feasible career plan** **(e.g. what professional development to do, what placements to try, what OT or non-OT jobs to apply for) for these time periods:**

1. **Right now to in approx. 1 year when I graduate the OT program**
2. **Then, when I start applying for jobs**
3. **Then when I do start working, I'm hoping to make a career plan of what I could be doing on my free time**
4. **what I could be doing on my free time to beef up my resume (e.g. doing a 2ndpart time masters)**

I know that making a long-term plan may not be easy, but I feel like I need to know that I am investing in something that will be worth the investment because right now, I don't really have a plan.

***My wrong impression of OT, what is the type of work I was originally hoping to do (this is finally describing the “more on this later”):***

Basically, when I was initially researching about OT, I read a lot of descriptions like “OTs adapt and modifies the environment” followed by reading articles like this where I encountered **environmental modification specialist (#6 on the list),** “OTs are creative and outside the box thinkers”, “OTs work with equipment and assistive devices/tech” to which I knew that OTs work with simple devices (e.g. adapted cooking knives) but I also thought that tech meant high-tech like prosthetics, robotics, different types of power wheelchairs, etc.

Based on how I interpreted OT before applying, I believed that OT is a branch of healthcare where we study a wide range of fundamentals of “hard/concrete” health science (anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, neuroscience, cognitive health science) and I thought that OT was described as “holistic” because we would study a range of health science fundamentals. Then, I interpreted that OTs use this fundamental health-science knowledge to understand a patient’s unique medical case (e.g. patient’s anthropometrics, understanding weaker side due to hemiparesis, patient’s brain injury, ergonomic and injury prevention, etc) and then start forming creative solutions by designing, developing, engineering, or sometimes prescribing products or technology to help provide patients a “tool” to help them become more functional to do what they need to do rather than the more physiotherapy’s scope of practice where they would use strengthening exercises/techniques and modalities to directly rehabilitate and treat the patient (this is what I thought was the main fundamental difference between OT and PT).

This initial belief of what I thought OT was felt extremely cool and to this day, **I believe a career like this is what I am looking for.** **Simply put, I believe I wanted a career where I more so put on an engineer/designer/developer hat and create solutions to help that patient.** I now realized that with my background in Kinesiology where I enjoyed learning about health-related science (e.g. anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, neuroscience) + my more black-white logical/fixer mindset (vs the more social, humanistic, and empathetic mindset needed in healthcare) + my fascination with high-technology + my desire to work with my hands to build and creatively design things led me to wanting a career like how I described. I now realized that this type of career that I was describing may be closely describing the role of biomedical engineers, rehabilitation/clinical engineers, product designers, or scientists. Maybe with the exception of product designers or “scientists”, I feel that becoming someone with the title “engineer” will not be possible unless I have an undergrad in engineering (except maybe software engineering), and again, while I do want to put on an engineer/developer/designer hat, I realize that I may not be able to fully be an engineer per say.

Although I realized now that I wanted to put on an engineer/developer/designer hat, I also did want my work to be meaningful and ultimately to help people which is why I initially thought healthcare was a good fit. However, by learning the hard way, I realized that being a clinician in a caring role really meant to be someone who is fundamentally empathetic, social, and extremely humanistic; to which I think my core personality/desire to be logical, creative, and hands-on like an engineer/developer/designer was what caused a disconnect from wanting to work in traditional OT settings or be a traditional clinical OT.

***So to make it clear, this is my ""priority list"" of the type of career I want and needing help shaping a career plan:***

1. 1st priority: To do work that hopefully has at least 1 if not all of the “hats” (engineering hat, developer hat, or a designer hat) --&gt; Ideally, I want work that requires understanding of health science fundamentals to then engineer/develop/design something for patients/clients/companies/corporations.
2. 2nd priority: Putting on these hats is a little more important so the 2nd priority is: “Work requires expertise knowledge of health science fundamentals like anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, neuroscience”
3. 3rd priority: I’m trying to identify jobs that has relatively good job market demand and is relatively stable (this is important as I do need to do work that is sustainable so I can support myself + future family)
4. 4th priority: I want the details of the job to logical/fixer type of job that ultimately helps people --&gt; To me, doing work that fits within my personality while helping people is meaningful to me
5. 5th priority: For the job to be decently to well-paying (Money is important but at the end of the day, I just need enough to get by)

***What career path have I looked into:***

Without doing an engineering degree and based on what I’ve been looking at for the past 6 months, the careers that checks off some of the **priority list** are:

1. **Product designers &amp; Product development** \--&gt; I’m not really sure how to become one. My thinking is that if OTs are truly someone who can “adapt the environment” and knows health-science knowledge, then my original thinking was that OTs could potentially be a product designer or product developer for variety of tools/equipment/products for wide range of companies.
2. **UX/UI designer** (A path I thought of: Learn digital designing skills through continued education courses --&gt; work for UX/UI for any company --&gt; If I still feel like I want to do something health related, apply for any health tech companies)

While these 2 options certainly have either one of the core skills of engineering, developing, or designing, but I feel like going in these 2 options is a hard road to go on (at least for right after graduation), which is why doing something more OT related may be in my best interest as a starting point.

* **I was wondering what your thoughts are on these areas.**

With that said, these are OT related careers that I think meets some of my **priority list**, so I was hoping to get your thoughts on the following career options, or get suggestions on other career options, what professional development to work on, and help me make a career plan if a career seems like it is up my alley:

1. **Assistive Technology Professional**  

   1. I see posts like this: [https://otpotential.com/blog/non-traditional-ot-jobs](https://otpotential.com/blog/non-traditional-ot-jobs)
   2. **I see that we can get ATP certification through RESNA (**[**https://www.resna.org/Certification/Assistive-Technology-Professional-ATP**](https://www.resna.org/Certification/Assistive-Technology-Professional-ATP)**) but this certification is expensive and I’m not sure what kind of career you can even get into**.
   3. Maybe work for a vendor company and perhaps use this to leverage into being more in a design/development role?
2. **Environmental modification specialist**  

   1. I’ve been told to do SCEM (Specialty Certification in Environmental Modification) certification
   2. I was told that these people help set up homes with Smart Home Technology but it is more so just setting it up and less so engineering/designing/developing, nor would it really incorporate an expertise on ""hard sciences""
3. **Working in something related to architectural firms to help design homes**  

   1. I’ve seen that I can look into CAP (Certified Aging in Place), and SCEM certifications, but again I don’t really know what they do and what kind of jobs to even look for
   2. I am assuming that there is an element of design here but is this really going to provide the work that I am looking for?
4. **Seating and mobility**  

   1. I know that this is kind of in the realm of using technology and making customized chairs so there is component of design here. I’m not sure if this field could be a stepping stone?
   2. I've been told this is an area of OT that requires expertise on those ""hard sciences"" and can use high-tech with variety of different seating technology so this could be something to get into?
   3. I also do hear that this is a dying field and getting a certification through RESNA may not be worth it.
5. **Bionic medicine (working with prosthetics and robotics)**  

   1. I was told some OTs work in these areas and that OTs work with engineers for research purposes. While the actual engineers would design products, perhaps this type of work could provide at least partially the type of work I am looking for (being a more logical work, incorporating “Hard/concrete” health sciences, working with high tech)

***Closing remarks:***

I tried to keep this as short as possible, but I did want to share exactly what I am seeking help with as clearly as possible while also showing that I have also done my homework too. I get if people may not understand how I even got here and think “why did I even choose OT”, “you wouldn’t be a good OT if you want to have an engineer/developer/designer hat on”, “why didn’t you realize what you wanted and switched your undergrad at an earlier time”. To all of that, I didn’t know at the time and this is something I have started to realize during the past few months or so, and I cannot turn back time so I have to work with what I have (plus being in a masters is still a blessing). To those who may feel that way, I understand if you feel this way but I respectfully ask that as I didn’t make this post to do an in-depth analysis of all of my life’s choices, I am hoping that if you have the time and are willing to help, that the conversation centers around helping me shape out a career path.

If anyone has the time and is willing to provide guidance and/or be a mentor in helping me out with my career planning, I would really appreciate your help.

I have a sculpture that is designed to rotate over 3 axes at max. 30RPM and is mounted on an aluminium disc. My plan is to use 3 of [these geared steppers](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/precision-planetary-gearbox/nema-17-stepper-motor-l39mm-gear-raio-501-high-precision-planetary-gearbox-17hs15-1684s-hg50.html?sort=p.price&amp;order=DESC) and secure the sculpture to the Z-axis shaft, but it's not quite clear to me how to (economically) secure the motors and the load to provide 3-axis movement. I see that the maximum radial and axial loads are around 150N, and because the load is around 8kg, I could perhaps save myself from using additional bearings and just rely on the bearings in the gearboxes. Is it correct that if the load is accelerated and decelerated slowly (&lt;1.88m/s^(2),) the 150N force limits won't likely be exceeded?

My current plan is to mount the Y-axis motor to the shaft of the X-axis motor using a shaft flange like [this](https://ozrobotics.com/shop/8mm-key-hub-18024-high-quality-universal-aluminum-hubs-are-key-locked/)

Similar for the Z-axis motor. However, the force ratings of these flanges are usually not provided. Also there doesn't seem to be a good way to limit axial movements of the flange. I've thought about using circlips, but I'm not sure if they have sufficient strength to resist a 8kg load.

Does anyone know of a good way (or a good reference) for providing 3-axis movement to a 8kg load? Is it reasonable to expect the bearings in the gearboxes to adequately support the load, given the 150N axial and radial force ratings?

Any advice appreciated.

**Current State**

When an employee is entering/leaving for the day, they wait in a socially distant line to have their temperature checked.

The employee steps into a booth which uses Seek Thermal's Seek Scan system to detect temperature. The temperature is displayed on the screen.

The employee steps out of the booth, tells the employee working the booth their employee ID#, and leaves.

The employee working the booth records employee ID#, time, and temperature (per the display) manually.

The Seek Scan software logs data (including time and temp) to a log CSV file. An entry is logged every time a temperature is measured, and each day has one CSV with all of its data.

**Desired State**

The employee scans their Employee ID (ours have barcodes and RFID, either could work but RFID would be preferred) at some point before/during/after their temperature is measured, and the Employee ID# is logged *with* the rest of the data for that particular measurement.

*The ideal output would be an excel file which contains the exact information output to the log CSV, with an additional column containing the employee ID of whoever the temperature reading was of.*

**Additional Considerations/Information**

I'm mostly having trouble with two parts of this issue: How to ""combine"" a log CSV with whatever format we log EID#s in, and how to associate the ID scan's timestamp with its automatically logged Seek Scan timestamp.

The nature of the log CSV file and software dictate that the program can not log data if the CSV is currently opened.

I'd expect there are instances where an employee measures their temperature twice by accident, and ID scanners would likely have the same issue.

I've thought about assuming values within, say, 10 seconds ought to be linked, but I'm not confident in the consistency of this option.

Thanks for taking the time to read. I'd welcome any suggestions on how I should approach this issue, whether it be through modifying our current process, me learning some VBA, or something else.

This seems like the right sub to post this question.

I recently found a way to cold brew coffee 90% faster by brewing it in a vacuum. Discovering t[his guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LB6ZzO8t9o)'s device introduced me to the idea, and I have been obsessed since. I have been able to mimic his device at home using a vacuum container meant to hold coffee beans. It works perfectly, but it produces very small amounts just like the linked device.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to make coffee this way at a much larger scale, but devices I've seen that do vacuum cold brew top out at about a half gallon per batch. I want to make 5-15 gallons at a time, and one day have my own shop. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is two fold:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How can I retrofit a brewing pot like [this one](https://www.coldbrewavenue.com/commercial-cold-brew-coffee-maker-deluxe-15-gallon.html) to hold a vacuum seal? 
2. I can post this in a food safety subreddit as well, but I might as well ask here too - are vacuum chambers like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CJLVYKY?pf_rd_r=GAXH55F22WXHQB2ZCWHF&amp;pf_rd_p=edaba0ee-c2fe-4124-9f5d-b31d6b1bfbee) food safe? The kettle part is a typical stainless steel kettle that seems food safe, but I don't know anything about vacuum pumps that use oil, and how it might taint the coffee while the pump is vacuuming the chamber. If anyone who works with those kinds of vacuum chambers could chime in, that would be awesome. Because if it is safe, I might just buy one of those and call it a day.

I encountered the Vortex shedding concept looking for an experimental way of creating an instrument. 

I got the concept more or less clear, but my studies are in the ultrasound department. Fluid dynamics is something new for me and I have the feeling I'm missing something basic. 

For a plan traveling at 800km/h, and an d= 1m, the Vortex shedding frequency would be around 160Hz, which makes sense and is something that I understand you want to avoid since the wavelength is close to the wingspan. 
Some resonance and we've a problem Houston. 

Based on my calculations, I should be able to create an vortex shedding frequency of 100Hz, using an object with an diameter of 1 mm. This is for an St around 0,2, and an estimated air velocity of  5m/s. 

Fv = St*v/d

Now, on paper this is amazing, but I don't think this held up in real life. I just realized that if this was true, swinging anything close to 1 mm of diameter at a medium velocity, should create low frequency sound. 

After swinging around some stuff, I realized that I must be missing something.

In this community, it seems, you can share your projects? So here is-himself made, himself and boasted. How to create an automated stand for measuring temperature and humidity.

**1. Structure. Connection diagram. Connection to the PC**

For our future stand we don't need to have laboratory accuracy readings. A sensor with a I2C HTU21D interface can be used to monitor temperature and humidity. It shows humidity with an accuracy of about 2% and temperature with an accuracy of about 0.3%. HTU21D is a good and cheap sensor.

Next step: we take the fork and connect PC/ plug in via Ethernet or WiFi.  
Connect the sensor as shown in the Figure.

 To read the data, we need to know the address and the I2C read commands.

• Address I2C 0x40  
• Temperature read command 0xE3  
• Moisture read command 0xE5

**2. Browser Search Bar Control**We need to set a GET HTTP request sequence to Fork with a specific query string. The commands in Fork are based on the principle «key = value» or just «key». Each query in the browser will receive a response from Fork. You can also combine queries using the &amp; symbol.

1. Start with I2C  
Provide the I\_MODE command value I2C  
[http://192.168.0.205/control?I\_MODE=I2C](http://192.168.0.205/control?I_MODE=I2C)

In the end we'll get I2C

2. Read the temperature in ASCII\_HEX format. For this purpose we will use two commands.  
*The first* G\_REQ\_RES\_FORM is to specify the format of the query and the response in value ascii\_hex.  
*The second* I\_I2C\_WRITE\_READ command is to generate a sequence I2C to the restart.  
Value - consists of a few bytes.

The result will be presented in the form of a sequence of bytes that the sensor has responded to.

&amp;#x200B;

|1 byte|1 byte|2byte|n byte|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Address byte|Number of bytes per record|Number of bytes to read|Data bytes to record/write |

 Here 's the request we got

    http://192.168.0.205/control?g_req_res_form=ascii_hex&amp;i_i2c_write_read=40010003E3  

In response to this request, we received ASCII\_HEX,69FC69

3. Let's read humidity data. Specified the format of the data and created a sequence for using the I2C. As with temperature data, but only the command for the sensor has changed.

    http://192.168.0.205/control?g_req_res_form=ascii_hex&amp;i_i2c_write_read=40010003E5  

Example of the answer of ASCII\_HEX, 2ADE29We got respond from the sensor.

Now we need to single out the temperature and humidity data we need. For temperature and humidity, the package is arranged in the same way and does not depend on the data bytes.

We will also need formulas to translate data. Unfortunately, in datasheet in formulas there is an error with the power of two, so I will write here corrected formulas.  
For temperature  
***Stemp*** \- sensor data, ***n*** \- number of bits of readings  
For humidity  
Overall as a result we received the following sensor readings

&amp;#x200B;

| 1 byte|\[7:2\] byte|\[1:0\] byte|1 byte |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| MSB|LSB|Status |CRC|

 Temperature: 25.89 ℃  
Relative humidity: 78%

**3. HTML Javascript page Control**

The actions in the previous paragraph are quite tiresome, and we don't have all day. Besides, I would like to have some interface in this case. Therefore we will make html page and automatic parsing on javascript. Here's what we've got.  
We turn on the I2C on the interface output by hitting ""init I2C"" button. And we use ""read temperature and RH"" button to send a command so we can immediately get temperature and humidity readings.  
We can also upload a page to Fork and ask directly from there. To do this, you will need to change one line in the code.

    var url_path 'http://192.168.0.205/ to      var url_path '/';      

And download the file using the file manager.

    http://192.168.0.205/file_manager  

Now to launch our interface we need go to

    http://192.168.0.205/user_example_i2c.html  

**4. Control via Python script**

Let's do the same now, but by using Python.  
First, we connect/plug in the fork module and create the target's device

    from forkapi.fork import Fork      dev1 = Fork('192.168.0.205')      

Then we also need to initialize the I2C on the interface input

    dev1.I2CEnable()      

Then give the command to our sensor and get the respond

    addr = 0x4      data = b'\xE3      res = dev1.I2CWriteRead(addr,3,data)      

As before, having carried out a number of transformations we get temperature and humidity readings. The result is displayed on the console.

I recently signed up for Progressive's snapshot program to receive a discount on my auto insurance. If you're unfamiliar, it essentially logs various bits of data that indicate how safe of a driver Progressive thinks you are. There are multiple factors it considers, but one of the biggest ones is monitoring ""hard braking"" AKA decelerating at greater than 7mph per s, or about 3.13 m/s\^2.

I was curious about how external factors might affect the accuracy of the device, and this got me thinking about how it actually works. It's just a little plug-in device that goes in the OBD2 port of your vehicle. A few guesses I have (that are entirely uninformed):

1. It somehow directly reads speed from your vehicle and does some simple computations to get your instantaneous accelerations
2. It has an accelerometer housed inside of it
3. It gets a live estimate of your speed using GPS and does simple computations for acceleration

I live in an area with a lot of hills, so if the device uses an accelerometer, I'm wondering if I'm supposed to drive differently to compensate for this. Assuming it doesn't somehow filter out static forces, this would mean letting go of the gas on a hill with a greater than \~18 degree slope would immediately log as a hard brake simply due to gravitational effects.

Just something I'm curious about -- I don't think I'll practically change my driving in response to this.

I am a 3rd Year undergraduate ChemE going into my 4th year this coming semester. I have the option to be transferred to a 5/6 year MEng ( Integrated Masters program w/ or w/o year in industry) or graduate with a BEng (Bachelors in Engineering) next summer and go do my MSc elsewhere.

The following are the MEng options

MEng:

1. MEng w/ Oil &amp; Gas w/ or w/o year in industry
2. MEng w/ Renewable Energy  w/ or w/o year in industry

I was wondering if anyone else had to make a similar decision or gone through either of the options and is willing to offer me some advice on the matter.  I know the choice is ultimately dependent on my career goals, previous academic record, finance, and work experience so I have listed some background information below:

**Career Goal:**

* The aim is to go up the management ladder in Pharma or Consulting.
* Want to move the US/Canada/Asia (Tired of the shitty weather in Scotland, United Kingdom)
* MBA is a possibility

**Work Experience (Relevant):**

1. Downstream Processing Intern w/ 3 Letter Pharma Giant **\[ 3 months\]**
2. Investment Banking Intern w/ IB firm who got caught smuggling cocaine **\[ 1 month\]**
3. Bioprocessing Intern w/ same Pharma giant in the USA  **\[ Rescheduled for Summer 2020\]**

**Academics:**

1. Year 1: 1st Class \[ Top 10%\]
2. Year 2: 1st Class \[ Top 10%\]

I have been at it for two weeks.

I have a couple of new Kohler engines with some 20-30 amp full-wave rectifiers on them for charging. Under most circumstances it charges just fine. When I put a load on it the DC+ (B+ lead on the Kohler rectifier) jumps from right at 14.08vdc to 14.41vdc +/-. The system is charging and working well. However when I turn on one particular transformer that is 12v and 8amps the engine stops charging. If I measure the DC output when I turn on that transformer I am lucky to get 12vdc. It commonly drops to the high 11vdc range. Not until I turn off that transformer does the rectifier return to the 14+vdc as per normal and then charging resumes. 

Here is the crazy part I have this EXACT same setup on 10 other units and I have no such issues. So I wired my new engine to the transformer on my current unit and got the same problem as described above. I wired my new transformer to the current unit and it works as expected and the unit charges. So the problem has to be in the engine and it’s charging system. But aside from the transformer the charging system is behaving normally. So next I wire up another new engine and it is behaving the exact same way. It is blowing my mind. I have been doing this since 2013 I know what I am doing but this one is kicking my butt.

Here are the particulars in case it is needed or is relevant;

· Kohler CH730-3226 manufacturer in Sept 2019 (10 other units 2016-2017 same make/model)· 

\-Rectifier Kohler 25-403-39-S (20-30 amp rectifier)

· Stator Kohler 28-085-02S Stator 25 amp

· Transformer Beckett 5218303U 12VDC Ignitor 

So in my infinite knowledge of electronics (not so much) I decided I am dealing with a ""noise"" issue as the transformer is a good deal closer to the engine and rectifier on the new setups, or I am dealing with a full wave vs half wave pulse issue. Don't ask me how I got there, and it is probably totally wrong but I am fresh out of ideas. All I know is I need help. I have tried the local small engine guys and they are stumped. I need some ""brain power"" to get behind this.

There is a group on another world that is made up of Humans and another race called Larrad (picture ewoks but smart engineer types.) and the Larrad have a ancestor worshipping religion that abhors waste. They believe to throw anything away is disrespecting the creators of something which relates to disrespecting god. Throwing something away is a sin, but using something up is a virture. Like if they knock down an old house they'd straighten the nails to be reused and the bricks might be put on a shore line for erosion resistance. If you burned old magazines to be rid of them that would be a sin but if there was a purpose, like cooking food or warming your house its ok. Also if you kill an animal and just leave it thats wrong, but if you kill it and eat it, thats fine.

Referring to the video above, I have a question.

At 00:57 in the video, the author says that ""the motor driver (shown as a DAC in the video) is given discrete voltage samples as input, and then the driver  is a \*physical piece of electrical hardware\* holds the voltage constant for the period between the samples.

**Q1.** Am I right if I think of the ""physical piece of electrical hardware"" as the PWM peripheral of the microcontroller followed by the gate driver and the inverter? 

Reason being -

1. The discrete voltage samples (say, Vcontroller) from the controller firmware are first converted into a duty cycle samples by a simple formula duty = Vcontroller/Vsupply. (Vsupply is the supply voltage of the inverter)
2. The duty samples are then provided to a PWM peripheral inside the MCU which will output PWM pulses (having frequency, say, 20Khz &amp;) having duty cycle equal to the value of the duty samples.
3. These pulses are now given to a gate driver chip which then drives FETs/IGBTs etc. in a H-bridge inverter.
4. The motor lines are connected to each of the legs of the inverter, which take the voltage from the inverter. And the inductive effect of the motor helps in averaging out the inverter output voltage.

 So basically the PWM peripheral along with the inverter does the DAC work including ZOH handling.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q2.** I want to model this DAC block in a S-domain, (like done in the video at 9:32). I was thinking of modelling it same like the pade approximation shown in the video, something like,

G\_inv = K/(T\*s + 1) 

where, 

T = 1/PWM\_frequency = 1/20KHz = 50usec

And gain K.

Is this correct?

&amp;#x200B;

**Q3.** I am confused with the K term. 

Is keeping a gain of 1 ok (like done in the video)? If not what should the gain be?

Is there ANYTHING special about a vacuum pump that makes it a vacuum pump. I am looking to make a 500 gallon vacuum chamber and I am trying to determine the right pump for the job.

Most of the little portable pumps have too low of flow rates plus I have read that the duty of those pumps is so low and they should not be ran for more that 30 minutes at a time. I don't want filling this tank to take 70 hours. BUT I am not interested in spending 1000's of dollars on a higher duty pump that is rated to vacuums I will never need. I need to be able to pull 26 inHg which is pretty dang tall, but nothing compared to some vacuum pumps.

I had found [these pumps](https://hydrocomponents.us/collections/rotoflow-fluid-o-tech-rotary-vane-pumps/products/pa-2500-clamp-mount-brass-71-91-gph-1-18-1-52-gpm-3-8-npt-small-miniature-rotoflow-fluid-o-tech-rotary-vane-pumps) which are much cheaper even though they still require a motor that will run $100-200. It's not a vacuum pump, but it is still a rotary vane pump like most of the vacuum pumps you can buy. Somehow it has better flow rate specs than most of the expensive vacuum pumps, but I don't know why.

Can I make a vacuum pump out of any rotary vane pump? The pumps can come set to take gas fittings, so I am sure they move air. Would the actual flow rate remain the same? And how would I know what the vacuum rating would end up being? These are rated for pushing 100-200 psi while 26 inHg is only 13 psi lower than 1 Atm.

I don't have access to any machine shop equipment, just regular power tools, and I imagine most rental/membership places are shutdown with COVID. Can be postponed if truly necessary but patience is not my virtue.

* Cheap (This is negotiable but there will be a point when it becomes cost-prohibitive)

Before I state the problem that I am having, I'm going to lay out what I've done so far. My current method is to keep track of the total mass of gas in the cylinder over time, by using both the changing volume of the cylinder to determine the changing cylinder pressure and the mass flow rate through the valve due to the pressure differential.

Below is my current strategy (I'll post a screen-cap of my excel sheet at the bottom).  


1. With the piston at TDC at the start of the intake stroke, I'm assuming that air at 1 atm &amp; 70 F already fills the clearance volume.
2. I increment the crank-shaft angle 0.5 deg and use the engine speed (const 2400 RPM) to step forward in time. 
3. I use the crank-angle to calculate the instantaneous gas volume (I can't find the equation online, but I've pulled it from [Fund of IC Engines by Pulkrabek](https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Fundamentals-Internal-Combustion-Engine/dp/0131405705/ref=sr_1_4?crid=21DFLCX0OW01X&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=internal+combustion+engine+fundamentals&amp;qid=1588129580&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=internal+combustion+engines%2Cstripbooks%2C157&amp;sr=1-4)) and I've verified that these calcs are correct.
4. For this first step, I've assumed that no additional mass has yet entered the cylinder through the valve, so I use the initial gas mass &amp; new gas volume to calculate a new gas density.
5. I assume that the gas expands adiabatically and calculate the new temperature &amp; pressure accordingly from the density ratio (i.e. (P2/P1) = (dens2/dens1)\^(spec heat ratio) ).
6. From this new pressure, I can use the difference between this pressure &amp; ambient to calculate a mass flow rate (see equation in the link below) - I've currently assumed that the flow is *not* choked. I've assumed a discharge coefficient of 0.65, and I'm currently neglecting compressibility factor.
7. Finally, these exact same steps are repeated but each time I use the previous mass flow rate &amp; the time step to calculate a new gas mass (m2 = m1 + massflow1\*(t2 - t1) )

&amp;#x200B;

The issue I'm having will become evident once you see my excel sheet - after the first calculation, the pressure immediately jumps to *above* ambient (row 3), which is obviously not physical...I've attempted reducing my step-size, but this does not appear to solve the issue - I personally think that the error lies with my methodology rather than my calculations. Am I missing something important here, or is it most likely that I'm performing a calculation wrong? I've checked the equations multiple times, but I suppose that there could still be a typo somewhere.

Thanks for your help.

Background: I am a mechanical engineer, early in my career (3 years in). I work for a very small company that imports and distributes power tools and other equipment in the United States. Those power tools include miter saws. A while back, a user purchased a saw we sold and subsequently hurt himself, alleging a blade guard defect. That turned into a legal case that is now moving towards trial.  

It is important to note that (1) this miter saw was certified by the CSA group, (2) to the best of my knowledge, my company had no input as to the actual mechanical design of this saw.

My company, of course, has insurance for this sort of thing. The insurance company hired a legal firm to represent themselves in court. Those lawyers been contacting me throughout the process. Two years ago, I met with said lawyers to go over the allegedly defective saw with them, as well as a nationally-recognized engineering expert on this sort of thing. My role in this was limited to explaining to the lawyers how miter saws worked, the various labeling and other design elements on the saw designed to mitigate or prevent injuries, etc., whereas the expert was the one responsible for determining a state of defect or tampering.  

My impression of these lawyers is that they are first and foremost lawyers, and do not have an engineering or design background whatsoever. Again, they are representing the insurance company, not necessarily my company (which is insured by said insurance company).

The reason this was done two years ago (and I, as a kid barely a year out of college, was sent to do this) was that I was one of two engineers at the company at the time, the other of whom is based overseas and does not speak English.

Two years later (i.e. now), the case is proceeding towards trial. Currently, my company sells a line of miter saws that no longer includes the saw model in question, as below.  

&amp;#x200B;

* Model 1 ---- 	manufacturer A ---- discontinued
* Model 2 ---- 	manufacturer A ---- discontinued, allegedly defective model
* Model 3 ---- 	manufacturer B ---- discontinued, but replaced Model 1
* Model 4 ---- 	manufacturer C ---- active
* Model 5 ---- 	manufacturer D ---- active
* Model 6 ---- 	manufacturer E ---- active  
 

All models are sold under the same brand. All are certified by regulatory authorities (UL, CSA, or ETL), but excepting models 1 and 2, all were/are designed and made by different manufacturers.

My understanding is that currently, the lawyers are basically wanting me to sign an affidavit stating that “as an engineer, I believe that models 1, 2, and 3 are the only ones substantially similar enough to each other so as to limit the scope of discovery to these 3 models”; discovery being each party’s obtainment of documentation or other evidence from the other party, to my understanding.  

Here’s the kicker, if you’ve taken the time to read this far (thank you!): many miter saws, in particular, are so similar in design to one another, regarding the blade guard mechanism, that it seems that to sign such an affidavit would be misleading. Of course, there are many other design differences, feature differences, etc. (not to mention the fact that these were made by completely different manufacturers) with models 4, 5, and 6, but not necessarily in the blade guard mechanism, which is (to my understanding) very similar across most manufacturers and brands across the world.

Obviously I’ll do whatever is ethically and morally right, but overall, I wonder if this has potential implications for my future career as an engineer.  Some more salient points:  

&amp;#x200B;

* I want to disentangle myself from this situation, and being so early in my 	career, do not feel qualified to be making those kinds of judgment 	calls, and (admittedly selfishly, perhaps) have no desire to see this create headaches for me down the road.  	
* I have no direct engineering superiors at this company (like I said, it’s 	very small), and so am not sure who to turn to regarding my situation. My direct boss is on the business side of things and has 	been trying to not get involved in this case as much as possible. Our COO, who is very experienced (60’s), has been handling things primarily.  	  
 

Has anyone ever experienced anything similar? If so, what did you do?

[Picture of how the house sits](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ACDWJydneGWTXLt4oI9OmxWldZCwS6YM)

Looking at buying a house built in the 50's, it has 3 large foundation cracks that were repaired. The inspector said they appear to be repaired very well. I'm asking seller for documentation on them.

House is built on the side of a large hill. The front yard is a steep drop off, then a (I assume) leveled out section where the house sits, and the back yard immediately grades upward. So, it sits in like a notch on this hill.

You'll notice that the small retaining wall out front has apparently moved downward.

Loam soil, has gutters and drainage, dry basement (inspected when wet out) but they do have a dehumidifier down there. The biggest and oldest looking crack is on the back side. My best guess would be the house used to not have gutters and water collected back there to cause the shifting.

I'm getting into building home arcade machines, and am trying to narrow down what I think makes a good button. Wether I'm kicking in Mortal Combat, or firing a million times in galaga I want a great button. 

I hate some buttons, they are easy to push with no moment at which you receive tactile feedback indicating the button push has registered. Others have clear feedback, you know you've pushed it. 

I'm hoping to document the differences in a measured way, rather than using wishy-washy feeling words. I'm imagining being able to show a graph with the distanced traveled on the X axis, and resistance the button presented on the Y. I could then add a vertical line showing where the button push was registered.

* Is there better language I should be using when describing the information I want to gather? (part of my problem could be that I don't know the right terminology to describe the data I want)

I'll place three of the questions that could help answer. This is by the way a question made by our professor himself and according to him barely anyone got the answers to this question. This question has also around 13 questions and I'm just providing three here.

**Questions.**

1. Find the Gauge pressure inside the tank, and also
2. The corresponding absolute pressure; assume that water level initially is at a column height of 32.815 feet.
3. Find the pressure difference inside the tank in absolute if the supply line adds 150 cubic meter of water.

**My personal Attempts:**

1. I know the Gauge Pressure formula for being ***Pg=mg/A***. I do also know it can be derived to ***Pg= density x gravity x height.*** Now this is my attempt answering Pressure gauge. Given that Liquid Density is water is *997kg/ m**^(3)*. Gravity is *9.81 m/ s**^(2)*. And height of the liquid in the tank is 32.815ft converted to 10.002m.     **Pg =** ***997 kg/m******^(3)*** ***x 9.81 m/s******^(2)*** ***x 10.002 m = 97825.26 Pa or 97.825 KPa***
2. My attempt on absolute pressure. **Pt = Pg + Patm** (atmospheric pressure). **Pt = 97.825 KPa +  101.3 KPa** (earth atmospheric pressure) **= 199.125 KPa.** I'm not entirely sure here because I used earth atmospheric pressure than the air left above the tank. I'm sure I'm not right but an explanation as to why I'm not would help me greatly.
3. I haven't tried to answer this, just want to make sure that this question states it added in **150 cubic meter** of water into the tank that is already filled with 10.002m of water. Converting 150m^(3) to meters it is 5.3133m, so the tank is now 15.3153 m filled. But isn't that .3153 extra from the figure? Tell me what I did wrong.

I know posting a question without attempts to answer is a butthole move so I tried and hopes anyone can explain to me what I did wrong or missed. Thank you!

This is a combination mechanical/chemical question but here it goes.

One of my colleagues is seeing mechanical seal failures at the agitator constantly. Like multiple failures on the same agitator in a single year. Her process is an aqueous based polymerization process with a film forming final product. Some of the products tend to foam. The reaction starts under vacuum and slowly pressurizes as the reaction proceeds (usually about 5 psi, max up to 25 psi) with temperatures usually at 140-190 deg F. 

Key points;

* The process fluid starts leaking out of the seal assembly when it fails.
* The failures have occurred at any point; whether vacuum or pressured up, beginning of reaction and end of reaction.
* It has occurred on multiple reactors of varying configuration and size.
* It has occurred over several grades of product; some particularly foamy, some not foamy at all. With that said, products are flip flopped in the same reactors.

I don't have details on their root cause analysis of the failures to see if they investigated which components in the seal failed. Their maintenance team says that it is because the foam is pushing into the internal seal (internal seal is dry since it is a top entering agitator) and drying creating friction on the seal faces. She did however tell me that their seal pots are oriented awkwardly where they charge them with glycol and then pressurize with nitrogen and then close off a valve to seal the pressure. The pressure isn't regulated with a backpressure regulated feed. There is no cooling to the seal pots. Unfortunately there is no instrumentation to read the seal pot pressure and temperature outside of local gauges.

Maintenace's theory makes sense but there should be some flow from the seal pot that keeps the internal dry faces lubricated under the process pressure. My thought is that because there is no continuous source of pressure on the seal fluid that it inevitably leaks. Once the pressure drops down enough, the process pressure overtakes the seal pressure and process fluid flows into the seal.

My recommendation to her is going to be; put a pressure indicator on the seal pot that goes back to the DCS to predict failures, put cooling water to the seal pots to eliminate heat variables, install redundant regulators that feed constant pressure to the seal pot(s), and if possible convert the more robust double cartridge seals for dry running or to contacting sliding seals. But before all that, she should probably get a vendor out to audit their installations because they don't seem correct.

We have limited n95 masks and it's impossible to find some more.

So I turned my old tiny grow box to a disinfection chamber and put an 8W UVC fluorescent lightbulb inside. 

[https://i.imgur.com/jEfqDvC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/jEfqDvC.jpg)

The idea is putting the n95's inside and disinfecting them, or maybe other small stuff.

Unfortunately, I have almost no experience with UVC lights and how they work so the first time I put the mask inside, I left it there for around 1 hour, and eventually masks straps split.

Could you make suggestions about the disinfection timing?

Also do you have any idea if this google protects eyes from UVC beams? I want to use this when i'm opening and closing the closet.

· How to deal with (non-religious) ethical and moral dilemmas while working in relevant industries?

· How not to be bothered by working for “dirty” businesses?

· Are all (engineering) companies only driven by money, profits, shareholders, etc.?

· Is there an industry and/or a discipline of science and engineering that has less of these issues?

· Are clashes with personal values good reasons for refusing to work in a given company or an entire industry?

· Should a person like this just stick with academia or e.g. consider using their skills in stuff like humanitarian aid instead?

· Will moving to a bigger country with a larger economy help in finding “meaningful” work?

Background of my education and career:

I am about to finish my more theoretical master’s in Materials Science and Engineering with my current major being Fibre and Polymer Engineering at the “top” institution for engineering in my country (small welfare country, small markets, mostly imported goods, etc.). I have some industry experience (research and \[product\] development, and production \[management\]) from e.g. Forest-Based, (Bio)chemical and Biotechnology Industries. Thesis has taken a very long time as it moved on from being application-focused towards more fundamental research (also due to the fact that I had to find a new job, i.e. working for my institution now as well), i.e. company (small start-up with venture capitalist involvement I think) wanted to take a shortcut and skip straight to productization.

I asked many questions about things that bothered me during our initial tests, but there was always a “convenient” excuse from the Chief Technology Officer and then Product Manager (now with a “higher” title, also my advisor from the company) on why we did things in a certain way. They also never revealed their “full plan(s)” to me, there was no written document or anything like that. Many decisions were made “on the go” based on either something they thought of, I discovered or mentioned, etc. As I was attempting to finish the writing process, I just could not do it. Obtained “proof” was way too “shaky” for the claims that we were making as in a lack of proper characterisation techniques and claiming that a not-fully understood natural phenomenon was successfully exploited in our researched application. There was also so much research data and calculations that there was a lack of real focus and such. Reached out to my supervising professor as we had kind of operated without involving him too much, hinted at my frustrations, etc. Whole situation was basically such that the company was doing quite a lot of marketing hype based on very limited testing as in calling it “revolutionary”.

I felt like I had been (somewhat) lied to this whole time with unrealistic promises of e.g. research article publications and so forth (I am interested in doctoral studies). However, when you are busy with executing time-consuming work, literature research, calculations, etc., you have less time to focus and think critically. They are still offering to cooperate in this journal article sense, but initial promises were “insane” as in being completely clueless about the quality and impact of our performed work. As if I, a mere student would indirectly solve how a natural phenomenon that scientists are still struggling with can be exploited in a manner that enables a practical application to function in a very “clever” manner by doing very limited and rudimentary yet time-consuming and massively data-generating experimental work. Like this was a classic case of “we have a result that we want from these tests by doing them and then we will publish it in a highly-ranked scientific journal to boost our company image”. They must have thought that I was a complete idiot or something, anyone with a decent brain would be suspicious of such claims. Alternatively they could be the idiots, I do not know at this point anymore. They seem like glorified salesmen to me now that I am looking back on all of it.

Moreover, while they were at least open about it and hinted about potential issues early on, I was only paid for six months and then there were “sudden” issues with company financials. I mean it could be true since they sort of seem desperate, but it is still very suspicious as in their plan was probably just to do some quick testing, exploit a student in some sense and then move on. So new tests are under development, etc., but coronavirus makes everything very complicated right now and I cannot continue laboratory work for a while. Mind you I am not a very trusting person anyways and something always bugged me about the whole affair. I do not know if people who do not really know me often assume that I am not the brightest person around or at least believe that I would be easy to manipulate as I am heavily introverted, keep to myself, focus on essentials, prefer to think things through, need time to process new information, etc. Like maybe the company people thought that they were dealing with at least a quite a young and naïve person. I am slightly older compared to how a “typical person” in a similar situation would typically be as I am already in my early 30s.

For some more context, my bachelor’s was more practical (Materials Technology) from a much less-known institution with a broad focus on different materials and personally specialised in Structural Design (Steel Structures) and Wood Materials during said studies. I had many difficulties in finding a thesis position, so I had to do a more private project for a contact from a previous summer job. Like e.g. one possibility for a company progressed somewhat, but then the person who was to confirm the position was being very evasive until finally telling me that there was no job. Economy of my country has also not fully recovered since the Global Financial Crisis and now a new one will likely hit this place really hard due to the coronavirus, etc. I as a young person (traumatised due to childhood and teenage bullying, clueless of my career interests, depression, etc.) struggled to find my place in all of this for five to seven years into my adulthood and it is still not easy even if I am more experienced and educated, more confident, not shy/socially anxious anymore, etc. nowadays.

I have only had short-term jobs overall, but at least they are from my field or a related one. It is also typical in my country to work during summer times when studying. At least I cannot focus on e.g. working on the side while doing full-time studying as well. While most of my other roles were more basic ones or at least less serious, I had a Production Management job that was basically me being in charge of an entire medium-sized mill (supposedly the largest mill on the entire planet for producing a specialty product) for a while so that the Mill and Production Managers could get their summer holidays. I was put in these shoes with a fairly short training and only two summers worth of working as a regular “grunt” in Production for a different company.

This job opened my eyes to how a typical “toxic” sales-driven company (owned by a private equity fund manager and company management) really operates. Production volumes and sales, i.e. profits were prioritised above all else. It did not matter if machinery was unsafe to use from time to time (e.g. there was a steam explosion inside the used process equipment with a boiler hatch firing out at a rapid velocity during a weekend, a real risk if someone had been at the wrong place at the wrong time since a minimal number of workers was used on weekends), regular proactive maintenance was skipped, work was so hectic that accidents due to personnel mistakes began happening with a really bad injury (an operator’s hand likely never fully recovering from what happened), there was missing safety equipment regarding potential danger hotspots, personnel with knowledge of processing equipment had been fired with no one having a full overview, etc. Only reactive repairs were done with me also having to make decisions between quick repairs to get production back to full functionality immediately or to do a proper check-up so as to potentially have more long-term benefits. As all members of Middle Management of the mill were seemingly afraid of losing their jobs and with Top Management being very controlling and power-hungry, I believe I made the right decision to turn down a more permanent job at that company. Like with bad luck I could have probably ended up in jail myself if I had remained in that place.

I only wanted to become a professional in science and engineering so that I could work in a development-oriented position(s) involving e.g. materials and product development, ideation, research, experimental and testing work, production scaleup, process optimisation, production management, etc. Took some courses also from related fields (e.g. Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Industrial Engineering and Management) since my field is very interdisciplinary. I have also studied relevant multidisciplinary fields so as to understand e.g. Business, Global Trade and Politics, and Economics better, but I do not understand why e.g. money has such a huge role in everything nowadays. To me it is just another resource that has been overemphasised compared to its original purpose which was to enable trade. Add very brutal, fierce and ridiculous competition on top of that and you have an engineer who does not want to work in the industries anymore.

In conclusion I am becoming very disillusioned and frustrated with my field at least in an industrial sense since I have witnessed some really strange and questionable business practices. I do not know how people from other engineering disciplines feel about these things, but I am becoming increasingly disappointed in the “real world” of engineering. It could be that since my master’s studies have had this “Circular Economy” and e.g. Climate Change as major underpinnings, I am expecting too much already with most industrial activity still relying on older, more linear business models. A lot of the more “ecological” solutions are practically marketing talk currently and it took me a while to snap out of these claimed progresses since “successful businessmen” from large corporations were giving us students all these amazing speeches of a “better future”. Yeah, even I was fooled for a while. I mean of course I somewhat knew that there is an increasing amount of greed involved when money becomes more of a focus in anything, but this has been far beyond my wildest dreams.

However having learnt all this electrical stuff it means the realities of the mechinical side are a mystery to me.

So the given the requirements speed is almost a non-issue (the earth's angular speed being 7.29*10^-5 rad/s) it's all about having enough torque and stiffness to move a mass smoothly and accurately. In this regard I would think that using a high quality absolute encoder on the output axis and tuning a PID loop after using say a wormgear for the reduction would solve an arbitrary number of mechanical problems. 
Some example encoders: https://au.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Broadcom-Avago/AS38-H39E-B13S?qs=0ns%252b%2F2Cp7jFzuqjoJquqaQ%3D%3D

Or should I keep watching ebay and grab some high reduction second hand strainwave gearboxes when they're available?

Personally I would lean towards the encoder option, because realistically the output is the important part, and solving a mechnical problem with an electronic control loop would probably be easier for me than designing a better mechanical system.
Hopefully a sufficiently tuned PID loop would overcome some of the mechanical failings in that part of the design.

Long post ahead. Here's some background:

I'm a 24-year-old man, graduated in May 2019 with my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. Spent a few months in a PhD program at my alma mater, found it wasn't for me so I went into industry. This is where the fun begins.

Made the dumb mistake of biting at my first offer in December; very small company that makes electrical cables and assemblies. Place covered in red flags: management was openly sexist and a ""boy's club"", a 2960's ""we've always done things this way"" mentality for starters. Interviewed by then-retiring senior engineer who had been with the company for a few decades, another engineer we'll call ""Steve"" (my to-be boss, 23-year-old with a mechanical engineering technology degree), and a sleazy car salesman type we'll call ""Dave"" (in his 50s, not qualified to manage a company but pleased CEO enough to be let in).

They offer me a role for fair pay and benefits, I accept (unfortunately). Get into the role and start in early January. Hell begins.

See, Dave is a sweet guy if you're a man -- so thankfully, he liked me. He would bullshit about his horses and his lawnmower and his Mercedes, I'd smile and laugh, et cetera. He respected me for my background and I respected him for his kindness towards me.

Not the case with Steve. See, Steve was the only engineer at the company besides me and the now-retired engineer. He was now responsible for everything -- product design, quality control, manufacturing support, etc. He was a cool guy when I met him, liked Call of Duty and was part of a frat at his university which he missed (no surprise). He was also now my direct report.

Wasn't so cool when he started to realize how much I brought to the table. When we got audited for ISO9001, I offered to Dave to create standard work documents for all our processes and manufactured assemblies. In private, Steve said ""you haven't been here long enough to do something that complex. You still have a lot to learn"", etc. Keep in mind Steve had only been with the company for a year and my degree and experiences made me more technically qualified than him.

Dave loved the idea; in his words, a ""fool proof way"" for production to work. I agreed to make one to start. Half way through that document, Steve started to stack up other, less relevant work for me to work on -- like cleaning and sweeping the engineering area, or helping production make assemblies (which definitely wasn't my job, I wouldn't have spent 40k on schooling if I knew I'd be doing that!).

With crunch time, I managed to make the standard work documents and finish all my assigned tasks. Auditor liked them too (big surprise) for their controllability and accountability. Steve was stone-faced as we walked around the plant with the auditor and Dave.

That was in February. Since then, my tasks have only gotten more demeaning -- more assembly than ever (typically all week), he doesn't trust any drawing or customer quote I make despite those things being in my job description (and, therefore, has basically revoked that activity from me).

Since the virus hit the US, we haven't closed our doors as we're considered ""essential"" by our manager, Dave. I do some work from home, but only under strict supervision. At this point, the only thing I do is create datasheets for our products, all while Steve watches my screen AND webcam (so yes, he is currently being paid to watch my screen the entire day). He's cut my lunch break from 1 hour to 30 minutes, and tries to make it clear to our now other engineer that I'm not to be trusted with ""anything technical"". The other engineer has analyzed the situation and in a parking lot after work, has explained that Steve is a douche with a power complex and poor managerial skills (to which I agreed)

Another idea is that he's threatened by me in some way. Not only is Steve not very smart or capable, he's lazy. He spends most of his day in his office on his phone or playing games on his PC, and only works unless truly necessary. He might be worried that because I'm more technically versed than him, more motivated to go above and beyond, and older than him that I may take his job (which absolutely isn't my desire).

What does one do in this case? My work life is miserable. I haven't touched a drawing or technical document in weeks and has been demoted to assembler and datasheet writer. I'm trying to find a different job already, but with COVID-19 comes a huge hiring freeze. Hell, I took the day off because I don't feel well and he's holding me accountable ""still expecting work to be done"". Let me know what you guys think.

I saw at the store they sell swivel hooks which use a couple lag bolts to attach directly underneath a ceiling joist. I made my own for two reasons... 1) the ones at the store are almost $30. 2) I'm very handy and have lots of hardware laying around. My landlord is worried that when I hang the bag it will be too much for the garage joist to handle. She is also worried that the bag moving around will cause damage to the garage door or the garage door opener. The hanger I built is almost centered in the garage from front to back and is about 6 feet in from the side wall. It's not in the way at all for the garage door to fully open. Here's is how I built the hanger... I screwed (2) 2x4's together and have them spanning axrossed the top of two ceiling joists with a couple inches sticking out past the edge of the joist on each end. I secured the doubled 2x4s to the joists using 3"" wood screws down through the 2x4s and Into the top of the joists. Before I put the 2x4s together I notched a small rectangular shaped hole in the center of the bottom 2x4 and placed a 3"" mounting ring through the rectangular hole leaving the plate which the ring goes through (which is approx 3"" square with 4 holes for mounting using screws) on top of the bottom 2x4. Then I placed the top 2x4 over the lower 2x4 and plate and screwed them together. Then on the underside the ring sticks out approx 1"" and I attached chain rated for 200lbs doubled up using 2 caribeaners rated for 150lb each. The chain extends down approx 2 feet and has 2 carbinears attached at the bottom which then attach to the 4 chains coming from the punching bag which j have not actually hung yet. Also at the top caribeaners I attahcced another length of chain which extends to each of the two joists, go over the top of them comes down the other side and is attached to said joists with large screws. I did this in case in extremely rare chance that the mounting ring which is rated for a couple hundred lbs were to break.

I think I get the main idea but I'm getting stuck on some physical intuition details.

For a simple undamped mass on a spring example, I get the idea behind setting up Newton's 2nd law to give us m\*x''(t) = -k\*x(t) + u(t), where u(t) is the input and x is the position, and then rearranging, taking the Laplace transform, and rearranging again to get:

G(s) = x(s)/u(s) = 1/(m\*s\^2 + k)

and I understand the idea that this is the response of the system to an impulse, i.e., Dirac Delta (t), or just u(s) = 1. My trouble is when I try connecting it back to my physical intuition for the system. For ex, I know that if we drive the system at the resonant frequency, w = sqrt(k/m), then it should be unstable and diverge, and I see that that freq corresponds to the poles, s = +-j\*sqrt(k/m), in the s-plane.

Here are my main questions:

1. If we assume we just hit the system with the actual impulse, like a sharp quick hit, my intuition is that it should oscillate forever at the resonant frequency, the one above. But the transfer equation is telling me that x(s) = G(s)\*u(s) = G(s), which has components at all values of s. I know that to get the actual time domain representation we'd take the inverse Laplace transform of this, and I'm sure it would tell us that it's just cos(w\*t) or whatever, but what does it mean that it has amplitudes in the s-domain at other values of s? For ex, for s = -4 + 2\*j, G(s) != 0, so that means it has some component of exp(-4\*t)\*cos(2\*t), right? I assume the inverse LT cancels all these components out but I'm still confused about the physical meaning.  

2. Similarly, if we apply just a step function, u(t) = 1 for t&gt;=0 and u(t) = 0 otherwise, the LT of this is u(s) = 1/s, which has components for all s. So if we apply this to the same system, it seems like it should be ""hitting"" the values of the poles some amount, which makes me think the system would have to diverge, but intuitively that doesn't happen (just pushing a constant amount on a spring doesn't cause it to explode). Is it the same idea somehow, like the parts at the poles cancel out?  

3. If we have a spring system with a damping force b\*x'(t) now, that becomes b\*s in the denominator of the TF. As b increases from 0, the pole moves off the j\*w axis in the s-plane, so it'll be some value with negative sigma and pos/neg w. I see the math there I think, but intuitively it feels strange to me that if the pole were at, for ex, s = -2 + 3\*j, then \*that\* value of s would cause the damped system to diverge, but the same driving force but without the exponentially decreasing component, so just s = 3\*j, wouldn't...why is that?

Considering the density of water vs air, a tidal turbine in water of the same size as a wind turbine in air would have more power available for extraction, even factoring in faster wind speeds.

Take an onshore wind turbine of diameter 100m (area \~8000m\^2) working at 15m/s wind speed. For a tidal turbine in a typical tidal current of about 2.5m/s, it needs to be 50m in diameter (area \~2000m\^2) to have the same power available to it.

We know that tidal turbines are much smaller than this. 

So I'm wondering, how much does the variable nature of wind / the reliable nature of tidal energy mean even when a tidal turbine is made much smaller than 50m in diameter it is actually still competetive against such a large wind turbine? I'm finding typical tidal turbines to have higher capacities than typical wind turbines. Is this because the rating for a wind turbine has to be an average number, and the nature of wind is so intermittent that this number ends up below that of a tidal turbine we know to be much smaller than the above? Or are the capacities given for wind turbines assuming optimum performance, and the reality is even worse?!

I know that Analog Designers (what I aspire to call myself someday) must be creative and be able to think outside the box. But here's the problem:

I often feel like an idiot discovering common knowledge. I am in the top 10% of my specialization and I definitely do not feel like I am there. How am I supposed to know when to efficiently use a capacitor/inductor if in these God forsaken 4 years of EE no one has ever told us how to design a schematic. We only solved problems like robots.

Sure, I think I am able to learn how to use those (I know as a matter of fact how to use capacitors for filtering DC, filters and decoupling, or so I think I do), but I am ashamed of not already knowing this. Who's gonna hire me this way? Of course, I will try to read even more on Analog (planning on Razavi this summer). I acknowledge the fact that you are not supposed to be a walking textbook, but still... When I figure out that I am missing a ""common piece of knowledge"" that I was supposed to know it makes me feel really intimidated because of the thought of other potential ""pieces"" that I do not know about.

The only thing I know is to identify transistor stages, current mirrors, a little bit of digital gates and how to choose dimensions for them, I'd say amplifiers but that's a stretch (I am familiar with A, B, AB classes), transistor behaviour, how to use laboratory instruments, a little about microcontrollers and that's pretty much it. I have had an internship in testing. I enjoyed working in the lab but my mentor did not like me. Whenever I asked him a question he looked weird at me like I was asking what colour a banana has. I think I did well there, but they did not offer me a job afterwards. When I find an op-amp in a circuit I rarely even know what its purpose is if it's not connected as one of the textbook examples (inverting/non-inverting, summing, log, integrating, etc). I have some software skills and by that I mean algorithms, mainly C, matlab and verilog. I think, I think I have a good understanding of the pn junctions and of the crossection of a mosfet. 

I do not know. I feel like me being in the 4th year of EE as a top of the class student is a big joke.

I usually answer a lot during classes and I do it well, but even though this, I feel like it is not enough. I am aware of the impostor syndrome. It feels s****y.

I only feel good about myself when I receive a good grade but that's only for a little while before realizing I actually know nothing about that field and only the basis.

Sure, I was a TA in analog integrated circuits. Don't ask me how. I felt, ugh, not deserving to be there and teaching those kids anything and I don't know if I did a good job. I was offered to be a TA in digital integrated circuits as well. Sounds good and promising. What am I even victimizing myself here about? Well the thing is: I bet that if I were to interview for an Analog or Digital job in the field I would mess up big time by not knowing how to answer or what to answer because of not having that knowledge or by not realizing how to do something easy on the spot and actually feeling stupid. I feel that my classmates that did not understand these classes as well as I did would perform better than me.

If only I had been given a chance at a job in this domain it would have meant the world to me. But I haven't been given it.

Teachers really like me and think highly of me, which usually puts even more pressure on my shoulders and I am ashamed to tell them that I feel the opposite.

Back again with another post asking for help.

I have an experiment we are running which involves catching a very heavy object moving very fast with industrial nets. 


This item weighs 90 pounds, and is moving at 340 ft/s. I initially had some issues with units which is why I deleted the old post and posted a new one. 

Here's my math:

I'm using the basic KE impact force equation. F*distance=.5*m*v^2. So F= all that divided by distance.

Here are my numbers:

F=(0.5)*(2.79 slugs)*(340^2)/3.28 ft.

I calculated the mass in English units to be in slugs (90/32.2). 
I used 3.28 feet as the distance to make it an even 1 meter for my SI calculation double check.

When considering all of this, I get:

F=49,165 lbf, 
where the units are slug*ft/s^2 (which I believe is lbf)

So I test this by doing the same in SI:
Weight=90 lb= 400.34 Newtons
Velocity= 340 ft/s= 103 m/s
Mass= 40.82 kg

So I do the same thing.... 
F=(.5)*(40.82)*(103^2)/1 

Where 1 is 1 meter.

F=216,529 Newtons. My units end up being kg*m/s^2.

So this translates to a force of 48,677 lbf. 

So these numbers are very close. However, a netting company estimated the impact force to be over 350,000 lbf. 

This seems extremely high. I want to make sure that my numbers are correct before presenting this to be the correct impact force. 

Can someone look over these numbers and tell me what they think?


370,000 lbf seems extremely high. Even for a 90 lb object moving over 200 mph.

Now I want to use a specific API which offers me the option to retrieve hourly W10m data of a typical meteorological year based on longitude and latitude, but I want to be able to move that around (relating to wind turbine hub heights). 

I can do that using a roughness length, this is quite trivial (just a mathematical expression, nothing to do there)

However, I would need a roughness length (z0), and I can find no databases on that. 

NASA kindly offers an API which gives daily averages of W10 and W50, so that could be useful. I could extract n values of W10 and W50, solve for z0 and take the mean of all z0's I find. Then I could move my hourly wind profile to the correct height.

An alternative could be to use the height adjusted wind speed database by NASA to obtain W\_hub and just calculate my Weibull parameters from that, then calculating my wind speed occurrences. (I would have to abandon my source of choice). However, this is historical data an not a TMY so I would either take several years an take the mean of that, which seems like a fair approximation. ^((I don't know exactly how a TMY is constructed, but I guess I would select months that have the smallest eviation from the mean of all of that month?))

Any help would be appreciated

Here's three questions that are quite easy to write down:

1)

Water flows through a horizontal duct of diameter 0.3m with a velocity of 0.5m/s. If the friction factor is 0.002 calculate the pressure difference between two points 13.3m apart. Assume the density of the water is 1000kg/m³. Answer is in Pascals.

2)

Gas is flowing through a pipe of diameter 0.04m at 7m/s. If you take the gas to have a density of 1.8kg/m³ and dynamic viscosity of 1.47 x 10^-5 Pa s, what would the Reynolds number of the flow be? Round to the nearest whole number

3)

A horizontal pipe has 3 smooth 90° bends before it exits into a reservoir. The velocity in the pipe is 2.0m/s. Given that the loss factor (K) for each bend is 0.21 and for the pipe exit 1.0. Calculate the total frictional head loss in the pipe due to these features.

I'm unsure if the links will work, so you can just take my word for it, but I'll try anyway.

According to THIS site.

The world used 26348 Mb/d of gasoline in 2014 (I'm ASSUMING that's Mega barrels/day or rather ""thousand"" barrels per day... according to the handy canadian conversion website for dealing with american units. https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/international/nacei/18057) Honestly, what in the actual hell is that unit? A capitol M in a unit NOT standing for ""million"" (and the AMERICAN MILLION at that, none of the ridiculous british million bullcrap from days gone by.) Stupid unit.

Regardless... 26348 THOUSAND barrels per day (and that's the OIL barrel definition of 42 US GALLONS... I'm assuming.... not the OTHER definition of barrel for virtually any other liquid of 31 US GALLONS (seriously, WTF IS UP WITH THESE UNITS.)

Now, if you take the website above, go into ""data options"" and select ""metric units"" instead of US units, you'll see 5475297 Mmt. (in 2014 for ""world"".)

That turns out to be 5475297 Mmt. I'm ASSUMING that stands for ""million metric tons."" Mainly because when you select ""metric units"" on the ""data options"" screen, it literally says ""metric tons."" 

Now, let's try to do the math between them... let's start with the metric unit because F*** US UNITS.

5475927 Mmt (x1000000) -&gt; 5475927000000 metric tons (x1000000)-&gt; 5.4753E16 GRAMS of gas(/0.7489 g/cm^3 (density of gas)) -&gt; 7.3111E18 mL of gas(/1000) -&gt; 7.3111E15 L of gas(/3.78541 L) -&gt; 1.9314E15 US gallons of ethanol (/42 (gallons in US oil barrel)) -&gt; 4.5986E13 US Oil Barrels of gas(/1000) -&gt; 435986E10 ""Mega Barrels"" of gas(Thousand barrels) (/365) -&gt; 125987880.9 Mb/d

As you can see, 125987880.9 =/= 26348

Ok so.... uhm... wtf? The really stupid thing is.... if you do the SAME conversion with fuel ethanol used, you see that the answer is ROUGHLY off by a factor of 1000, meaning that Mb/d means ""million barrels/day"" and not the commonly used (but stupid) definition of ""thousand barrels per day."" Ok so then we get the following.

125987.8809 =/= 26348

Still not even close. At least when you do it with ethanol you at LEAST get the same answer at this point.

If the motor stops spinning, either due to not power to the motor, or the shaft get caught we need the heater to turn off as it can quickly cause a fire.


We currently use a motor similar to this [one](https://www.grainger.com/product/DAYTON-1-70-HP-C-Frame-Motor-4M073), and only run it at max rpm.  However recently they have been failing, so now is a good time to improve the entire unit for the safety additions.

I have three thoughts on how to do this, and wanted input on peoples experiences with any of these directions.


* 1, I thought we could use a high/low current switch(s).  The current would be measured going through the motor.  If the current is too low, that means the motor isn't on, so shut off the heater.  If the current is too high, that means the motor is caught and isn't spinning, so shut off the heater.


* 2, put a gear on the shaft and use a proximity sensor (Unless there is a better thing) wired to a timer.  The timer would could down and if the proximity sensor hasn't sent any signal change then the shaft isn't spinning, so shut off the heater.


* 3, I know there are motors with encoders built into them, but I'm not sure how I would get the on/off signal from them.  I was thinking this may be the easiest, I just don't know how to read the encoder.


I don't need any speed control, or position, I purely care if the shaft is spinning or not.  But I understand that I will probably need to use an encoding method to know that.

I can calculate the wind load on 0,5m2 and use it to calculate the mast post deflection assuming a point load on a cantilever beam of length 11600mm. (For tubes diameter 80 wall 6mm, and diameter 101,3 wall 3,6). (Just to make things really simple).

I am currently looking for a very specific electronic actuator, for a DRS (Drag Reduction System).

For the ones not in the racecar loop: It´s essentially a system, that moves the upper plane of a rear wing to reduce drag on the straights. This is usually done with hydraulic actuators. For various reasons, i need to do it with a electronic actuator.

For the current Idea I am trying to realize, I do not only want to push down the plane, but also be able to raise it under breaking. This would require a linear actuator to be in an idle ""middle"" position and then be able extend and retract the rod to either raise or lower the flap. 

This would have to happen as fast as possible and the actuator would have to be able to resist quite a bit of force exerted on it by the air passing over it, without moving the position of the flap unintentionally. Nothing too crazy, though, maybe talking around 20N. I have found industrial actuators that would be fast enough, but all of them are way too big and exert unecesserily much force for my application.

For packaging reasons it would have to be quite compact as well.

I know I am sort of asking for the Jack of all Trades here, but maybe you guys can recommend me some parts or manufacturers that would have/manufacture what I am looking for.",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,159780.0,public,self,"Looking for a compact, very fast, electronic actuator for DRS system.",0.0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/f3jn2a/looking_for_a_compact_very_fast_electronic/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is to have very good accuracy and repeatability (on the order of a few tens of µrad or better). Output speed need be no more than about 0.5 rad/s peak. The whole actuation system should have a mass less than say 8 kg. It's got to resist various axial and lateral loads (say 500 and 200 N) and operate in ambient down to say -40°C / °F. The peak output torque I think is upto about 2 Nm. Power budget is limited at about 100 W peak or a few watts in normal operation.

My current thoughts are as follows:

- DC brushless motor and optical rotary encoder.
- Worm gear about 100:1 connected to a rotary stage resisting loads.
- Motor driver and slipring.
- Consult textbooks and websites for design rules and get suggestions from suppliers.

Specifically machine shops that provide specialized tooling that we've designed in house for use in our production processes. My company has been issuing competitive bidding per tool for years, but (unsurprisingly) the winning bidder often cannot provide the product(s) in spec, time or both. It's hit or miss with these companies. One part made by two different suppliers, for example, is very complex. The large well known fabrication company has sub 50% acceptance of delivered items but the mom and pop shop gives us 100% in spec parts on time they just can't handle the volume. 

I stated in a meeting that you either pay for quality now or 4x as much for it later. We are a defense contractor, but that doesn't mean our sourcing must match their procurement methods. Also, I asked why we don't invest in our suppliers. For example: Send our engineers to their site and basically tell them we're going to solely lean on you and in return we expect you to learn and to live the methods and processes we impart on you. Some may flat out shoot this down. That's fine. But one contract with us would 5x their annual revenue and make them capable of precision machining that few on Earth can do. This will lead to more specialized, highly profitable business. In short, we will make you rich but you must do as we say. Work your asses off and if you do that we will work with you, invest in you, and ensure your longevity because your survival directly affects our business. 

How do you handle this type of thing? Suppliers are critical.... I don't feel like it should be a lowest bidder one way relationship. We should cultivate in them what we need them to become. Right?

&gt; A licensed professional engineer (PE) evaluates, plans, designs, supervises, and/or consults on the construction or operation of: utilities, houses, office buildings, shopping centers, roads, bridges, etc., and machines and equipment as well as other projects and processes which require the application of engineering principles and data to safeguard people and property.

AFAIK it's just to have stamped drawings for public works projects, etc, which I would never need to do. I could probably get my PE now, I passed the FE exam in 2015. I've only worked under a PE for 6 months but I've never actually seen that requirement for NY.  [http://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/pels/pelic.htm](http://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/pels/pelic.htm)  

I also read that the PE or PC designation doesn't guard you any further against retaliation, only protects you from other engineers in your company. 

The quoted statement seems to have a catchall in the second half which somewhat concerns me.

&gt;and machines and equipment as well as other projects and processes which require the application of engineering principles and data to safeguard people and property.

So if there are any safety systems in place then it needs to have a PE stamp? It being?

I messaged through the office of the professions site asking basically the same question, but I'm expecting a rigid 'you must always register' answer, yet I've worked many places and no one has ever been a PE, sans the one place.

 a.  All  propulsive  energy  must  come  from  the  gravitational  potential  energy  of  the  mass  of  the  Vehicle. The entire Vehicle must start from an elevated, non-horizontal position on the team’s Ramp. A release  mechanism must be included as part of the ramp to hold the vehicle up in the ready-to-go config until it is triggered. 

b.  Conversion of the Vehicle’s gravitational potential energy is permissible, but any additional sources of kinetic energy must be in their lowest energy state in the ready-to-run configuration. Pre-loaded energy storage devices may be used to operate other Vehicle functions (e.g., braking system) as long as they do not provide kinetic energy to propel the Vehicle.

 c.  The Vehicle’s total mass must not exceed 2 kg.

 d.  Electronic components and electric devices are not permitted. 

e.  An approximately ¼” round wooden dowel must be attached to the front of the Vehicle. When the Vehicle is placed flat on the floor, the dowel must be approximately perpendicular to the floor, extend to within 1.0 cm of the floor, and extend at least 20.0 cm above the floor. The dowel must be easily accessible - no part of the Vehicle, except the wheels, may extend more than 0.5 cm beyond the front of the dowel. The dowel’s front bottom edge will be the Vehicle’s Measurement Point for distance measurements.

f.  The Vehicle and the Ramp, together, in the ready-to-run configuration, must fit within a rectangular box with a 50.0 cm x 50.0 cm base and a height of 100.0 cm.

g.  All parts of the Vehicle must move as a whole; no anchors, tethers, or other separate pieces are allowed.

h. The Vehicle must be able to stop as close as possible to a given measurement that is 9 to 12 meters away from the edge of the ramp. This must be done by changing the mass of the Vehicle. (The distance the Vehicle lands from the specified measurement is will be recorded and put into consideration when scoring).

**Scoring Example:** 

A team’s Vehicle stopped 28.6 cm from the Target Point. It made the run in 4.79 s

Vehicle Distance    28.6 cm x 2 pts./cm =   57.2 points

I recently got a Chinese 1325 CNC Router for wood and plastics, very similar to this machine: http://www.magiccnc.com/en/3amcmc/988.html

It looks like it has HIWIN 20 or HIWIN 25 linear glides. All linear rails and guides are centrally lubricated with two manual oil pumps. The machine came with full tanks, now we've used them nearly all. 

Thing is - the manufacturer never stated what Oils to use. I looked up the guides of the manufacturer of the linear rails (HIWIN), I found this:
https://www.hiwin.com/pdf/lubricating_instructions.pdf

My issue: I dont know what is important and the values seem so different. 

&gt; 7.3.1 Standard applications 
&gt; 
&gt; * Load ratio: max. 15 % of the dynamic basic load rating
&gt; * Temperature range: -10 °C … 80 °C
&gt; * Speed: &lt; 1 m/s
&gt; * Speed coefficient: &lt; 120,000
&gt; 
&gt; Recommended oils:
&gt; 
&gt; * Klüber Klüberoil GEM 1-150 N
&gt; * Mobil Mobilgear 630
&gt; * Fuchs Lubritech GEARMASTER CLP 320 
    
I am not even sure if we are using the ""7.3.1 Standard applications"" or the ""7.3.2 Heavy-duty applications""

What I found out is that the recommended oil have viscositys between 150 and 320 ISO VG. We are using the machine in a space, that can go up to -10°C in the coldest winter nights. So I guess a more liquid and less viscose oil is in order? So should I go for lower numbers or higher numbers?

What am I missing? What oil should I get? 

Thanks a lot in advance!

Eventually the younger techs close to my age in my unit would stop showing up to help me troubleshoot and they would steal my Polaris and take it to the other side of the plant. 

I was in my 6th month and somehow learning enough to get by, I took my ""first year test"" early and in front of everyone Randy bet me a steak lunch that I would fail. Why would you want to see a younger tech fail? Well, I made a 98. Boy was he pissed. You bet I looked him in the eye at lunch that next week, took a bite of my steak, and said ""Thanks buddy"". That was the best day on the job. I showed him up. But guess what. It got even worse. 

Going into my last month on the job, I almost killed myself trying to do my job. It was a Friday, so just Randy and I were there. He was at the DCS as usual and I had a steam valve to replace. I went to the control room, had the operators isolate the valve, and went to work. I noticed though something was off and radioed Randy to come take a look. No answer. I radioed several times and finally he said he was on his way. No one came. An hour went by and I finally walked to the DCS and told him in person ""Please, I need help."" He said he was busy and would be there soon. He never showed. I started breaking open the valve and flew back as a piece of the valve broke and went flying past some operators who saw the whole thing. Turns out this 700 PSI valve was not isolated properly, just as I had suspected, but Randy insisted that I fix it or there would be consequences. I quit shortly after. 

It's hard to explain but my mind was not in the right place working there with him, I couldn't think properly and was always under pressure. I think what happened was my supervisor talked me up after my interview and before I started Randy decided he didn't like me. He was also 4'11 and probably had ""Little Man Syndrome"" but I never once commented on his height or size. I went back to school, got my business degree, and am now a Business Consultant for start up a few hours away. 

Do scenarios like this happen often between techs? Was this a rare thing to have happened? I am moving back home soon for some family reasons and am considering going back to I&amp;E but haven't made the move yet b/c of what I went through mentioned above. I know I can do the work, I'm just worried about the whole social issue with older guys at the plant. I also heard it he might have been mad at how much money I was making as a new tech, plus nobody took me under their wing to help. That seemed to be a thing of survival there.

why is the velocity required for a rocket to exit earths gravity equal to 11.18km/s ?

I thought that the gravity of earth only pushes you down with an acceleration of 9.86m/s\^2 and that you would only need to overcome the weight of the rocket to have it escape earth?

So if a rocket weighed 1000kg for an example, it would only need to exert a thrust of 10000 Newtons to fly for as far as you want it(as long as it can overcome its weight due to gravity  and airdrag of course), but for some reason it is still said that you need to fly 11km/s to escape earths orbit.

Why?

I am a studying aerospace engineer at UW-Madison and this spring I will be studying abroad in Barcelona. I just purchased the [Osprey Farpoint 55L](https://www.osprey.com/us/en/product/farpoint-55-FARPNT55.html) (S/M) backpack and plan to use this as my only luggage. The dimensions of this bag are as follows. 60.1H x 33W x 30.5D (cm). There is a detachable daypack that measures are 42H x 27W x 22D (cm). The backpack has compression straps and can be squeezed into small spaces if not packed to maximum capacity.

Most of the airlines I would be flying around on with tight baggage size restrictions are [Ryan Air](https://www.ryanair.com/us/en/useful-info/help-centre/faq-overview/Baggage/Can-I-buy-Priority-Boarding), [Vueling](https://www.vueling.com/en/vueling-services/prepare-your-trip/luggage/hand-luggage), [Easy Jet](http://www.easyjet.com/en/help/baggage/cabin-bag-and-hold-luggage), [Tap Portugal](https://www.flytap.com/en-us/baggage/hand-baggage).

Here is what I found from each site for restrictions-

Ryan air:

Large carry-on: 55H x 40W x 20D (cm)

Small carry-on: 40H x 25W x 20D (cm)

Vueling:

Tap Portugal

Large carry-on:55H x 40W x 20D (cm)

Small carry-on: 40H x 30W x 15D (cm)

My hope is that I can take this luggage and split it into the day back and main backpack, one as a carry on item and the other as a personal item. Both are slightly larger than they should be, so I am wondering if I use two jumbo [Space Saver Bags](https://www.amazon.com/SpaceSaver-Premium-Reusable-Storage-Included/dp/B00X8KSKF6/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwa24v9Sr5gIVgsDACh0q3gAdEAAYASAAEgLqFvD_BwE&amp;hvadid=241929298736&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9018948&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=13741193049350697054&amp;hvtargid=aud-840076997981%3Akwd-92131540&amp;hydadcr=24665_10401006&amp;keywords=space+bags&amp;qid=1576000807&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFJVDNRUVpUNUxDUE4mZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAwMjUzMDIxWDVOWkY5SzlGU0VHJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA4NzYyMTQyQkIwQk9RQVVHTFRBJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) and literally put my luggage inside the space saver bags, I can stay under the airline's requirements. Worst case scenario I can rachet my bag down to make it fit, but the air-tight bag would protect my backpack more.

Am I crazy? Probably. But not as crazy as these upcharges to check a bag.

Do you all have any idea if this would work to compress the Osprey backpack down to within / close to any of those ranges?

I'm doing Engineering cause I like it and it's pretty close to physics, really did it cause I know there aren't jobs for any physics b.s. people if I decided against grad school. Going to industry after PhD.

Hi all,

I'm at a critical point in my undergraduate degree(s) where I need to decide which I need to put first. I'm firstly and have been a Mechanical Engineering student wanting to dual degree in Physics and eventually and up in Graduate school studying Nuclear Theory. That's where my passion lies, it's where I have the most enjoyment in problems and where I enjoy learning. I learn Nuclear Theory in my off time after teaching myself a majority of the math needed. 

A critical issue is that when scheduling my classes my physics classes push me back to nearly 6 years, 5 currently if scheduling worked in my favor. My Physics department will take some engineering classes in lieu of physics classes, such as intermediate mechanics with Engineering statics and dynamics etc. With that alternate scheduling I look at 5 years all in all total. But if I take those classes in lieu of the original physics class assigned , graduate schools would state that I would not have the requisite classes to be admitted.  

All in all this is where I have ended up but have realized after some searching that Nuclear Theory isn't really doing much hiring, even so not many positions are looking for physicists. So my question is, is it better to leave my physics passion to the side in order for a better career and go the path of a Mechanical Engineering P.h.D.? It seems like Engineering as a field won't be slowing down anytime soon, and I'm sure an Mechanical Engineering P.h.D. is more hireable than a Physics P.h.D.

Lastly, i enjoy reading white papers to get better technically, i enjoy working with guys who have been here for a while and learn from them. I worked with a local company on my masters thesis, presented my findings in front of their engineering board, our faculty, etc. and presented at an ASME conference in 2016.

The more videos of manufacturing techniques and 'how things are made' I watch, the more all of this blows my mind. There are several avenues of discussion I want to go with this.

One thing is about any general sort of mass production machine or automation process, for example, something as simple is mass producing [nuts and bolts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kxcw08p_oY).

Who are the people that design the machines which do all this automation work, for example the die machine which makes the hex bolt heads at around the 50s mark in the video. How were the operating parts of those machines designed and the velocities and displacements calculated so that process would work as fast as it can. Or how did people even work out that designing machines like that would be viable way to manufacture nuts and bolts?

I know that at a basic level, its all just gears, hydraulics, pneumatics, cams, electric motors and eccentric shafts etc, but its just the timing of all these movements and knowing that given process will give the needed output.

Or from the other side, when it comes to designing a product, how do people know that what they are making is feasible to produce?

For example, making something like a car rim or an intake manifold out of a piece of billet aluminum using a CNC machine, or an engine block/cylinder head using sand casting. For the engine block or head, with all the oil, coolant and intake and exhaust air passages needed, especially for something complex like a W16 or V12, is there any chance for someone to design a block or head in which it isn't possible to completely fill the required volume, or maybe the oil and coolant passages themselves aren't sufficient enough to facilitate fluid flow through the whole block/head?

And as for producing a part using CNC, again I'm assuming that the person who operates the machine, has to write some sort of code to tell the machine the co-ordinates of the cutting piece and the order in which to remove material and when to swap cutting piece sizes etc, so it is possible to design such a part in which it is far too complex for the CNC machine and the person writing the code to deal with?

Or even just simply designing a factory/production plant in general. How do you know how much floor space you need, what kind of automation machines you need, the layout of said machines, and the processes that need to take place at each stage and the state the part needs to be in order to move on the next manufacturing stage, how many parts can each machine work on or output at a time etc.

Like when you're designing a part, especially if its maybe for a specialized low-volume run of maybe 100 units or something as a supplier for a motorsport team for a season or for a high-end hypercar, how do you know the part you're designing can actually be manufactured at a feasible time frame and cost for that situation, like say the complex headlamp clusters you see on Audi, Mercedes and Porsche these days or you instead feel you've reached a point where you need to introduce a new manufacturing process or design a new tool, or material treatment such as having the material in powder form and sintered (like for silicon-carbide brake discs), or knowing that at this stage of the manufacturing process, quenching to this temperature and allowing to cool for x amount of time will produce this outcome which will be required for the next phase of the manufacturing process etc.

And I guess my final question is, how on earth have we been able to accurately design, manufacture and test parts like back in the '30s before CAD and access to all of this computer controlled automation? That really blows my mind. Like I assume now for casting engine blocks, people do CFD simulations to make sure the cast they've made will work, but obviously engineers in the 1930's never had that luxury.


I'm sorry for rambling in such a chaotic mess that I did, and probably didn't structure my curiosity well enough. It's just the more I think about this stuff the more overwhelmed I get about this subject and kind of take it for granted. Especially as I'm someone who at some point would love to have my own company/business of designing and manufacturing my own automotive parts for aftermarket or motorsport supplier applications. Whether it be brake calipers, rims, control arms, turbochargers/superchargers. So obviously I should make a conscious effort to learn a lot more about the design and manufacture process.

I've been struggling a lot lately about deciding between jobs. I am stifled by indecision.  I just graduated top of my class in mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech. I want to work with people and not necessarily be a super technical guy. I want to be the guy who understands the technical subject-matter and can be the liaison between the two teams or for the customer.  I am a very motivated and hard-working person. I'm 27 years old so I already feel a little behind for starting my career and I really want to make the best decision. 

Let's consider that the compensations are generally the same. 

**Job 1) Capital One Business Analyst**

This is a well-known program (Analyst Development Program) where you receive training for the two years you are in it and are an incremental part of the business. I would use tools like tableau, python, SQL, and ppt to analyze and present business decisions for a particular product or line of business based on data. It's like internal consulting. Job promotions are given every 1-2 years and its normal to become a director within 7-10 years. People regularly leave from Capital One to go to companies like Google, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, and Mckinsey. 

I would be in a cohort of almost 200 people

This seems like the most marketable choice

**Job 2) Crown Castle - Emerging Leaders Program**

A blurb about them from wiki:  *At Crown Castle, we work around the country to build and maintain the infrastructure behind the world’s most revolutionary technologies. Our portfolio of communications infrastructure (towers, small cells, fiber) connects cities and communities to essential data, technology, and wireless service—bringing information, ideas and innovations to the people and businesses that need them. As the nation’s largest provider of communications infrastructure and with more than 5,000 employees across the country, we’ve been building the connections that people depend on for 25 years. Crown Castle is an S&amp;P 500 company and one of the largest Real Estate Investment Trusts in the United States with an enterprise value of approximately $70 billion.* 

Basically, they lease property on their towers, fiber, and 5G infrastructure to the big telecom companies. This is the shared infrastructure model. 5G is expected to boom in the next 5 or 10 years and this company is situated to benefit greatly.

The role : 4 rotations in different cities over 2 years. The roles involve corporate finance, real estate management, radio frequency engineering, and assistant project management. This program was developed 3 years ago to groom people for leadership at Crown Castle. One thing they kept telling us is that 70% of leadership is up for retirement in the next 10 years and they want the people in this program to lead the company. Participants are given mentorship and brought into executive and leadership meetings to observe and give input.  So 70% of the time is spent on the actual role while 30% of the time is spent in development opportunities that a normal entry person or even someone there for 5 years would never get to see or be a part of. They only hire about 6 or 7 people each year for this.

After the 2 years, participants are put into the role of their choice, generally as a project manager. 

I see great long term potential with this company but I worry that if I don't like it that I won't be as marketable, since its not a big name and I don't know how marketable the skills are. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both companies have great work-life balance but Crown Castle is slightly better and even pays overtime. 

My gut tells me to go to Crown Castle, take the risk, but my head says take the guaranteed route, go to Capital One.

The homeowner hired a contractor to dig out the load bearing wall and brace it with the steel I beams. These beams tie to a smaller beam that is about 4 feet long inside the basement. My question is, is this done right? The same contractor also tried to secure one of the corner quoins with a steel cable. This cable goes from the front of the house all the way to the back corner. (The entire width) Is this a house to stay away from? More images in comments

For the past 6 years I dealt with water/water controls...but for the first time ever with little power background I get to deal with SEL relays!

I’m looking for guidance on:

* What training course(s) to take from SEL's University  [https://selinc.com/selu/course-calendar/?category=selu](https://selinc.com/selu/course-calendar/?category=selu) 
* Videos I could watch to give me some basic understanding of what these components do, and give me some basic theory BEFORE I take the SEL University courses.

Here is a list of components I will be interacting with in the future:

* SEL-3530 Programmable Automation Controller
* SEL-311L  Line Current Differential Protection and 
* SEL-2440  DPAC Discrete Programmable Automation Controller
* SEL-751  Feeder Protection Relay
* SEL-487B  Bus Differential and Breaker Failure Relay
* SEL-787  Transformer Protection Relay
* SEL-3622 Security Gateway
* SEL-3620 Ethernet Security Gateway

 In general, I’m looking for:

* Training with the RTAC and the Accelerator Software 
* Training on the Quickset software and “general” relays. 
* Info on GOOSE messaging, IEC 61850, SEL protocol. 
* I do not necessarily need to learn a ton about the theory.   
* I’m most interested in: 
   * How the components work, 
   * how I can make them talk, and 
   * how I am able to communicate with them.

Thoughts on this?

The hydraulic pump is 12 tons so we are considering a force of 12 tons acting on our supporting beam.

Important note: I have already been given feedback that I need more of the mini 2x4’s, because the part with the foam is the part that is supposed to be leaning on the doorway. (As opposed to the little plastic point that currently is leaning on it).

1.) I have 4 4in screws holding in the long 2x4 that acts as the trim that would be around a doorway. I originally wanted to use some 6in lag bolts, or 10in lag bolts to go all through the double joists. The reason I didn’t is because the length of my drill + the length of the drill bit + the length of the screws ended up being longer than the space in between the joists. 

2.) the short stacks of 3 2x4s that act as the vertical sides of the doorway, each are attached to the one on top of it with 4 4inch screws, as well as I put wood glue in between them.

Other notes:

Originally I wanted to put a 2x4 vertically on the back side of the joists. I didn’t do this because it made the space between the “front” and “back” too far away from each other. That’s hard to describe.. but since it’s made to be in a doorway, the width of the doorway is part of the design. 

I also got a suggestion to use a long 4x4 instead of 3 2x4s, but I couldn’t figure out how to attach that to the ceiling.

For urbanized areas, rivers tend to experience extreme but brief surges in volume &amp; flow in response to the increased run off that urbanized areas cause. As compared to water being absorbed by the ground and passing to the river over a much greater period of time. This typically is not good for the health of the stream. The flows can rip up the banks and scour the bottom of vegetation. They are more likely to create significant log jams, which in turn redirect the river and cause more scouring / erosion.

To some degree this is natural of course, but we're not dealing with natural conditions in urbanized areas.

I'm asking here for some help in dusting off some actual problem interpretation skills I hope I still have. Also input from persons whom certainly encounter these issues in their actual jobs.

My approach is first to understand the river's flow between two rainfall events. This will give me a total volume of water, and peak/trough flow rates that I want to find a way to smooth out over the time between events.

From there, I know what amount of water I'm dealing with and how long I have to disperse it in a better fashion.

Then comes the twin problems of moving and storing water. Looking at storing it first, I want to use large underground tanks - but that's getting ahead of myself for a moment, so just some imaginary tanks that I totally have a place to put.

Then comes pumping it, with piping considerations and power consumption considerations.

I'd want to take water from preferably the sewer system before it reaches the river, but also I could see using the river as part of the storage system by pumping downriver water into the storage system and releasing it up stream.

_____

As to where I'm getting ahead of myself on those tanks -I realize I'm probably looking at a huge area without making the depth of the tanks unreasonable. And it hit me, where do we have a lot of empty space? Sports fields. High schools, college, community, etc. All large open spaces presumably with minimal underground infrastructure &amp; no deep rooted plants. Just grass and bleachers.

If the total volume can be divided across several (several) sports fields with tanks of reasonable depth, perhaps the environmental program could be combined with everyone's favorite use of taxpayer money.... NEW SPORTS FACILITIES!!!!

_____

I'm looking at the Rouge River, MI, as my problem river. I looked at the last year and selected this period as a rainfall event to work this out on. A high of 1100 ft^(3)/s falling to a low of 40-50 ft^(3)/s until the next rainfall event.

I'm trying to best determine the volume over this period. Maybe the USGS site has a feature for this, but it's quite a clunky site for a noob to use. My current thoughts are to just approximate some curves that fit the flow rate, and integrate them to get my volume.

My project is centered around a specific dryer in our plant that takes forever to dry parts. Without getting too much into the full details of the project, i am introducing a blower into the dryer to recirculate the hot air and direct it at the parts we need to dry. 

Currently, there is no air flow around the parts (measured 0 m/s with a handheld air flow meter). When i put the air flow meter inside the current blowers exhaust port, it measured only 0.22 m/s. The additional blower i would be introducing to the dryer, is rated to deliver air out of the exhaust port at 13.5 m/s. 

From this equation i found on:  [https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/convective-heat-transfer-d\_430.html](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/convective-heat-transfer-d_430.html) 

for convective heat transfer: Q=Hc\*A\*dt  and Hc = 10.45-v+10v\^(1/2)

since currently the velocity v is 0 around the parts, i would be raising v to 13.5. 

From this equation, it looks like this would cut the dry times to close to a third of the current dry times. Am i right on all of my assumptions? Does it look like i might be missing something?

First off a little context. 
The giant robot in question is called Mazinger Z, considered to be fiction's first pilotable mecha, launching the super robot genre.
Now while it's a bit of an engineering joke how implausible giant robots are, the creator of this work, Go Nagai, wanted to have some realism in presenting how a giant mecha would work, from difficulty of operation, multiple upgrades, it's lumbering movements, ect... (see here for more: https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/lets-watch-all-ninety-two-episodes-of-mazinger-z.381572/) Even the power source was realitivly realistic when first introduced. It was simply what happens when a special element undergoes nuclear fission: a large amount of photons and it gives off no pollution(see here: https://mazinger.fandom.com/wiki/Photonic_Energy)

Why do I call this relativly realistic? Look at this concept: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_photonic_rocket The thing about photonic rockets is that they require a ridiculous amount of energy to convert mass into photons, something that isn't an issue for Mazinger apparently. 

Here is something a friend said when we were discussing this

&gt;in the first episode of the 70's anime Dr. Kabuto [the robot's creator] demonstrates the power of photons by firing some sort of electric bolt at a block of Japanium (the basis for photon power and Alloy-Z as well as its variants) This releases a huge mass of light, I'm assuming the supposed photons.

&gt;This light could be one of two things; one being a waste product like how the Cherenkov effect in nuclear reactors causes them to glow blue but doesn't aid in generating electricity. The other, less likely but still feasible, being that the photons released are harvested via the photovoltaic effect, meaning that Mazinger Z is technically solar powered in the same way that most nuclear reactors are technically steam generators.

&gt;The solar power solution definitely makes more sense, as it goes in line with the ""100% clean"" qualifier, but Dr. Kabuto would have had to invent technology far more advanced than our own in order to make solar cells than are that efficient. I don't think we even have solar cells today that work this well, and old man Kabuto is working with 70's technology.

This gave me more to think about...researching I came across Photon-intermediate direct energy conversion:
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon-intermediate_direct_energy_conversion

It sounds very similiar to what my friend described...it is also interesting because as some research on the subject has stated: https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:22058014
&gt;In addition to electric power, photolysis makes other product forms possible. These products include useful feedstock or combustion chemicals, such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and excited molecular and atomic states, used for laser amplifiers or oscillators.

This is really interesting as this reminds me of some of Mazinger's weapons, making me think that the robot is a walking weaponized reactor :)

I am currently in my second year of bioengineering major and I like it thus far. However I do not know if it will translate. I want to invent medical devices and apps for improved medical care and medical assistance. 
Originally, I was planning to be premed but am debating on that due to work life balance, years of schooling, and work experience but that’s another topic.
I have recently gotten really into the world of tech and read books about artificial intelligence and app development over the summer and really think I would like to work in app development. In my first year at college I took coding classes for the first time (public school system isn’t the best in my area) in c++ and matlab and arduino. I really liked coding and easily got As in both classes, to be fair they were beginner courses but covered things like if, for, while loops file inputs/outputs.
While reading up online alot of people say getting a bioengineering degree isn’t the best choice as it is too broad etc. 
I am really having trouble with choosing a major as I am so unsure about what the future will hold. I don’t have any mentors, and my family doesn’t care. If I try to confide in them, especially my parents they just throw their own experiences in my face and leave me feeling more hopeless and sad then before. 
I also am going to a slightly below average state school because I did not apply to any out of state as I did not have anyone to advise me and did not know better. (My senior year was my high school “counselor” ‘s last). I feel like I missed out on the opportunity to apply to better schools and kind of want to try to transfer to a better school.

I have just enough knowledge of auto engineering to know that I don't begin to know what I'm talking about. But I am curious about something:

Would it be technically feasible to design a completely self contained air bag system that a custom car enthusiast could add to their hotrod/Kustom Kar etc? By which I mean, the owner can give a supplier the type of chassis, total weight and distance from steering wheel to chest and get a package that only needs to be hooked up to the chassis electrical system. That means that the only place for an accelerometer would be inside the housing of the airbag.

I know that proper deployment of an airbag requires activating within a extremely narrow time window. A few milliseconds too soon and it won't provide full cushioning, too late and it could end up shoving the driver backwards, greatly increasing the risk of whiplash. But if you know the mass of the car and the driver to wheel spacing can you get close enough to improve the odds of survival? For the vast majority of hot rods you can ignore the actions of crumple zones since they don't have any.

I'm a long-time enthusiast, may join the dark side of engineering some day, but for now, I'm a prior aircraft mechanic and current career pilot. I have a question that's been bugging me for a bit. It has to do with the ""Jesus-Nut"" on aircraft. 

&amp;#x200B;

 (For those who don't know, it's quite common to use a single, very large, nut to torque large propellers or rotor-heads on. It's colloquially called a ""Jesus nut"" in this application because it's such a critical point of failure that if it falls off, you're going to meet Jesus). Simple concept. I'm just geeking out on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

 In a C-130 airplane I used to work on, the propeller is centered on the shaft via a rear split-cone (sitting on a flange machined on the shaft) and a front split-cone, with some drive splines in the middle. A big 'Jesus-nut' squishes the whole thing together with somewhere around 2,000 ft/lbs of final torque. My understanding is that this doesn't cause any bearing preload, so it's just stretching the prop shaft. The propeller itself goes through positive and negative torque situations in flight. After personally removing the prop, you can see that there is ZERO fretting of either front or rear drive cone, leading me to believe that at least a portion of the torque load is taken up by friction between the drive-cones and the shaft.

&amp;#x200B;

The S-61 helicopter I now fly has about the same method of attachment (the whole rotor head sits on some drive splines between an integrated cone on bottom and split-cone on top) 'Jesus nut' is applied and torqued...by hand...until it stops. Yes. 0-torque. My understanding is that the head in this situation is also NOT pre-loading any bearings.

&amp;#x200B;

 My question is this: Why would one scenario require a torqued Jesus-nut while the other scenario doesn't?

The idea is that since air bubbles rise in water, the tilt of the corrugated shaped material would force the bubbles to rise along the profile of the material and would move in an s pattern until finally reaching the surface of the water. The corrugated material would have to have a smaller span from the bottom and a larger span at the top so the bubbles travel upwards and outwards. To prevent the air bubbles from blowing out the sides a flange would have to be made to steer the path of the air to go up along the runs and not out the sides and up. 

The theory is that the air rises and displaces space between the corrugated shaped form and water that creates a wave pattern as the water fills in and pushes out.

I am a first year ME student and just got my first project assigned. I am looking for some ideas/suggestions on how to make a mechanism described below. 

The goal is to design a mechanism that can move upwards through a transparent tube, constructed from laser-cut sheet material and standard connecting means. The mechanism should be hand operated via tension cables.
 
The conditions the mechanism has to meet:
 
Firstly, the goal is that the operation is done via pull cables from below. The person must stand behind the tube. The mechanism must move forwards and upwards while you can only exert a downward and backward force on it. You have to push by pulling! - For clarification: the goal is that the climber system climbs independently through the pipe. You cannot attach anything to the other side of the tube that the climber pulls up because the tube can be meters long and the end cannot be reached. The goal is that the designed mechanism has to move away from the person pulling on the cables.
 
Secondly, the challenge is to achieve this without wheels. Nothing may roll into the tube. The climber must do something that looks like walking, sliding, stepping, clamping, and / or scrambling. In any case, it may not roll or drive.
 
Thirdly, you should indicate in advance at what angle your climber can still climb the tube, so what performance your climber is capable of. You can vary that angle from very small to the ultimate challenge of an angle of 90◦ where the climber climbs vertically upwards with only downward pulling forces on the cable (s).

I am looking for similar systems in real life so I can see how such systems work. Pretty much any idea/suggestion is welcome. I already have something in mind but think it can be done much simpler.

Any advice would be appreciated.

We're building a playground in our backyard. We have 2 platforms with a 15 beam that runs between them. The beam is made up of 3, 2"" x 10"" boards that have been laminated (using screws, no glue) to make a 6"" x 10"" beam. From this, we'll be hanging 3-4 swings from it. Eventually, we might turn this mean into a ""walkway/catwalk"" to get from one platform to the other.

One of our platforms is 5' x 5'. The 4 corners are made with 4""x4"" posts, and the platform is framed out with 2"" x 6""s with 2"" x""6"" joists, which we then attached decking to. This platform is 5' up. The beam is 8' up. To support this beam, we have a 4"" x 6"" beam that's been notched into the 4""x4 posts. This beam has been notched to fit the 6"" x 10"" beam in it -- and there are also a couple other supports beside the beam.

The best way I can describe the sensation is a mix between the sensation of standing close to an idling diesel truck and sitting on top of a running washing machine. It's not as extreme as either, but distinct enough to rouse me from sleep, sometimes for two or three hours a night. I'm quite sleep deprived. 

During this same period of time my condo has been renovating the garage 12 stories down, using MASSIVE fans to clear the garage of dust. I'm 90% sure that the vibrations I'm feeling are the fans turning up to a higher strength during certain times. Its absolutely maddening, and will last for at least several more months (at least). It's bad enough my partner and I have talked about moving. We'd like to find a different solution.

**What I've Tried:** Sleeping through it doesn't work, it's too disruptive. So last night I bought a four-pack of anti-vibration pads\*, placed one under each of my bed's wooden feet, and hoped for the best. No luck. The vibration was as strong as ever. I had hoped the pads would dampen the vibrations reaching my mattress. 

\*Link to Pads: [https://www.amazon.com/DiversiTech-MP2-V-Anti-Vibration-Pack/dp/B01KAFG8EG/ref=sr\_1\_2?keywords=diversitech+mp2e&amp;qid=1567270159&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2](https://www.amazon.com/DiversiTech-MP2-V-Anti-Vibration-Pack/dp/B01KAFG8EG/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=diversitech+mp2e&amp;qid=1567270159&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2)

**Proposed Solution:** In another thread on Reddit I read a proposal by someone who understood audio engineering that speaker spikes could theoretically be used to decrease the vibrations reaching the mattress. The basic principle, so far as I understand it, is to decrease to a near infinitesimal amount the surface area of the bed foot that makes contact with the floor (or whatever is directly coupled to it). The surface area would be so tiny and the pressure at that point so high, that vibrations would have a difficult time passing from the floor into the bed frame. 

**Will it Work?** Does this sound like a plausible solution that an every-day Joe with minimal tools could implement? If I purchase or buy the spikes, what characteristics should they have? If it works, how significant of a mitigation will it likely produce? Does anyone know a successful example of this solution applied to a bed? 

I don't know what frequencies are making it through to my bed. My understanding is that the speaker-spikes solution only works for low-frequency vibrations? If there is a way to accurately test via iPhone the frequency of the vibration, please post that suggestion. I'll get the necessary app and post the results here.

I was looking forward to traveling the world and experiencing danger while serving my country but unfortunately near the end of my training I was medically disqualified from being a pilot (and most likely the AF as well). Now I'm looking at civilian ME jobs all over the country and I'm in a good spot to be hired making a decent chunk of change.

This is where the problem arises though... I still want to travel, to experience thrills, and to have adventures and I don't know if I'm ready to settle down for an office life. My family says that I can travel on my days off (ie. Volunteering overseas or just vacationing in exotic places with the money I make) but I'm assuming for me that'll be at most 2-3 weeks per year and I'm not sure that'll be enough. I'm sorry if this sounds like a first world problem but I'm not really sure what to do with my life now, any advice is greatly appreciated guys/girls thanks!",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,135760.0,public,self,Early Career/Life Decisions Help,0.0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/cti0ct/early_careerlife_decisions_help/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,1566485800.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No, not the  childish giggly stuff about relieving stress with vibes.   Rather, those  who stated that the engineering community does not accept this process.    Which portion of the engineering community is a worthy question.    Those in manufacturing use the VSR Process on a production basis.     Here is but one of hundreds of examples :

Shear  frame being stress relieved at Adira, a Portuguese company that has  been VSR Processing their frames for 20 years +.  Adira reports no  variations outside tolerances (which are quite respectable, several  1/100's of a mm, full length), if stress relieved in this manner, saving  both time, energy (compared to the natural gas consumption of PWHT)  while improving quality.   Equipment produces superimposed plots of the  structure's resonance pattern, which undergoes a change during SR, but  then stabilizes, indicating dimensional stability.   Cycle time of less  than two hours, including setup.    Photo of VSR setup can be seen at top of [www.advancedvsr.com](https://www.advancedvsr.com)

A photo gallery on this site shows a few dozen other examples, including the 177 ton, 5.5 story tall, storm-surge gates for the City of New Orleans.   Most structures are smaller and lighter, ranging from 0.5 to \~ 60 tons.

Another  issue in the original post :  It was stated that the applicability of  the VSR Process is highly alloy dependent.   This is NOT the case, but  rather, workpiece configuration (you need to resonate the workpiece with  sufficient force), and material condition (heavily cold-worked or  hardened materials resist the effects of vibration).   Agreed, such  material conditions might well accompany certain alloys, but the alloy  mix or chemistry is not the limiting factor.     Since the process works  by causing plastic flow (a universal requirement of any form of stress  relief) / dislocation migration on the granular level, when such  migration / plastic flow is difficult, due to material condition, so  indeed is ability to apply VSR.

As-welded,  cast, or hot-rolled, or nominally cold-rolled,  regardless of alloy, as  long as healthy resonating is achieved, it will work, and at times is  either more effective or more practical than thermal treatment.

Certain  alloys are also placed at risk of loss of required properties if  thermally processed, such as austentic stainless steels (Sigma phase  problem), low-carbon / high strength steels (hydrogen-embrittlement), or  welded titanium alloys (reduced fatigue life), if thermally processed.    For these, a properly performed and documented VSR Treatment is a  better alternative.   Bimetallic structures also, such as hydroturbine  discharge rings, some of which are 10 -15 m dia.

See [https://www.advancedvsr.com/risks](https://www.advancedvsr.com/risks)

But  agreed, there needs to be more research in this field.   One of the  challenges is that a good model of how dimensional stability in complex  structure (such as the shear frame sited) is achieved is not in-hand.  NDT, at least presently, cannot parse out whether such a  structure is stable or not.

Or, in other words, the VSR Process works very well, and repeatedly, in practice  . . . . . . but not in theory.

There is a several thousand workpiece / year raging river of anecdotes currently, building up for a few decades.

I'm eager to get started so not to prolong the gap on my resume since graduation but need some advice on what is best to pick for my future career aspirations - which is towards IChemE chartership at a large corporation in either chemicals/oil-gas or large engineering consulting or maybe even continuing in operations.

I haven't had much luck with grad ceng roles at large companies unfortunately and I don't really know what do with that. For example a few months in to my search after graduating I attended an interview for a small consultancy which tested me on degree level unit operations material that I couldn't answer as well as I hadn't refreshed myself on it and wasn't warned in advance, that terrified me pretty badly.

Anyway, I did manage to bag two offers finally, though they're more management and less engineering

Offer 1:

Company Size: Very Large Popular Multinational

Work: Graduate Shift Manager

Salary: Near 35k

Thoughts: The company is really great on paper, plus the benefits are incredible. The only concerns are reviews from previous employees of bad work-life balance (shift work, potentially 50 hours+ no OT) which doesn't phase me too much, but also of the high turn-over rate of the role I'm going in to - possibly because of termination due to the very metric driven systems they have in place? It would be a nightmare getting fired from my first (graduate) job so this scares me the most. I'm assuming since the work is mostly people management I won't really use my technical skills as much so I'm not sure how I could break back in to engineering/consulting after some time in this role. Progression within the company supposedly amazing if you stick it out.

Offer 2:

Company Size: Mid-Large National (Not very known)

Salary: Near 25k

Work: Graduate Operations Management

Thoughts: The role sounds very similar but it's more focused on project work on a site which I guess is more relevant? There's not much else to say except this is for 2 years, the work life balance will probably be better as it's a 9-5, far less responsibility in management, there aren't many poor reviews. Progression opportunities within the company seem limited.

I'm eager to get started so not to prolong the gap on my resume since graduation but need some advice on what is best to pick for my future career aspirations - which is towards IChemE chartership at a large corporation in either chemicals/oil-gas or large engineering consulting or maybe even continuing in operations. 

I haven't had much luck with grad ceng roles at large companies unfortunately and I don't really know what do with that. For example a few months in to my search after graduating I attended an interview for a small consultancy which tested me on degree level unit operations material that I couldn't answer as well as I hadn't refreshed myself on it and wasn't warned in advance, that terrified me pretty badly.

Anyway, I did manage to bag two offers finally, though they're more management and less engineering

Offer 1:

Company Size: Very Large Popular Multinational

Work: Graduate Shift Manager 

Salary: Near 35k

Thoughts: The company is really great on paper, plus the benefits are incredible. The only concerns are reviews from previous employees of bad work-life balance (shift work, potentially 50 hours+ no OT) which doesn't phase me too much, but also of the high turn-over rate of the role I'm going in to - possibly because of termination due to the very metric driven systems they have in place? It would be a nightmare getting fired from my first (graduate) job so this scares me the most. I'm assuming since the work is mostly people management I won't really use my technical skills as much so I'm not sure how I could break back in to engineering/consulting after some time in this role. Progression within the company supposedly amazing if you stick it out.

Offer 2:

Company Size: Mid-Large National (Not very known)

Salary: Near 25k

Work: Graduate Operations Management

Thoughts: The role sounds very similar but it's more focused on project work on a site which I guess is more relevant? There's not much else to say except this is for 2 years, the work life balance will probably be better as it's a 9-5, far less responsibility in management, there aren't many poor reviews. Progression opportunities within the company seem limited.

Yes, I know, I know, this is like, the most cliche and answered ""Which field should I choose"" debate that's out there but I feel like all of those don't actually entail things that I am interested in and mostly leaves me just as clueless, and I would like some questions and an outsider's (namely, an engineer of each fields') opinion. I am in a vocational school in an engineering shop for the past three years, but for some reason I can't whittle it down to one. Basically, it boils down to the fact that I'd like to do one job without having to sacrificing the other. 

On one hand, I love physics and mechanics. Basically the physical and mechanical world is interesting to me. I also love machining and would want to get into machining as a hobby or maybe even if a job if Engineering doesn't work out for whatever reason.  I think the work done by mechanical engineers is so cool and interesting and I would love to get into it as a career. I enjoy being hands on. 

But on the other, I've been an electronics and computer main my whole life. I love how they work and doing them as a hobby. Typically in an engineering project you'd see me more interested in the wiring and hardware assembling side of the project. I'm not too super into programming to the point that I'd consider a CS or CE major, but I don't mind it. 

I'd want to go into the Aerospace industry. I've often heard the ""choose mechatronics"" idea before and I wouldn't want to go into it. I don't know, robots just aren't for me.

I am stunned and honestly have no idea how to proceed.

I have been working with this company for 8 years now, I recently transferred to a new department that I really like and honestly, I needed a new challenge.
My previous manager(s) all loved me, we had a very good relationship and they always trusted me. I am a hard worker and honestly an overall good engineer. I believe I am also very good with dealing with people (colleagues, customers, managers, etc...)

Some background on the new job... This is a new team, my manager is a nice guy, smart but he doesn't know the details of my new job. He told me to work with my colleague who is a senior engineer and learn from him. I was very excited since I really needed a mentor in this new area, but quickly things took the wrong turn. The senior colleague is absolutely clueless, he knows how to BS his way through things but he really has no clue about this domain (or any other domain really, he's just a poor engineer with 20 years of experience).
Since I really care about my work, I started reaching out to our colleagues overseas for advice and technical questions, but my manager has mentioned multiple times that I need to reach out to my mentor colleague first. I usually acknowledge his comment and move on, but I feel he is starting to realize I am avoiding this guy. My main problem is that everytime I talk to the mentor, he gives me really wrong advice and answers (like obviously wrong), and I have to go get the right answers and somehow explain to him and my manager why I ignored his advice. At some times, I feel like I just wanna walk straight to my manager and let it all out, I wanna tell him the guy is really clueless, and he is slowing me down. I have always been good at what I do, and I am afraid I won't be good here because of this situation.
I don't want him fired and I don't wanna hurt his career, but I want to explain to my boss that I am not OK with mediocre work. I wanna be the best version I can be of myself.

\[Company A\] gave me an offer about 2 weeks ago with only 3 days to answer, so I accepted it on fear of not responding in time (this was because \[Company B\]'s interview wasn't until next week. Just today, \[Company B\] extended their 'conditional offer' to me (the condition being that I need to undergo a security clearance first, and I would be good to start in September if all goes well.

So I have an offer I accepted with \[Company A\] but I want to work with \[Company B\] since their benefits, pay, and job role is a lot more appealing to me. But I do not want to sit around for 2 months with no work waiting for \[Company B\], with the addition of it not being a sure shot because \[Company B\] says the contract may change and they cannot GUARANTEE a position come September. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I am facing: \[Company B\] is going to start the clearance process for me in a few days, whereas \[Company A\] has not. I am afraid that while working at \[Company A\] that they will start the clearance process with me and see that \[Company B\] has already started the process. Is there anyway for me to work at \[Company A\] for the meanwhile \[Company B\] finishes the clearance process and extends an offer in September?

It just seemed like there had to be a better way to take the edge off the heat inside which is hitting well over 80*F.  This got me considering doing a recirculation system off of my well water that comes out of the ground well, faithfully at 36-37*F.  The concept is simple and nothing new.  Run a recirculation pump on a loop, through a radiator that would blow air through it, thus transferring heat to the cold water in the loop.  When the water hits a temp where it no longer is efficient to use in the loop it would be either dumped into another pressure tank, or back into the existing tank, whichever makes the most sense.  If in another tank, to keep temp differences separate, a one way valve would make sense, creating a separate closed system.  Obviously with this kind of temprature difference you are going to have condensation.  This actually works out in my case as I suspect I can use a catch pan below the radiator that would have PEX tubing out to either a drain, outside, or to a container to be later used for watering plants or disposal.  This would serve as a good dehumidifier, which I also need.

One of the major downsides here to water coming out of the ground so cold, is that you cannot efficiently use an on demand water heater.  I suspect that water being heated up in this loop system would greatly increase tank #2 (if feasible) to temps well above 50*F, making it possible and efficient to use in an on demand water heater, further saving energy.

The main issues I can see with this system would be:
How often the well water is cycled into the pressure tank(s). 
Finding a radiator material that is drinking water safe.
How much waste energy can be stored in X amount of 36-37*F water?

Any engineers care to lay down some math on this one, in regards to water temp/volumes and possibly energy efficiency?

I am trying to build a mid-drive by myself. I  have worked out some calculations and now have the amount of torque and  RPM I need. I need help choosing a proper motor for the build. I am not  sure about the calculations being right so please do points out  mistakes if any. The power restrictions for my area is 250W and my build  should stay within this limit.

I''m assuming the total weight of the bike including the rider, battery and motor to be 105kgs. My max speed will be 25kmh.

I calculated the Air Resistance using the formula:

    RA = rhoCDAV^2/2 where RA is the Air Resistance, rho is density of air and A is area under contact in m^2 and v is velocity in m/s 
    RA = 1.225*0.88*0.4*6.94*6.94/2 
    RA = 10.38N 

I calculated the Rolling Resistance using the formula:

    RR = GVW*Crr where RR is the Rolling Resistance, GVW is total weight of the bike and Crr is co-eff of rolling friction which is 0.004 for bicycle tire and asphalt roads 
    RR = 1030.05*0.004 
    RR = 4.12N 

I calculated the Grade Resistance using the formula:

    RG = GVW*sin theta where RG is the Grade Resistance, GVW is total weight of the bike and sin theta is 0.196 for a grade of 20% 
    RG = 1030.05*0.196 
    RA = 202.09N

Acceleration force required to achieve 25kmh in 5sec with the GVW of 105kg is **145.74N**

The total torque required including the grade resistance is **83.6Nm**

The torque required on flat roads is **37.15Nm**

The RPM required to achieve 25kmh after considering a fudge factor of 20% is **240**

Now since it is a mid-drive the motor must be small, high torque motors  are bigger. So the best solution is to use a high rpm motor and use gear  reduction to achieve the required torque levels.Am I correct? I need help on choosing the right motor and gear reduction. I'm planning to use a 36V 10A controller so the peak power can be 306W...

Here's the **situation of the stop automation control in our church organ**:

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T7z-MZUr1DkUuvdsoSxyKKX6rRJVQ9e\_/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T7z-MZUr1DkUuvdsoSxyKKX6rRJVQ9e_/view?usp=sharing)

* organ stops were originally controlled by pneumatic force
* late 90's an upgrade was done using DC servo motors, to which a metal disk was attached and to that a shaft that would push/pull the stop. Switch sensors at 0 degrees and 180 degrees and some electronics took care of positioning.
* currently, some of the motors are defunct, others have broken gears, still others provide too little force to move the stop

More details on the **requirements**:

* the linear action is 1 inch
* the speed should be fast, if not almost instantaneous (imagine the organ being played, pulling some stops and having to wait seconds for them to become active !)
* the force required for the heaviest stops would be around 200N (rough guess, I didn't measure it)
* special requirement: when *pushing* the stop, it should be pushed *completely*, preferably with some residual force to keep it in position. This is something that could be achieved by adding a spring between the actuator and the stop?
* retrofitting the electronics, using the current wiring (12VDC power lines + 1 control wire that has 0VDC/12VDC, depending on the required position)

I've been looking for linear actuators that fit these specs, but I'm not really convinced they'll provide a good solution, because the speed is generally low; the fastest that I could find, list a speed of 1""/s and that's definitely my limit!

When searching to buy online, Chinese manufacturers have models that *seem to suit* my requirements for around $30, while prices in US/EU start at $100 and up all you want (and I'll need at least 10 and up to 25 of those for the organ!). 

So here's where the more experienced readers can be of **help**:

1. are there other types of actuators that would do the trick? Is a linear actuator a good solution (and do I really have to give in on the speed requirement?). Or is the current servo/disk/shaft setup still the best option?
2. what mechanical component/construction could be used to connect the actuator to the stop, in order to have a ""permanent push force""? Is there some ready-made spring-containing component that can be used for this?

I know it’s possible to get a PEng and iron ring if you take equivalency courses and tests, just wondering about anyone else’s experiences with this?

I personally see myself going into academia/research after I finish my PhD (roughly 3 more years), but I know I would need a PEng to teach chemical engineering at a majority of universities (Canadian or outside). I wouldn’t hate going into industry (honestly I’ll go where the money goes) but I definitely know if I go that route I’ll have to work towards a PEng to compete with chemical engineers, even with a PhD. 

I’m not too frightened by the equivalency exams. I’ve always been decently math oriented, and have gotten nothing but As and A+s in graduate school. I’m also pretty sure if I take extra courses while doing my PhD, I won’t have to take the equivalency exam (for example if I take a fluid dynamics course I won’t have to write the fluid dynamics equivalency exam etc.), so I’m thinking about taking a few extra undergraduate courses in my PhD (even though I have already finished my PhD course requirements) to reduce the amount of equivalency exams I’ll inevitably have to take. 

TLDR; Anyone care to share their experience on the Canadian PEng process without a chemical engineering undergrad background? I know it’s possible, just a lot of work.

After going through them. I have come to a conclusion. And that is. It's a mixed bag. Can be beneficial and well, won't really matter.

I am currently doing petroleum engineering. And yes, I did look up API certs but it seems them for professionals i.e. graduates working in O&amp;G companies. Plus many certs related to O&amp;G seems to be given after employment. However. I do believe that the certs listed down below would still help me out etiher way in job/internship hunt.

The certs that I have been able to found out so far, would be awesome if you can also list them down, are as follows:

**CSWA** \- These solid works certs are so popular. Definitely gonna dig more into them.

**CSWP**

**CSWE**

**CSWP - S**

**CSWA - S**

**CATIA** \- Seems very pricey

**GD&amp;T** \- Is it only related to civil dudes?

**DFSS** \- Is this better than the belts?

**SAE** \- Any help to me?

**ASME** \- Is this better than OSHA?

**OSHA** \- Is this better than ASME? 

**LEED** \- Is it better than 6 sigmas and OSHA and ASME cert? or a bit different than them?

**LabVIEW** \- If good for me. When should I pursue this i.e. during undergraduate years or postgraduate?

**Pro/Engineer Wildfire -** Is this really needed for me?

**CDL -** (This one makes no sense but has such an important if one is doing petroleum engineering).

**ANSYS** \- How useful it is?

**6 SIGMA** \- White belt, Yellow belt, Green belt, Black belt. Which belt if the most useful?

**EXCEL** \- The advance one i.e. doing stress/strain calculations on it and etcetera. Making models

**MATLAB** 

**Programming Language** \- Any online reliable site that is recognized by the organizations. Any specific programming language preferred i.e. Python, R, etcetera

Now ofc, there are other certs like EIT, PE, and PF if I'm not wrong. But I'm not sure if they are worldwide, as I'm doing my undergraduate in Malaysia. 

I do know, many don't bother much, but I actually did some research regarding this matter on engineering students subreddit and certs were highly preferred there. So, now coming to the main point.

Case Western Reserve University
Pros: Small class size (even online), professors and administration have been extremely helpful and communicative (a professor has already consulted a department to waive a requirement for a dynamics class), wide breadth of courses (i.e. dynamics, vibrations, digital controls, signal processing, power system analysis), technically rigorous (the admissions advisers recommend 15 hours of work outside of class/course), professors work as full-time professors, 6-7K cheaper than 
JHU
Cons: not as well known in Maryland/Eastern seaboard, in Cleveland, completely online, not as highly ranked as JHU, Systems and Control Engineering is an unusual (though not bad?) degree program, no thesis course (though research doesn't seem to be out of the question), few courses available

JHU EP:
Pros: Prestigious title, well-known in Maryland and across the U.S., application-focused, wide selection of courses, course material is something in which I have lots of background (ECE-centric), labs available for use
Cons: courses don't seem very challenging (for the Analog Electronics Design course your big project is characterizing a diode?!?!), professors aren't PhD.s/work as adjunct, my command is saturated with people attending Hopkins for master's degrees, the administration hasn't been very communicative at all in the application process (I've had to call them more than they've called me).

I'm finishing BS in mechanical engineering, however specializing in thermal (might be different system in other countries). HVAC is something I fell in love with as soon as I started studying it. My first project was calculating heat load of friend's building and for my diploma I'm making quite sweet excel worksheet for determining effect of unheated apartment(s) on apartment building and adjacent apartments. 

I'm trying to learn and follow as many standards as possible. And here it gets kind of silly.

Recently I've been invited to work on a project. I did my calculations, followed needed standards to the point, but calculation was mainly done using ISO 12831. Exception were thermal bridges which I determined approximately based on other standard and ventilation based on common sense, while still following standard od course.

So after I handed in my calculations, I got feedback my numbers are 15% off - too low - comparing to that guy's calculations and experience. He's following way older standard which many people seems to use and it's most similar to fast calculation method ISO 12831 offers, which is from my experience (project and diploma) quite off - can be up to 30% it seems. 

So naturally I started doubting in my calculations, even if I checked several times for any error. Argument why it was wrong was that I took improper U-value for windows, even if I know which windows are installed, by logic that gas leaks out and you should calculate worst scenario, which is in my opinion bullshit. Other argument was that heat load through the floor isn't high enough because water might flow less than 1m below the house - more than 10°C below freezing point?

Only thing I could think of is improper determination of thermal bridges, but standard provides good enough approximations that should, as I believe, be freely used in calculations and not give wrong numbers, if any give too high heat load result. 

Ia there a possibility that my calculations are correct, but in practice old school people ""overdimension"" things in fear it might not work well enough? Because they are used to it?

It makes me kind of scared if I'll work on a project alone that I'd screw things up and people would say ""hey, I'm cold in my house!"".

One of the most aerodynamic cars on the road these days is the Tesla Model S, it has a drag of 6.2 Cd x Ft2 as designed in 2012

However more recent cars like the Mazda 3 (7.31 Cd x Ft2) are worse.

Though, even back in the early 2000's we had this technology, yet cars like the Holden Volt (6.7), the Nissan Leaf (7.8) are worse off.

These are just a couple of examples off Wikipedia, but I was curious as to why cars are still pretty inefficient in this realm, is it not possible to just ask a computer to solve for [x] and generate how the car will look?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a fairly recent graduate of Engineering, I got my first engineering job about a year ago, and while I was nervous at first, it;s kind of become a bit of a constant source of anxiety in my life. We mainly focus on heavy industry jobs, and I feel that despite my lack of experience a lot is expected of me because there's a shortage of engineers in our field. 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember being told in college that it would get easier after college, but I'm finding that the opposite is true, I focus a lot on the projects I'm given (so much so that I have a bit of a reputation in the office as being a slow worker), and even then I notice that no matter how much time I spend on something, I'm always worried that I fucked up somewhere without realizing and that eventually it's going to bite me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal? I've been trying lately to let things go, to get things ""good enough"" so that I can move on to something else, because there's always something else that needs to be sorted. But there's always this nagging feeling that I should spend more time  on things and I'm finding it hard to find a balance between quality work and fast work.

I’m a 30 year old, first time, student entering the engineering field. I am approaching the crossroads of which engineering discipline I must choose. I like aspects of Industrial, mechanical, and am on the fence about electrical or possibly software...

A little about me. I’ve transplanted myself from Canada to the US a few years ago (American wife says no to snow). I’m currently an electrician, unhappy with it, and decided to go to school to find a more rewarding career with a better life balance. I was always interested in engineering but missed the boat while living in Canada and settled in to a niche oilfield service position. Since moving to the US I joined the IBEW and have been doing that for a few years with little enjoyment. My wife said I was “too smart” to be coming home tired and beat up everyday and gave me the green light to do what’s best. Took the ACT, nailed it, got a full ride to a CC that directly transfers to a state school. I’m a few classes away from completing all the coursework I possibly can. It’s all been online so I can continue to work right up until I’m at the big school. Because of this schedule I haven’t taken any “real engineering” classes. Just all the maths, humanities, socials, etc. when I make the jump after this semester I’ll have to decide what to do as the bulk of my schedule will be made up of major specific courses. 

I’m in a position now where I don’t really have “time” to throw around and discover myself further. I have a passion for engineering, I just need to find my career within it and be the best I can be. I can only afford to be out of work for two years so switching majors mid way will be a very tough or even impossible venture. I guess these are the cons of starting so late. 

Back to the question at hand: which path? I like industrial because I am a true believer and have always considered optimization as the missing piece to many puzzles I’ve come across in various industries. I like mechanical because of its broad scope and more tangible results. Electrical is always pushed on me because of my background but every EE I’ve encountered does work that I myself don’t particularity care fore. I’m sure there are scopes of that path I would enjoy but haven’t come across any yet. The bridge between electrician and engineer really doesn’t help much anyway other than possible floor level communication with contractors. Software is the one on the back burner but I have always enjoyed technology (especially in my teens and early 20’s) and wouldn’t mind joining that ring. 

It’s tough, it’s stressful, it’s a big big decision for me and it’s approaching. I’ve talked to a few engineers I know, mostly electrical and one ME who has moved in to a VP role with a aerospace company. He said IE roles can typically be filled with ME’s but not the other way around. That’s about all the advice I’ve received within my small network.

It’s either something like this, or nothing.

The “Nothing” answer is acceptable, if this is indeed not safe.

“Swing” is in quotations because it’ll actually be a hammock chair swing. Meaning, 2 hammock chairs will be hanging from this, but there is not much actual swinging with a hammock chair. 

More like, gentle rocking.

However, when 2 (200 pound) people are both in hammock chairs, that’s 400 pounds pulling down on this.

And some people in my family don’t max out at 200 pounds if you know what’s I mean... (assume 500 pounds pulling down on this)

I was thinking 6x6 posts on each end.

A 6x6 (or maybe Sistered 2x6’s?) for the beam in the middle.

The beam would span 8 or 9 feet.

2 hammock chairs hanging from the beam.

Tell me how crazy I am (or a better solution would be great).

* Drivetrain: any hybrid design, like a Prius, Volt, i3, Pacifica Hybrid, etc. with any design or engine size
* Or the Toyota free-piston generator design - this skips the whole rotation step by putting magnets in/around the piston itself - you might even get away with using only 1.
* Fuel: you have to drive using standard gasoline, no propane or hydrogen. No plug-in batteries. 
* No cheating by using a lot of battery power for only the first 40 miles.
* Any amount of playing with clutches like Volt/Accord Hybrid is allowed.
* Other cheat systems are allowed (deployable aero wheels... fifth wheel... in-wheel hubs... whatever you can think of, really)

I was inspired by the Prius pulse-and-glide method to ask this. Some of the extra energy seems to come from disengaging the gasoline engine with a clutch for less resistance during coasting... Accord Hybrid seems to do something similar, alternating between gas+charging battery, &amp; coasting in EV mode on the highway - which as far as I believed, shouldn't have worked due to losses, but it does.

I am trying to design a system that could withhold a load of F = 290 kN (yeah that's a lot) and I was checking if it were possible to do so with an electromagnet (I'm not expecting it to work since the load is huge but my boss still want me to do the calculations).

Using the formula of the attractive force of a magnet : F = 1/2 . (B^2 S / mu0) with B being the intensity of the magnetic field, S the contact surface and mu0 the vacuum magnetic permeability (4.pi.10^-7 ) I find a magnetic intensity of B = 8.03 Tesla (the radius of the circle contact surface being 120 mm)

With this magnetic intensity, I'm looking into what kind of electromagnet I would need to generate such a field (geometry, number of turns of the coil, alimentatio etc). 

I found the following formula for the magnetic intensity : B = mu . (N . I) / L

With mu the permeability of the magnetic core material, N the number of turns, I the intensity of the electric current that goes in the coil and L the length of the coil. I assumed the length of the coil L was in fact the diameter d of the wire times the number of turns. Considering this, B doesn't depend on N nor L anymore (since both are proportionnal) but just d

That way, I need an intensity of i = d.B / mu to generate the magnetic field. Mu for a regular electrical steel is 5.0 . 10^-3 H/m, I picked a wire of 0.2 mm diameter (the tinier the less intensity I need) and I end up needing an intensity of i = 0.32 A

That's where I'm surprised. With such a strong load to withhold, meaning such a strong magnetic field to generate (8 Tesla is no joke I believe), I only need 0.32 A ?

That means that for the 2 minutes I want to withhold this load I just need a battery of 0.011 A.h capacity ?

Does anyone have a take on this ?

Thanks a lot :)

I am trying to measure the conductivity of a nanoparticle powder. Preliminary studies show that the conductivity is somewhere between of 1 - 1000 S/m. I want to measure the bulk conductivity of this powder with an error of +-0.5. I also to see how the conductivity changes under compression.  


My idea is to build a 4 point probe system. I plan to attach the probes to an aluminum powder press using solder. I have a bunch of things to figure out and will appreciate any help you can give.   


1. Do I even need to use the 4 probe technique here? Is 2-probe enough for this purpose?

4. Is solders (electrical lead free solder) to aluminum/copper's contact resistance too high for my measurement range?

Internal combustion engines have a efficiency of around 30%, the rest is lost in noise, friction, light, heat...

And electrical cars are very efficient but the batteries are a problem, Weight, Thermal control (battery packs have to be mantained in a temperature range to work correctly), rare earth metals and recycling issues, not to mention refueling a electric car takes an hour at the best case (a battery which isnt fully drained to 85-90%).

and then you have the hydrogen fuel cell cars which still have a liquid fuel but containing hydrogen is problematic, it makes some metals and plastics brittle and its VERY hard to contain as it permiates many materials, also hydrogen is only a storage medium, you have to produce it from either methane or hydrolisys of water so it takes more energy then it produces. 

So...

Why hasnt anyone made a combination of them all.

Fuel cells have been used commercially since the days of the days of the start of the space race in the 60´s. they were expensive and required precious metals like paladium and platinium for the electrodes, but improvement in fuel tech has allowed companies like honda to mass produce them. 

the question is, whats stopping us from  using a fuel cell that would combust gasoline or LPG ?

The most efficient gasoline engines used in normal cars today get around 50-55 MPG or around 4L/100KM and thats in stable highway speeds,  

but with a fuel cell, wouldnt you bump efficiency from 30% to mid high 80´s ?

you could use it for gasoline, LPG, ethanol and it would more then double the milage of any car. 

Would make electric cars much cheaper and easier since you dont have a large, expensive battery pack that needs thermal controls. 

Also if a normal gas tank today in a normal sedan gets you around 500 miles, it would easily get you past 1200 miles, and would allow you to refuel the car in the same 5 min it takes to gas up a normal internal combustion engine car...

I work at a company with 3 engineers in our business unit.

I have had ever changing priorities, usually driven by product failures in the field or from salesman wanting a tweak to an existing product to get a sale or a whole new product line. 

The product failures are frustrating because we have absolutely zero quality control. No first in first out, no quality department to check incoming sheet metal parts from our manufacturers to make sure they're to print. 50% of the failures are due to parts being out of spec. Another 40% is installation error. 10% is design error etc. Our customers are farmers in areas in the middle of nowhere. Therefore it's extremely difficult to get accurate information about issues in the field. This also applies to fixes that we make and ship since we usually get no feedback and my coworkers just jokingly say ""no news is good news"" and we move on.

Meanwhile, my boss is not good about putting her foot down with anyone regarding unreasonable requests or just with salesmen shouting about something that is really not as important as the other project usually the one they were shouting about the week before. She is always on the verge of a breakdown and I've seen her get teary eyed out of frustration... 

&amp;nbsp;

My main issue that has been that there is no structure to our priorities. I jump to a different project probably everyday and the old high priority is lost in the void. Because the next day brings a new hot issue. Add to that customer service asking me to look up information for them every 30 minutes. I find that I can't complete any project because it's ever changing, at my boss's request.

Every morning when I get to work and before I leave sometimes, I re-write my project list and re-order the priorities, and shove some of them at the bottom of list to the ""some-day"" pile.

&amp;nbsp;

**My question(s):**

Is this normal for engineering? Do you have suggestions about how to deal with this? My priorities changing is out of my hands and driven by my boss. I'm not one to blame others for issues I'm facing, but it seems like the management here is just awful. I'm actively looking for another job because I feel I've tried my hardest to deal with it.

Ubuntu Mate 16: Currently striping down the OS to the bare minimum I need. An alternative I've chosen over starting from scratch, (A server or mini.iso), then building up instead. Version 2 will be done using this method, but for the time being I need to learn more about the main components of Ubuntu, and the new kernel recently released in UM 19. I've been using my favorite command for cleaning; “sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove ProgramName*”. This method is fine on a small scale where I'm familiar with what I'm purging, but doesn't help me remove large packages and dormant software. Synaptic is also a good tool to use, but it's limitations are still my ignorance. A comprehensive guide on the steps to take to strip down a distribution to its “barebones” or my essentials would be greatly appreciated.

RetroPie V4.4: More testing is required before community support is necessary.

OpenELEC: Analyzing code and components to determine if integration, into an admittedly crowded system, is even necessary. (The thought or idea is that there would be a specially designed OS to handle the three general tasks of; Gaming, Audio/Video, &amp; Administration)


HARDWARE ISSUES

Power: Will consistently show lightning bolt symbol in top right-hand corner of the screen, indicating it doesn't have enough power and/or USBs are demanding more than the unit can constantly produce.

Boot: Looking for solution to avoid having to keep third party bootloader installed, (Berryboot), in-order to have an OS run from a USB.


GENERAL QUESTIONS

Is there an easy method for overriding or forcing components to update? Either one-by-one or in bulk. I realize that some aren't updated because there could be compatibility issues with the newest version of the software, but I'm not a typical user so problems caused will be documented and repaired. 

Is there a comprehensive guide to programming a Python project start to finish? Maybe a template? I can only conceptualize it to a certain point before it becomes redundant. In other words I need to know where to draw my lines.

For hosting a small website, (single domain), is there open-source python tools or examples to aid? Have no experience with website creation or hosting so would need to be a beginner's guide.

Grind it out where I am for a few more years, stash those big $$$'s away, and hope for an opening, or make a big move across the US now?

My airfoil´s chord line has 1 meter. I situated the airfoil in the middle of the rotating circle... I set the rotation of the rotating part -0,5 radians... time step is 0,005 and the number of timesteps is 200.. Simulation is fine just my values of CL and CD are crazy high, I dont know where I could make a mistake. Here is the picture of the lift curve generated by fluent in ""report definitions""..

I’m in my late 20’s, graduating in a year. I just received a job offer for an engineering position within my state govt, it’s been a long interview process consisting of multiple rounds. The final offer is contingent upon the results of a fingerprint based background check that references the FBI’s national database.

Unfortunately in my teens and early 20’s I made some poor choices that 100% are not a reflection of the person I am today, but on paper it looks bad. There is nothing violent, predatory or sexual, but there are 2 felony drug arrests, and a misdemeanor. They aren’t distribution charges, only possession, and I am NOT a convicted felon, those charges have been dismissed. I am however convicted of one misdemeanor. I am in the process of expunging my entire record.

But expungement isn’t a 100% guarantee that it’s been wiped from everything, and I’m not even sure it deletes it from the FBI database? I’m under the impression that this background check will show every arrest.

I did not lie on my application, I believe it asked have you been arrested or convicted of a crime in the past 5 years, I answered no, which is true. (It’s been 6 years since I’ve been in trouble)

Does anybody have experience with this? If so I would appreciate any tips or recommendations.

Each class was self-contained, the material from the current week built on what I learned last week, there was always a right answer + process to get there, and the teacher or TA knew both of them and were always willing to help. That's not to say I was a 4.0 student (my gpa was 3.3 at graduation), but I always felt ""in my depth"" and capable of broadly learning whatever material was thrown at me.

Imagine my surprise when actual engineering jobs are nothing at all like that. I had 3 summer internships and have been working full time for a year and change now. At all of them I've felt useless, either unable to apply the knowledge I already knew, drowning in the amount of knowledge I didn't know (while trying to learn it), and often unable to communicate effectively (both in not understanding when other patient engineers explain things to me, and not being able to appropriately articulate my thoughts when trying to explain my confusion to them). I know this isn't just ""imposter syndrome"" since I've seen other interns/other friends excel and surpass me at their jobs, even as many of them were far less successful in school.

In all my jobs, my favorite tasks have been what would rightly be called gruntwork, whether assembling or testing board enclosures. I really enjoyed the feeling of knowing exactly what I was supposed to be doing and how to do it. During my internships with larger companies, I remember envying non technical employees and IT and wishing I could just do what they do instead.

This has been especially bad at my first full time job, as the company is quite small, and prior to my hiring one engineer basically did all of the technical work. He's still a pretty young guy (late 30's at most) and yet knows so much and basically built the companies products from the ground up. Whenever I get assigned design projects it feels like he's basically doing it for me, as my initial designs (which often feel more like guessing than real design work) are so completely far off the mark.

Is this just how real engineering jobs are for the first five years? I really hope not because it makes me pretty miserable. Should I be looking into another industry? Go to grad school to put off the real world for a few years? Switch gears to software development and then get laid off in 10 years when there are way too many of them?

I will give you some background to my issue for the past three months I’ve been designing prototypes of a height adjustable shelf that with the press of a lever can be pushed up or down but I’m having issues with its design.

The things I’m having problems with are the designing of a structure which can keep the shelf specifically the frame attached to the wall.

Deciding what material it should be made of 

and the overall design I elaborate below 

I’m also having issues with the spring loaded bolt or latch that is installed in the frame I don’t know how I can make it so the bolt is pulled towards the wall into their sockets with the spring, nor do I know how I can make it so that when I pull one lever all the bolts are pulled out of their sockets so that the height can be adjusted 

As you can probably see in the diagrams of my link there are pulleys but I’m not sure if they will work or help I’d also like to know if it’s possible to have a roller blinds mechanism that can help bring it up or down 

Also in the link are pictures of different things including shelves, spring loaded bolts, the diagrams I drew and the humanscale float desk specifically the lever mechanism I’d like to copy and the desk without the top

By the way, the diagram numbers are 

1 is the frame the primary structure which is where the bolt passes through into the wall

2 is the plywood top where all the object will rest books trophy’s gaming consoles lamps etc 

3 is the lever that’s connected via string to the pulley 

4 is the string wire beads or whatnot that are used for the pulleys

5 are the pulleys that are attached via string wire or whatnot, to the spring bolt that when pulled pulls the bolt out of its wall screw shelf socket when released the bolt snaps back into place 

6 are the spring bolts that go through the bottom part of the frame they them go into wall’s socket and are one of the main components of the shelf

I'm in uncharted territory, and wanted to see if others had similar experience and/or advice to share.
I'm a manufacturing engineer, and have been in this role for about 9+ months. I love my job, its exciting, engaging, and I have a lot of freedom, responsibility, and a great team.

I also have a ""tech"" (he doesn't have a degree, but has worked at the plant for 7+ years) assigned to me. I'm not his manager, but he is effectively my employee as I give him tasks and projects. We have a good relationship, but as I get more involved in the process and have less time to spend with him as I manage projects, I'm noticing a trend.

For example, I will give him a task to knock out, say figure out what tool(s) the folks on the floor need. I give him some resources (list of tools that we usually hand out to our operators) and some suggestions where to start. 30 Minutes later he hits me up with a massive email with questions (I've made it clear he needs to be more concise with his communication, but it has not stuck). I google for a minute and answer most of the questions. I advise on what to do with the remaining. He hits me again with more questions. I google more. Rinse and repeat with other tasks and small projects.

It's getting to the point where I will spend a whole morning answering his questions or prodding him to get where he needs next.
I desperately need every minute of my day to get things done (coordinate with contractors, model workstations (high hit on time) and get quotes, order repair parts, etc) and it really kills me when I get derailed by something trivial.

I've made it clear to him that he's okay to make decisions without me, even if he makes a mistake its fine as long as he put some thought into it.

He has expressed that he want to learn CAD, but I fear that I don't have enough time to get him through the basics AND help him as he inevitably runs into issues with his modeling.

Basically my question is this; how do I get my tech, who has a long history of being an operator and being very explicitly told what to do all day long to grow into an independent thinker and problem solver?

Criticism welcome, I am fully open to the fact that the issue is me (not being clear with objectives, not spending enough time fostering critical skills).

I know this is extremely vague and more details would probably help but please bear with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I discussed this idea with one of my professors (let's call him Dr. LL). 

Dr. LL advised that I do two things:

1. ""Read as many research papers papers as you can""
2. ""Make a smaller scale version of the product, treat it as a school project ""

Dr. LL didn't necessarily say it was a bad idea but for whatever the reason I could tell he was not as enthused as I was; even though his thesis was on a related topic.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the issues I'm having:

1. If I start off small as, there's the issue of bringing other students onto the team. By doing this I'm essentially exposing my idea to individuals that may not in the end want to help or may end up *taking the idea for themselves* (this makes me very apprehensive and I'm not at all sure how I'd prevent this from happening).
2. If things get tough (which they will since we're just undergrad students), I'd imagine many ""dropping off"" to other things after a while (internships etc.) leaving me back at square one. I'd like to avoid a revolving door of people in and out to minimize premature exposure but that's a variable that can't really be controlled.
3. As students, none of us would really know whats going on so we'd be all just trying to figure it out which is great and all but I feel like time is important, the sooner it's complete better.

Given the above concerns, part of me feels that I should just go ahead and jump into it all by starting the company, hiring people that are paid/invested in actually seeing this through and who may have experience in the field(s) needed to get this thing off the ground. This means many other issues like gathering funding, sourcing and attracting talent, etc. All of this would need to be done following the completion of a small scale version anyway so it can't be avoided.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also thinking that this may just be too much for me to tackle and that I should just give up. After all not all ideas are attainable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone started their own company, maybe tried and failed? Are you currently working on your own idea/company?**Any thoughts or advice on this situation would be appreciated, even if it's ""negative"". Be harsh on me!**

I'm a 26-soon-to-be 27 year old non-traditional college student. I started school in the Fall of 2010 at a top-ranked engineering program (not that it matters much anymore). I started off school doing ok and managed to get ~3.3-3.4 GPA for about 3 semesters taking tough premed and engineering courses that were curved down. 

Unfortunately, my GPA tanked after a bunch of family and personal related events happened. My family tore itself apart, we couldn't afford school, and I failed to find effective ways of dealing with the stress or figure out what to do afterwards. I did so poorly for the next 2-3 semesters that I was suspended from school. I went back home, got depressed, gained weight, became homeless for about a year, and slowly had to fight my way back into University.

Things are somewhat better now. I have some work experience but it's not super-relevant to what I want to do. 

I would ideally like to: work in embedded systems engineering, or back-end development in software. I don't have target internships for jobs like those and I actually majored in Biomedical, while minoring in Electrical. But I've taken so many of the electrical courses now that I'm more than half done with the major as well. 

My grades are better, but still crappy. I've been back for about 4 semesters and still deal with depression. 

I've talked it over with an advisor and I can stay for an extra semester, take grad-level courses and then finish an M.Eng in a semester to graduate next spring at 28. 

Thus far, my mother's been very kind to me and agreed to pay a majority of the last four semesters. But I would have to take out loans for the remaining two.

Question: Should I just go for the M.Eng, finish that with a high GPA and then go to work? Or is it better to start working immediately? A friend in the software industry said I could start working immediately and just build experience. I hate having to do this to my mother who's been waiting to see me graduate for years now. And I hate the idea of having only 2 years left in my 20's to start working and live the life. On the other hand, if I stay I can network more, build experience, and start work on the right foot. 

If I start working and return for an M.Eng/MS later in my career, it would be more difficult for me to get into a reputable program bc of my shit past. 

I know school brand really doesn't matter much in the long-term; especially for SWE. And the best engineers may not even have degrees. But sadly for me this is one of the only strong points in my resume.

I'm trying to decide on which to take and would appreciate any advice, wisdom, or opinions. Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

**About me:** 

* Electrical Engineering student in Canada
* Two previous internships
* Career goal: Embedded Systems. Full system design (schematic/layout PCB design, firmware programming, and testing of the embedded system).
* Initial industry goal: Automation and Robotics, Current industry goal: Open to other options
* In a long-term relationship 

&amp;#x200B;

**Job #1** 

Job/Company Info:

1. Large company (1000+ employees)
2. Industry: Semiconductor
3. Location: 1.5hr commute from home (one-way)
4. Pay: $70,000
5. Duties: System-on-chip design (PCB design, Verilog, FPGA)

Pros:

* Closer to home and therefore gf, friends, and family
* Work is an extension to my previous internship as it offers different and new duties
* Better pay than Job #2
* Enjoyed my interview with the manager, seems to care about the well-being of his engineers and is a good communicator

Cons:

* Industry not as ""exciting and new"" compared to Job #2's industry
* 1.5hr commute one way during rush hour :(

&amp;#x200B;

**Job #2** 

Job/Company Info:

1. Small company (100+ employees), expecting to double in size next year
2. Industry: Warehouse automation, robotics
3. Location: Different province
4. Pay: $55,000
5. Duties: Electrical and software validation (C++, PCB design, Testing)

Pros:

* Relatively new: &lt; 5 years old\*\* (\*\*More opportunities to wear different hats, but job may not be stable because of company infancy)
* Exciting industry and work
* Flexible vacation dates (offer letter mentions flexible vacation policy, but no additional details)

Cons:

* Lower pay, won't be able to save as much
* Different province (slightly lower COL), therefore will require relocation\*\* (\*\*Could be a good thing since I'd like to move out and begin my adult journey)

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, both jobs are great and offers a path towards my career goal of becoming an embedded system expert. Seems to boil down to:  Stability and good pay vs Risk and Passion? Granted $55k is within the expected job market of a new EE grad in Canada, albeit in the lower end.

I have a 5000mAh lipo battery powering the raspberry pi, audio amplifier, and screen. The current when running off of a power cable is 2.2A, but that is also charging the battery at 1000mAh (or it's supposed to be, I think it's charging at a lower rate). When running off only the battery I get a voltage sag of .5A, and drop of .3A across a Schottky diode. I understand the drop across the diode, but should I be seeing that much of a sag at 2.2A (the battery is probably seeing less than that since it's not charging itself)?  [Here is a general idea of the charging circuit I am using](http://www.electrobob.com/5up-simple-5v-ups/), and the diodes are 1N5822's.

Is a .5v voltage sag off a 4.2v battery typical at these currents? Is there anything you would recommend to improve the performance? I haven't yet tested it with another battery, the battery I have is a fairly specific size, but I do have some spare 18650 batteries I could put in a test rig.

I hope this is the right subreddit for this question, and if it is not if someone could point me to a more relevant one it would be greatly appreciated. 

My situation is this:

I am an Instrument and Electrical Technician at a natural gas power plant. For one of our control systems the company needs to make some extensive logic changes due to incorrect design during an upgrade/conversion from Micronet to ABB S+. 

I am fairly adept and from working as the technical lead on the upgrade and working heavily with the startup field engineers I have learned how to do most of the programming. The management team has asked me to implement the logic changes that need to be made and I said I am more than willing to do so as I have in the past, but I would request that they send me an email or some other documented request on the changes they would like me to make as opposed to just a verbal communique. One of my managers is fine with that, however another is not as much. His belief is that his word is bond and it sets a dangerous precedent that other people will not do stuff unless it is in writing. I understand his side, however I feel that given the nature of changing logic and the possible consequences I am not being unreasonable. 

So am I being unreasonable or should I stand firm in wanting documented proof for liability/cya? Is this / is this not some industry standard? The one other controls engineer I have talked to have agreed with me, but I feel like he may be biased towards my POV.

&amp;#x200B;

I have conceived a radically different engine design from that of current 2 and 4 stroke internal combustion engines. I have secured prior art through a provisional patent for its development. I am in need of some engineering assistance to essentially put the numbers to the concept. The configurations and components are otherwise fully documented through technical pencil drawings which can be imaged and shared with anyone interested in providing (what should be) a relatively small but critical amount of engineering analysis for presentation to potential manufacturers.

&amp;#x200B;

Though ""Brand new"" in comparison to current 2 and 4 stroke I/C engines, the basic design is derived from that of the dual oscillating steam engine developed by John Ericsson in the mid 1800's. This engine powered the original ""Monitor"" warship in the American Civil War as well as the Stanley Steamer automobiles of the early 1900's. Two opposing power strokes per cycle per cylinder it has, and very simple it is. Adapting this engine to internal combustion power has taken more than a little thinking and sketching to achieve functionality while maintaining its essential efficiency and simplicity.

&amp;#x200B;

Look under the hood of any car! To the unfamiliar, it's an unfathomable mess of belts, hoses, wires, linkages, canisters, tubes and brackets. All is well designed and necessary for its performance, but mostly unneeded for the design I am proposing, which is a paradigm shift in vehicle propulsion. Ericsson's design translates well to internal combustion if a few problems are solved.

&amp;#x200B;

I am certain that this engine profile has been considered by others who were likely stymied by inherent challenges in heat dissipation, aspiration and cylinder lubrication this profile presents. My design thoroughly and simply solves these problems and makes the practical use of this engine type possible. Graphic descriptions and narratives of all systems have been created.

&amp;#x200B;

The resulting power plant is a screamer -- small, light, simple, powerful and efficient. The 3 cylinder version provides 6 power strokes per cycle and compares to a larger turbocharged V-8 using otherwise conventional aspiration and fuel. As power and efficiency go hand in hand, models can be designed to provide twice the power or twice the fuel economy as a 4 stroke engine of similar displacement at roughly 1/3 the weight and size.

&amp;#x200B;

The engine can be developed in 1 to 6 cylinder versions, with a range of piston diameters as appropriate for the type of fuel to be used. Diesel, gasoline, natural gas, or racing fuels can be accommodated. Applications for all types of land vehicles, aircraft,  watercraft and industrial uses have been explored and graphically developed. These also can be imaged and shared.

&amp;#x200B;

For any automotive engineer that may be able to work with me on establishing the feasibility of my concept/design, please reach out to me via PM. If this turns into something, we would certainly share in the rewards.

Many of the custom cables we manufactured in-house so our documentation methods were developed to fit our needs, usually consisting of CAD drawings (which take a long time to make) and spreadsheets.

Now we have a large system comprising a few dozen sub-systems (and sub-sub-systems) with well over 100 cables/wiring harnesses. Documenting this with our usual methods would be unwieldy and there is a push to outsource all custom manufacturing.

Unfortunately, we do not use formal PLM software and I don't believe we have the resources to integrate a full PLM system unless it is very flexible/scalable, easy to learn/use, and of course cheap.

* BOM(s) with suppliers and pricing for all components

* Manufacturing instructions for the custom cable manufacturer(s)

* Internal (entirely in a sub-system) vs External (interconnecting sub-systems) cables

I want to test a hypothesis...

cosmic inflation redshift destroys energy

cosmic inflation create new space

new space has vacuum energy

&amp;#x200B;

HYPOTHESIS 1: expansion red-shift of certain energies(eg photons) has space-energy conservation. space to energy / energy to space conversion is occurring, and if you factor in space as energy there is conservation.

&amp;#x200B;

I roughly calculated the energy the numbers and they fall within reasonable range, but I cant think of a way to test it except correlating expansion rate with radiation energy traversing various regions of spacetime,

&amp;#x200B;

So I while I'm working on that I moved on to hypothesis 2, which is much more of a long shot, because relative velocity redshift doesn't have lost energy, the energy is conserved as momentum. But I figure is one form of redshift involves space-energy conversion then perhaps so do the other types of redshift.

&amp;#x200B;

Hypothesis 2 : All red/blue shifting includes an energy to space conversion. While traveling at high speed if light is emitted forward it is blue shifted and converts some space into energy, emit light backwards and it creates space. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my plan is to arrange a time dilation test by accelerating a time counter. Sandwich it between 2 powerful LED arrays, one facing forward and one facing backwards. check if time dilation is affected when light is emitted forward and/or backwards.

I have a puzzle I've been trying to solve for awhile; **What kind of grease do airsoft manufacturer**'s  use in their guns. The manufacturer's (Generally East-Asia factories)  of these guns aren't really known for high QC, so the assumption is that  the grease is extremely cheap, low-quality stuff. The hobby community  always recommends to **remove and replace** the factory grease, but whenever I press them on it it turns out they **don't actually know what the grease is** or what's wrong with it.

So in the picture is a zinc-alloy gearbox out of an airsoft gun and there's, what looks like two kinds of grease:

\-One for a set of **sintered steel gears** with **nylon** bushings

\-One for a compression system with **Nylon** and **Buna-N parts**.

The grease is **very thick** and has a **metallic smell at room temperature**. When I heat it with a butane torch it **melts into a liquid**, but **doesn't burn** and doesn't bubble. There's also very little white smoke, although it starts to have a slight motor oil smell to it.

Is  there any other kind of tests I can do? I remember smelling a tube of  an anti-corrosive grease years ago that smelled similar, but I can't  remember what the name of it is.

Currently, I am a freshman in my second semester and I am on a Computer Engineering track. Since high school, I've been committed to going into engineering, but lately I've been questioning myself for a few reasons.

I've noticed that Software Engineering is really in demand and I heard it's quite common for computer engineers to end up working as software engineers. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, my main concern is employment in my late 30's and onwards. What I heard from family and a little bit of the internet, ageism is inevitable and it's common for older employees in the tech industry to get laid off? One of my friends dad, who works at Samsung, suggested that I shouldn't go into Software Engineering because there's ""nothing to do"", and all he does is maintain security and make sure there are no issues. Another one of my friends dad was a software engineer (who also worked at Samsung), and that friend told be that her dad is always studying and keeping up with new technology. That didn't seem to be a problem for me, but she also explained how her dad applied for another job at Google as a software engineer and the interviewers were able to tell that he tried to cram all the new information. Now I believe he works somewhere else as a data analysist or something similar at a different company. To me, I feel like at that age, to work in such a demanding environment is unhealthy, especially when you want some free time to spend with your family and yourself. 

I know software engineering isn't my only option, but does anyone else know what other fields of engineering is in demand? And are there any engineers who are worried about being laid off in the future?

So a little bit about me and my ""plans"":

During my first semester I was unsure about my major because I was worried about being employed in the future. So I considered going into the pre-med track because being a doctor could secure having a job in my late years as well. But I've noticed that going to med school and becoming a doctor just for the salary is not a good idea unless I truly love the process and result of becoming a doctor. I wasn't sure if I was willing to put in the time and effort for med school and residency. But let's say I get into med school and drop out halfway, I would have a hard time repaying the debt and it would be too much of a burden to my family because we don't have that kind of money. So clearly, I like to play it safe and I'm now more concerned about having a job and keeping financial stability in the future. I'm starting to realized that I tend to value mood and free time, rather than rich and luxury. I've considered law, business, etc., but my interests show that I am more likely to be fitted for engineering. If I am afraid of being laid off, I wondered, If I keep my skills sharp and gain years of experience, would getting a higher position like manager better secure my employment? I also heard that getting a higher position will demand more work, and that all ties down to my stamina and health by working long hours. Ideally, I want to have the right balance for work and free time while earning a steady income, but everyone's standard of balance can be different. I don't really know what kind of occupation in engineering offers that kind of benefit and I know I have to put in the work which I'm willing to do. I'm just not sure what I actually want to do because I never been exposed to the actual work I'd end up doing, so I don't know how I'm gonna plan my 40's and 50's. I also don't have a specific interest like automotive, but I do love the idea of improving upon all kinds of things, hence, engineering. I kind of think it's too early for an 18 year old to decide what he wants to do for the rest of his life haha. I know things can change along the way but I feel more comfortable and confident when I have a plan that I can stick with.

I understand some things I said could be biased, but I am open to all kinds of ideas and suggestions. Perhaps the people I talked to and the things on the internet weren't explaining what every engineer does on a daily basis. There's a lot that I don't know which is probably why I'm worried so much and that's really why I'm here haha, I'm hoping there are other people who can  help me out and share their beliefs and experiences.

I purchased a 12V 30 RPM gearmotor and (at the moment) I'm just trying to get it running using a switch and a battery. So, I also decided to buy some small A23 12 volt batteries to use alongside it. However, when I tested the motor today with the battery, it did not budge. The A23 batteries, as I discovered later, only outputted a current of &lt;200 mA. As far as I've been able to find, the gearmotor needs about 2 amps. So, how can I achieve this current without putting 10 A23 batteries in parallel?  

As a side note, I cannot have the battery(ies) be too heavy or big, as the chassis is not particularly large or strong, and I have no problems with going to home depot or something to buy a new battery.

I've done a lot of research on what Electrical Engineering entails, but I feel I still have very little knowledge about the field as a whole and some smaller details like the typical day-to-day setup. I don't really know anyone in person who works in the field so I figured I'd ask you guys here instead.

But first, a little background:

I'm 17 years old, female, and I live in the Philippines. I originally wanted to be a Robotics Engineer (I still do) but I didn't want to study RBE in undergrad 'cause I wanted to keep my options open. So I decided to study EE 'cause it had a lot of applications to robotics (robotics as in Boston Dynamics style, not industrial automation). At the same time, I found a lot of its sub-disciplines to be very interesting and exciting to make a career out of — stuff like control systems, signal processing, optics, electromagnetism, and RF just to name a few. I'd also like to work in the aerospace industry if the opportunity presents itself. For now though, I'd really just like to focus on pure Electrical Engineering.

So now, here are my questions:

* In what sub-field do you currently work in right now and can you give a brief description about what it focuses on and such?
* What is your title and what does the typical day look like for you?
* Which part about your job do you really like and enjoy? And which part do you dislike/like the least?
* What made you choose to go into EE? And into your chosen sub-field?
* Would you recommend your field to me in terms of demand, salary, travel incentives, variation of roles, and other opportunities?
* Do you have any specific and underrated college tips you'd like to give? Preferably about what I should do now to have more things to put on my resume later on.
* Outside the more STEM-y things, what do you think engineers, in general, should give more attention to to be more well-rounded?

Thank you for your time and for helping out a (really scared of what the future holds) engineer-in-the-making! Your help is very much appreciated. I wish you all the best in your careers and I hope you all continue solving problems for the world. You guys are awesome!

I am trying to elevate 200.000 m^(3) water per day from a dam, to a water treatment plant.

1. Plant is located at elevation of 260 meters from mean sea level.
2. Dams water surface elevated 100 meters from sea level.

What i am asked to calculate;

1. The energy required to elevate water from the reservoir to the treatment plant by ignoring the head loss due to friction and minor losses.
2. Make a research to select an appropriate pump(s)

What should be my approach?

I have determined the volume flow rate; Q = 125/54 m^(3)/s . And according to the volume flow rate equation;

Q = A v , I assumed to have 1 m/s of average velocity, and in that case i have determined required diameter of pipeline.

Then i assumed the atmoshperic pressures are the same at 100m and 260m.

&amp;#x200B;

According to my assumption; I used General Energy Equation;

I ignored pressures, water velocity at dam ( since it must be almost 0), I ignored hR and hL in the system since the question told me to. I only used hA in my equation. And i ended up with this;

&amp;#x200B;

100 + hA = 260 + v^(2)/2g === hA = 160.050 m

And later, i used Power delivered by the pump equation;   


PA= hA.y.Q

Where;  


* hA = Energy added to system
* y = Spesific weight of the fluid
* Q = Volume flow rate.

And i ended up with PA= 3634.5 kW which i called as energy required to elevate water.

&amp;#x200B;

I have considered the fact that one pipeline and one single pump will not be efficent. So what i am thinking is (if my calculations till now are correct) i will rewrite the equations, according to suitable pumps' volume flow rate (Q). And i will obtain multiple pipelines, i will sum them to obtain the total energy required.

&amp;#x200B;

My question; Is my procedure correct? If it is not, what should i be doing?

My tower has 450 TR and 300 m3/h. Which I presume is quite close to his scenario. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, if the membrane data-sheet says it can only filter up to 47.3 m3/day, how did he find out he needed only 12 of those for his water flow, even though it is much grater than 47.3\*12 per day?

&amp;#x200B;

In our facility there are a fair amount of VAV's with reheat coils that are supplying an air temperature I believe is too low. I'm trying to calculate the theoretical air temperature they should be supplying.

So I would assume it's a simple heat transfer problem no? Equate Q=mcT for both mediums then solve for T for air? The units are currently outputting 26C air.

Given: 

* Entering air temperature - 13C
* Density of air - 1.2KJ/L
* Sp. heat of air - 1KJ/KG K
* Air flow - 100L/s

Now the givens for the water in the heating coil:

* Entering water temp - 32.6C
* Leaving water temp - 26.9C
* Density of water - 1KG/L
* Sp heat of water - 4.18KJ/KG K

However, when I do my calculations i'm getting a number in the high 30's. Also to note, the water temperatures are measured at the supply/return points for the entire system, not just across a specific VAV. I would assume that's why I'm getting such a high number. Any help would be appreciated.

For some background, I just graduated with my BS in mechanical from a mid-ranked school.  My resume is ok but not great...GPA below 3.0, one internship, and some projects through clubs.

Throughout undergrad I also worked in the university machine shop / makerspace as a technician. It's been a good experience.  They've given me an offer to stay on full time as a senior tech, but I'm having a tough time deciding if it's a good or bad career move.  

**Pros**

- Lots of freedom.  The job has a ton of down time and I essentially have carte blanche to work on side projects.  

- Tuition is waived after 1 year of employment.  I could get my master's or a second degree at no cost.  This is something I never considered in the past.  

- Low stress, great benefits.

**Cons**

- Mediocre pay, about 30% less than the average starting salary for an engineer in the area.

- Little room for growth.  Guys who work here do the same job or move one or two levels up over 30 years.  

On one hand it's very appealing as I'm comfortable here and the salary is certainly more than I make now and is enough to live on.  My friends are telling me I'd be crazy not to stay for a few years to get my master's or MBA (long-term I'd like to get into the management side of things).  On the other hand I'm worried about the loss in salary and career stagnation.  I started things late and am already in my 30's, so there's a rush to get things moving.  I've gotten a few interviews from other companies and I feel pretty confident I could find an entry level engineering position relatively quickly if I keep applying.

The treatments are ambient (fluctuating with natural outdoor exposed temps), but the pelt units will create a little extra cooling in some treatments, or a little extra heat in others. 

Right now the idea is to link the treamtnets so that the wast heat from one side of the plate heats a treament, and the other cools it. 

I purchased a 12v 0-5 amp table variable top power supply to do this. 

My question to you engineers... will passive (just a heat sink on each side of the pelt unit, no fan) conduction/convection of heat from the pelt plate be enough to add about +/- 1-2*C to these outdoor treatments, or will I need a fan on each heat-sink to reach that efficiency on the plates? 

The idea is that the pelt will sit between two Styrofoam containers with a heat sink sticking into each container. The containers won't be sealed so that heat or cool air doesn't build up. 

If I do need to use fans, what is the best way to wire and power a bunch of computer fans? Should they be in series or parallel? 

Same question for the pelt units themselves.

I´m a documentary filmmaker based in Spain, and I recently came across a very interesting character who claims to have designed a flying craft that works using gyroscopes as propellers.

He also claims that the whole motor could run on clean energies, such as solar, energy it draws from sound or hydrogen separation.

I don´t have a scientific, nor engineering background, but of course I suspect this is not a possibility or even if it is, it´s definitely not a very efficient one.

But then again he is a great documentary character and his ideas are very well intentioned and in line with the current times we live in, so there’s definitely a lot to talk about, even if his craft is completely bogus.

What I am trying to ask of this community is: is it possible to attempt any kind of somewhat doable / meaningful experiments around the technology this guy talks about, so that I can base the film around the process of these experiments and its outcomes or is this absolutely impossible?

Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post but I really need some help.

So basically I'm trying to figure out all of this but am struggling to. 

I think i got the ' f(V/A)' part mostly sorted ( 'f' being about 0.4 - 0.3 ( i think) because this is to do with the tip of a Battleship shell, V is 850m/s (but I just put it down as 850 in the equation, and A is about 2m^(2) (I just put it down as 2) and I think it's supposed to be only the area that would face all the resistance so I got the area just for the tip.) but EVERYWHERE else I'm just lost.

I have an idea for a product but it requires me doing all the math/aerodynamics everywhere else in order to make it work properly and to see if it will stay fast enough but I only started studying all this today and think I might need help.

The CO2 sensors installed have a self-calibrating routine that tries to reset the low PPM reading to sea-level (400ish), but the altitude of the facility is above 7,000'.

From a controls stand point, I clearly measure a rise in CO2 during occupancy and ventilation sequences appear to control the readings.

The managers questions were: 1) is CO2's toxicity derived from the raw concentration, or is it based on a ratio of the other ambient gases? 2) is a set point of 600 PPMs still adequate/appropriate with the self-recalibration routine at the sensors?

I believe the facility manager's goal is to reduce the amount of ventilation when it is sub-zero to save energy, but he sincerely doesn't want to jeopardize his student's and faculty's health.

I shot from the hip and explained that the mechanical engineer's design would be in accordance with ASHRE, but I wonder a little myself.

I graduated back with a Mechanical Engineering bachelors in March from a top 20/top 50 (I never know with university rankings) school with a 3.5 GPA and currently job hunting in the Bay Area. But I don't have any engineering internship/job experience so I don't think I'm all that valuable. Here's my resume for reference.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/hlcu60deo60gkp6/Anonymous_Resume.pdf?dl=0

After a month of job hunting, I just got a job offer as a Manufacturing Engineer for 62k. It's definitely on the lower end of pay, especially for the Bay Area.

I've done research with online salary calculators and I think the market value of an entry level Manufacturing Engineer hovers around 70-75k but feel free to fact check me.

I kind of want to just get my feet wet and just get some damn experience. I'm living with family so rent/food costs aren't *too* much of a concern but I'd rather have a job sooner than later. I haven't had any promising leads other than this job after a month of searching, which I know is relatively short but I'm not eager to go back to the hunt. ""I'll take what I can get"" is what I'm saying here.

**But getting more money is good. But am I in a position to negotiate?**

Now I guess the reason I'm making this post is that I'm afraid I don't have any leverage to negotiate. But I'm more afraid that they'll rescind my offer if I negotiate with them. 

I don't have any experience. I don't have any other offers lined up. I don't want to be jobless right now. My resume is probably a dime a dozen.  

According to Glassdoor reviews this company is notorious for average to low compensation. Which is fine to an extent. I don't mind looking for a different job after a year or so of work there. I want experience but there's such a thing as too low. I was thinking about asking them for 70k since that's what I initially asked for.

Sorry, I know I'm rambling here. [Here's a picture of a cat.

**tl;dr**: Entry level manufacturing engineer position offer at 62k in Bay Area. I have no engineering job experience and have been out of school for 6 months. Not hopeful about future job prospects Key questions are...

* Do I have leverage with no experience?
* Would it be advisable if I take the job mostly to gain experience or is the compensation so disgustingly low that I should hold out for a different offer?",False,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,98943.0,public,self,Negotiating Salary as a newly grad with no job experience,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/9m1nra/negotiating_salary_as_a_newly_grad_with_no_job/,all_ads,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They claim they will use the same cutting tool and the new machine has tighter controls and so they can forgo fatigue testing on the new parts.  The machine is cutting threads in titanium for a critical application.  I know that machining causes some surface residual stresses but I don't think it would be possible to measure the residual stress at the most critical point in the root of the thread.  The part does get shot peened afterward which should relieve the stress, but again I don't know that the shot will reach the thread roots.  While going to a new machine sounds better, is there any to prove they are making identical parts without going through fatigue testing?  Fatigue testing can be very sensitive to certain factors.  One thought that came to me is that an older machine is probably largely bulky with lots of cast iron or steel and a new one is likely lighter.  Would that lead to potentially more vibration that could make some un-measureable changes in the final product.  Or do new machines have a way to offset this?

I graduated last March from a pretty well known school with a GPA hovering around 3.50. I don't have any internships and I know I shot myself in the foot there, but that's the reality. 

I've only started job hunting earlier this month because I honestly wasn't quite ready to join the workforce quite yet. Now that I've started applying I realize that I shouldn't be too picky with what job I want. While I would love to do something involving robotics, I need some engineering experience to start off with.

But I recently applied to a Field Service Engineer role and the company said   I wasn't a good fit for the engineer role, but if I wanted to get my foot in the door, I could be in consideration for a Field Service Technician role. I politely declined, but I'm wondering if I'm being too picky. 

I've read horror stories of people who get pigeon-holed into technician roles or how technician jobs look bad on an engineering resume. But is there any merit to that? A family friend (who's an EE who went into management) said that I shouldn't be too selective and I should be looking into applying to technician roles as well.

I don't know. What are your guys' thoughts about this? BTW, here's my resume if you want to tear it apart.

I would like to share with you a concept that I've had in mind for a long time. I will also share my concept drawings and relevant images and footage. 

Below, you will also find a few clips of similar constructions from other people.

This is a reimagining of the Hookblade from Assassin's Creed: Revelations:https://i.imgur.com/zdSaVUI.jpg

The purpose of the wristhook (haven't figured out a name yet) would be to enhance the natural reach of the hand, and removing the strain on the hands therefore making climbing walls and rocks nearly effortless. This is mainly oriented towards adventurers who do a lot of rock climbing and freerunners who want to increase their reach when climbing walls.


My goal would be to build it myself or pay an expert to build it for me, test it and then 


The mechanism used would be a double action out the front system, with the trigger being a ring resting in the palm, with a strap attached to the mechanism that one would put their middle and ring fingers in and pull outwards, in a manner that would resemble Spider-Man shooting webs.


Once pulled, the hook would shoot out, and stay rigid until the mechanism is pulled again, after which it would slide back in.


The hook itself would be bent somewhere between 30 and 45 degrees, in order to fit into most nooks and crannies of modern architecture, between tiles or simply on rocks.


The elongated part would consist of one segment or two, whichever gives more durability and safety. One could perhaps also choose between the two for longer or shorter reach.


This Wristhook should be made of a material sturdy enough to hold a bit more than the weight of an average adult man, and ideally a lot more, since there would be a lot of situations that applied a lot more stress on the device. 


It should also be able to hold a person for long amounts of time without bending or breaking, and not be too heavy to be considered a burden to the user.


The device would have the appearance of a large bracelet strapped tightly around the forearm, perhaps with somwthing like a strap to further distribute the weight and prevent slipping. Once greenlit for selling, it would have a lot of different designs, like modern, minimalistic, carbon fiber designs or more rustic designs like wood et cetera.


Here are some sketches I made that further illustrate the look and overall design: https://www.dropbox.com/s/n4m3xj5shmgz79r/IMG_20180919_175455.jpg?dl=0

Please let me know what you think! 

What material would you construct it from?
What mechanism would you use instead? 
How much weight could it carry at most? 
Would you be interested in using it yourself?

Tall stone towers are pretty common in fantasy settings, but I'm wondering how realistic they can be. In real life the highest primarily stone structure is the Washington Monument and was built in the 1860's, standing 169 meters tall, but many towers in fiction seem much higher than that. Often their incredible height is just hand-waived by making it out of magical materials like Orthanc (Saruman's tower) in *The Lord of the Rings*, but often there is no explanation as to how a stone tower can reach the proportions of modern skyscrapers.

But lets say that an emperor in a standard high fantasy setting asked you to build the highest possible tower for his palace at the center of his capital city. The base can't be wider than 30 meters (100 feet). You have access to real life medieval materials, with similar abundance and value compared to real life in the late Middle Ages. Any fantasy material could only be ornamental and magic won't help you make it stronger.

I have a puzzle for you:

I need to accelerate a ~250kg mass to provide around 140kN of feed force at 50m/s^2 up to 1 m/s speed, maintain that speed for 0.1s and then take it back down to stand still at the same rate or faster. Servo motors and ball screws are preferred.

Must be done in a controlled and adjustable manner, nothing explosive. Also, absolutely no hydraulics.

The torque requirements to get that mass up to speed, along with the spin up of the motor internals themselves look crazy. The best idea I've come up with so far is using a compressed air shot to jump start the acceleration, have the motors take over, and again use an air brake to decelerate.

(It's awesome.) I've got a question about shaft diameter that no one has stumped all my instructors and dive partners. 

Spearguns are basically a cross between a slingshot and a crossbow. The rear end of the spear is locked into the trigger mechanism on the gun, then elastic bands are stretched from the muzzle of the gun and hooked behind a small catch at the rear of the spear. [Here's a photo.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1315/4801/products/Standard3-top-side.gif?v=1489084408) 

Spear shafts are solid steel, and are available in 6.5 mm, 7 mm, and 7.5 mm diameters.

Most guys get narrow shafts because the lighter weight leads to a faster muzzle velocity.  Which I agree with. 

But they assume that faster muzzle velocity also means a longer effective range. And I'm not so sure. Water is heavy, and it seems like a heavier spear might be able to travel farther before running out of momentum.  

My question: Holding the shaft length and speargun power are constant, what effect does shaft diameter have on the maximum range and terminal ballistics of the shot?

I'm working on a woodworking art project and needed two cents from an engineer(s). I'm making a rotating ship's wheel. The question I have is about making the ship's wheel rotate. I'm finding I don't even know the right terminology in order to research how to make the wheel spin.

The ship's wheel will be mounted to a post. I want the blue portion of the wheel to rotate. But there's a second portion of the wheel I also want to rotate. That's the red portion. It's a flat decorative disk that covers the center of the wheel. As you turn the blue portion of the wheel I want the red portion to turn half as much.

So if you turn the wheel 90 degrees then the red portion only turns 45 degrees. I'm trying to find some kind of gear or rotating device that would accommodate that. But again I know even know the right vocabulary in order to research that and figure it out.

So does anyone know of anything that could be mounted onto the wheel to allow it to rotate like that? I'm at a loss here. I wanted the wheel to have an average resistance to turning. Not turning at the lightest touch but also not taking two people to turn it.

To start I will specify the factors I've been working with so far:

I've chosen a vertical axis design because from what I've gathered it's a better fit for smaller scale applications and high turbulance areas, it's location is a cabin in a clearing of woods. The average wind speed for the area my turbine will be designed for is 4-5 m/s. The design of the turbine is not finished yet, but I desire high starting torque as I'm under the impression that will give me more consistent performance in low speed wind. To achieve this high torque in the simplest and cheapest way I've come up with, the turbine will be Double Rotor Savonius with one fin to slightly increase it's inherent low efficiency. I lack in understanding of turbine design, I don't know what measurements I need to take to determine tip speed ratios or even RPM. Any advice in this area is greatly appreciated.

The other component to this project of mine is the generator. This has been my main focus in my research and I'm confident in my ability to fabricate the neccesary parts but I still need to iron out several details, especially for safety precautions. The design is based around ""Axial flux alternators"" as I've seen them called, though I'm not certain if that is the correct term. My stator will consist of 9 coils in 3 phases wired in series. The coils will be wound with 20 gauge enameled wire reclaimed from motors. The permanent magnet rotor will have 12 1""×1/2""×1/8"" rectangular neodymium magnets with an individual gauss rating of 13800. I desire a 14v output at average wind speeds for charging a 12v battery, from what I've gathered I need to use Faraday's Law to determine how many turns are neccesary in my coils for 14v output at a given RPM. I plugged in 300 RPM and my wire diameter, magnet area and tesla rating and got ~116 turns per coil, does that seem fairly accurate or is there something I missed? I can link to the website I found the info on Faraday's Law if anyone is interested. 

Finally I want to address how to handle the voltage generated safely and simply. I know my alternator will produce 3 phase ac that needs to be rectified into dc before connecting to a charge controller. I also know that I need some form of dump load for high wattage from excessive RPM in the case of extreme wind. 

As far as progress so far, Ive ordered the magnets and epoxy resin for fabricating the generator and they should arrive this week. I plan to start winding the coils in the next couple days and hope to have a working prototype for testing in a week or two. I haven't started any work on the turbine itself but I know I want it to be roughly 4'x4' and 25' in height. Also I need to get my wiring completely figured out so I know what components to order, so far I know I need a full bridge rectifyer, ~500w resistor for a dump load, and some kind of charge controller. Also I'm not sure where the dump load gets wired into the circuit.

To conclude I want to state that this is just a fun passion project based on a newfound interest in electricity and surplus of free copper in my life. I will post updates as I complete different stages of the design if anyone would like to see how it turns out. Any tips or information regarding the different formulas and variables I've failed to address will make me happy.

I have seen a ton of similar stuff on the internet but nothing that really helps me figure out the solution. 

**The Problem:** A ""single dimension"" Mass-Spring system with a step input. (eventually will be a ramp input but I want to start simple)

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is almost exactly like the second slide on this slide share, except with out a damper. ([https://www.slideshare.net/SondiponAdhikari/base-excitation-of-dynamic-systems](https://www.slideshare.net/SondiponAdhikari/base-excitation-of-dynamic-systems))

&amp;#x200B;

I first set up my free body diagram, the input dimension is Y and and output is X \[to be consistent with the slide\].

&amp;#x200B;

**The sum of the forces  = mass\*x\_acceleration = K\_factor \* (Y - X) - mass\*gravity**

&amp;#x200B;

Divide both sides by mass and get the respect variables to either side.

&amp;#x200B;

**X\_accel + X \* (K/mass) = Y  \* (K/mass) - gravity**  // or // d\^2x/dt\^2 + x(t) \* (K/mass) = Y \* (K/mass) - gravity

&amp;#x200B;

And after this i'm at a loss on how to solve it. 

I tried Laplace Transform stuff and I just get an insane transfer functions. 

* (K/mass) - gravity is a constant so it becomes (K/mass) - gravity / s
* The left side becomes s\^2 + (K/mass)
* And the transfer function X(s) / Y(s) becomes **(K/mass) - gravity) / (s\^3 + s \* (K/mass))**

I can't figure out how to factor s\^3 + s \* K/mass to get it to a solvable Laplace transform.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have no idea how to solve the equation without this methods.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really frustrated I feel like this is a simple problem, but I've been stuck on it for three days. Everything i've found on the internet either ignore gravity for some reason, or is a mass-spring-damper system which brings in the extra s\^2 variable that makes it factorable to where you can use partial fraction decomposition to get it into values that you can use the inverse Laplace tables with.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I just missing something simple here? I took one Dynamic System courses last year, but it wasn't taught that well.

Shouldn't I go to the second model rather than the first model? Or does each machine come with a specified speed?

3- Indicate the coil entering dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures?

Does this mean the air dry bulb/wet bulb temperatures??? is it the same as the designed air temperature outside? If machine had a temperature of  32 degrees C and my air temperature is 38 or 29? Does this mean for 38 the cooling load increases and for 29 cooling load decreases. So I should select a machine with entering temperature bigger or equal to my temperature?

4-Check total load and sensible loads by machine? 

Okay, so there's a water flow rate specification this would also control the load. Assume I found one 5kw exactly equals my designed load but my flow rate is 0.4 kg/s whereas the machine flow rate is 0.3 or 0.5 kg/s? How will this affect my selection??

Just wanted to share my experience about converting a single hose mobile air conditioner to a dual hose one as older topics here are talking about it.

I wanted to do it because I realized after i bought my single hose ac (model supra blizair 3000) that when put on an air sealed opening on my window it would create a negative pressure effect in my room as the ac was pushing the room air outside and no outside air was compensating this.

As a result of this negative pressure the outside hot air would push to come into the room, making the ac useless.

So the goal of adding a second hose was to allow the outside air to be sucked in to cool the condensor then exit by the original exhaust hose.

It did not work because single hose ac are not designed to be air sealed so even if you put a second hose on the air intake there are still air sucked from your room and exhausted outside, creating a negative pressure effect in the room which forces the outside air back and makes the ac useless.

I tried to open the ac up to see if I could make the hot part air sealed myself but the compressor is so close to the condensor that it would require to cut the circuit open to move the compressor away from the condensor to be able to do that. The price of the needed tools, the gas refill and the time it would take are not worth the mod so instead of throwing it up I just gave the ac to a frigorist for free as they do have the needed tools and i bought a dual hose ac (could not install split in my appartment) which has air sealed condensor space so it works perfectly.

You can see all the pictures I took when opening the ac when i was trying to mod it here (hosted on my private web server): [https://ah1z.com:4443/owndoge/index.php/s/guU6V10UhRsI3bR#﻿](https://ah1z.com:4443/owndoge/index.php/s/guU6V10UhRsI3bR#﻿) (you can click on the top right to get a gallery view).

I have currently spent 2 years in college (started in 2016) studying Information Technology and have successfully switched to Computer Science. Starting this year - in September, I will be technically a 1st-year Computer Science student.

# **Currently**

I like writing software. My GitHub account at the moment has 4 projects.

However, I am afraid that in the future I might want to switch careers (say 5 years down the road) that involves hardware and my Computer Science degree will limit me. At the moment, with Computer Science, it is plausible that I will enter a software engineering career, but what if I want to switch to hardware engineering, I am afraid that Computer Science will limit my opportunities since from my understanding: a hardware engineering path will require a degree in Computer Engineering.

# **Issue**

I will have already spent 2 years in college when I start Computer Science - I will be practically at square one. I am going to estimate that I will graduate between 0.5-1 year(s) late (2021) while pursuing Computer Science. If I successfully switch to Computer Engineering, I will graduate maybe between 1.5-2 year(s) late (2022).

If I do plan to pursue Computer Engineering, I am going to have to add a year course to my courses this year, I am not even sure if I even can enroll in the said course without it interfering with every other course I plan to take - and I will be going over my course limit which I can't go over without submitting a petition.

Let's say I do enroll in the mentioned year course, I will be doing around 7 courses per term (14 in total) if I plan to pursue Computer Engineering. If I instead purse pursue Computer Science, I will be doing 6 courses per term (12 in total).

Does it make any sense to switch to Computer Engineering? Should I just stay in Computer Science and finish it at the least? If I do graduate in Computer Science, is it possible to pursue a Masters related to hardware? Am I just overthinking it?

Basically there is a box that needs a certain m3/s of air to be discharged every few minutes. There is a unit pulling the air out at a constant rate. This unit is connected to the box by one larger duct which branches into two smaller ones at the front and backend.

Here is a very basic schematic of the system. [https://imgur.com/a/vWoJSzt](https://imgur.com/a/vWoJSzt)

So I'll summarize the math.

Bigger duct diameter: 0.5 m

Smaller branched duct diameter: 0.25 m

Box: 100 m \* 10 m \* 5 m = 5000 m3

Discharge time: 5 min

Fan speed: 50 m / s

Math:

Discharge rate: 5000 m3 / 5 min = 1000 m3 / min

Exit (bigger duct) max pull rate: 50 m / s \* \[pi \* (0.5 m)\^2 / 4\] \* \[60 s / min\] = 589 m3 / min

Entrance (smaller duct) max pull rate: 50 m / s \* \[pi \* (0.25 m)\^2 / 4\] \* \[60 s / min\] = 147 m3 / min

But since there are two smaller ducts the pull rate from the entrance would actually be 2x and be 294 m3 / min correct? 

And if this is the case, the current setup can't handle the 1000 m3 / min rate, so a larger fan of \~170 m/s would be needed  or larger entrance and exit duct diameters would be needed correct?

# What's an average day like for an engineer?

One of the most common questions asked by people looking into a career in engineering is, *""What do engineers actually do?*"" or, *""What's an average day like for an engineer?""* While these questions may appear simple, they're a gateway to a vast amount of information... much of which is too vague or abstract to be helpful, and often fails to describe anything specific about engineering work.

To offer more practical information, AskEngineers hosts this annual Work Experience Thread where engineers can talk about their daily job activities and career in general. This series has been successful in guiding students towards the best major for them, and helping engineers better understand what their counterparts in other disciplines do.

Today's thread is for engineers who want to share their stories, advice, and collective knowledge with our community. The responses here will be archived in the AskEngineers wiki and made available as a public resource.

I could not find anything online regarding this. It's about pedantry/nitpickiness and physics/calculus so I figured /r/AskEngineers would enjoy it at least.

I'm taking an online Calculus II course and my instructor, while a fantastic teacher, is unnecessarily nitpicky.  I was docked 1/2 a point on a quiz for not indicating a negative velocity in my sentence conclusion for a problem regarding antiderivatives in the context of a physics problem.

My symbollic work answer was something along the lines of:

""v(5) = -48""

My sentence answer was something along the lines of: 

""The object hits the ground after 5 seconds with a velocity of 48m/s.""

My question to you is: 

Is it necessary to state whether the velocity is negative in the context of the problem when your sentence already gives an indication of direction.  The ground is obviously... on the ground. Logically, an object would have to be traveling in a down wards direction to hit the ground.  Stating a negative value for velocity in this context would be redundant--and technically indicate a -(downwards) direction meaning the object is traveling upwards, right?

This annoyed me and I would love nothing better than to nitpick a nitpicker.  I could be wrong, however I have not had an instructor say anything in any of my other physics/engineering/calculus classes...

My current knowledge about this stuff (actuators, motors, circuitry diagrams, flux capacitors) rounds to zero.  Most of the similar projects I found via search felt half-baked -- except [this one](http://www.instructables.com/id/RFID-cat-door/) -- and none of them use a motorized door.

**MORE INFO**

Always helps to clearly define the problem, so here are pics of the existing door and a gif of the flap mechanism.  Interior dimensions of the opening: 185mm x 185mm (7.25"" x 7.25"").

[Outside view.](https://i.imgur.com/2B0J5iH.jpg) Hinge is on the left; door flap moves horizontally.

[Inside view showing the door's movement on its hinge.](https://i.imgur.com/scF4yXZ.gifv) The door also has the same range of motion in the opposite direction, opening inward, though I'd prefer it open outward as shown here.

I drew a diagram but I was unable to upload it for some reason - there’s a link below but I’ll also describe my problem in case that doesn’t work. 

I have two pumps, Pump 1 and Pump 2. Each pump has its own reservoir, Reservoir 1 and Reservoir 2, respectively. Reservoir 1 is connected to a tee with tubing that has an ID of 3/32”. Reservoir 2 is connected to Pump 2 with tubing with ID of 1/16”. Pump 2 is connected to the same tee with 1/16” ID tubing. The output of the tee is connected to Pump 1 with 3/32” ID tubing. 

Pump 1 pumps at 3.25 mL/s and output of the setup was verified to be 3.25 mL/s. Pump 2 is set at 0.06 mL/s. However, when both pumps are running Reservoir 2 is found to be draining at an increased rate of 0.09 mL/s. This was expected but I’m having issues preventing this from happening. Any suggestions on ways I can ensure pump 2 flow rate will be unchanged?

Electrophysiologist-in-training here. I've recorded neurons in the brain receiving spontaneous inputs from other nearby cells. The amplitude of these responses is (theoretically) quantal (i.e. there should be distinct ""steps"" of amplitude response), however there are various sources of noise/decay that complicates the histogram from being nicely fit to a set of mixed gaussians (possibly even two distinct quantal sources in the response).

What I've done is binned the histogram into fine intervals (0.0001 pA) and taken an [FFT (please click to see graph)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ivbsa660ins4lj7/WhatWouldMakeThis.jpg?dl=0). When I look at the spectral power, I get lovely spikes at what could be my quantal response interval (presumably the lowest ""Frequency"" is my quantal interval. However, I'm seeing a good deal of what looks like harmonic responses.

My question is: Why? Is this just a property of a powerful low frequency signal and I should ignore these other harmonic bands? I'm expecting harmonics to decay with ""frequency"", so why does the pattern ""reflect back"" from the Nyquist point and decay back towards lower ""frequencies""? Are their electrical circuits that produce a similar response and what does it mean? Am I actually seeing anything useful at all?

Q = (k/s)A(T1 \- T2)

Where,

Q = amount of work energy to perform the function (W, j/s) 

k = thermal conductivity of the material (W/(m\*°C) \-\-\-\&gt; \[K of silicone is 0.14 W/(m°C) and K for fiberglass insulation is 0.033 W/(m°C)\]

s \- material thickness (m) \-\-\-\&gt; \[Silicone = .00127m and Fiberglass insulation = .0019m\]

A \- given area (m\^2) \-\-\-\&gt; ""at any given point"" can be an area 1 x 1 (units neglected) to equal 1 (thus ""A"" can be omitted)

T1 = start temperature (°C) \-\-\-\&gt; 210° C

T2 \- End temperature (°C) 

Now, I know that I will have to do this for each layer of material. The problem is that I have two unknows in each formula.

For the outer silicone layer, I can't calculate ""Q"" without knowing T2 and I can't calculate T2 without knowing ""Q"".

For the inner fiberglass layer, T2 is the new T1 (for the inner layer) \- which I do not know \- I do know the needed interior temperature though \-\&gt; 121 °C but this does me no good as I still don't know Q for the inner layer.

\*\*\*Note that I converted everything to SI because it is just easier for formulation\*\*

It seems that every avenue I go down, for this scenario, has me going in circles. I tried to calculate Q by using specific energy  (heat) \- but I would need to know temperatures again.

In the second case, if there were no exhaust fans, the RTU unit would effectively be pressurizing the building.

Maybe it's more of a physics questions. But I think it's the type of thing you guys would know about.)

Here's how I did it.

I assumed that I can treat the blade as if it was a flat panel flying perpendicular to the air. Of course, it's actually moving at an angle, but I don't know what the angle is, or what effect that has on the downforce. But it can't be more than the force with perpendicular motion.

The force on an object moving through air is defined by the drag equation:  

    F = .5 * rho * S^2 * A * Cd
    where:
    rho is the density of air (1.2 g/l);
    S is speed;
    A is frontal cross-section area;
    Cd is drag coefficient.

I rearranged to solve for speed:

    S = 1 / sqrt(.5 * rho * A * Cd / F)

Then I can have power:

    P = F * S

Force, for both of its instances, is the weight of the craft. I used the weight of an Apache, 17,650 lb.

For area, I couldn't find out how wide the blades are, so I referred to a [picture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/McDONNELL_DOUGLAS_AH-64_APACHE.png) I found on Wikipedia, and [this online ruler](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/tools/pixel-ruler.html). It seems the blades are about 25 pixels wide, and 586 pixels long. (Technically, it's two blades, but I couldn't measure just one, since it's partly hidden.) Wikipedia also says that the rotor diameter is 48 ft, so the blades must be 25 / 586 * 48 = 2.04778157 ft wide. I measured width near the tips, but it seems reasonably constant.

So, 

    F = 17650 lbf,
    A = 48 ft * 2 ft = 96 ft^2,
    rho = 1.2 g/l,
    Cd = let's say 1,
    P = 1 /sqrt(.5 * rho * A * Cd / F) * F = 12752.8255 hp

But the Apache's engine only has 2 x 1,690 = 3380 hp.

I've had trouble figuring out a balance between perfectionism _(not wanting to be a 'bad student', not wanting to disappoint professors who care about teaching, and wanting the best for their students, fear of submitting subpar work or slacking off)_ and realism _(""C's get degrees"", personal projects/extracurriculars/co-ops/internships/networking is more valuable than a perfect GPA)_. I don't really have strong opinions for how to tackle a term of classes, and what to prioritize. 

This term (January - April 2018), I approached it with a ""get straight A+'s"" mindset, and tried to work on building my work ethic and not letting anxiety get the best of me. Tweaked my study approach, worked on priming myself to put school first, didn't procrastinate, etc. and it was actually working. I went into finals this term with A+ grades in every course, felt happy and proud, told all my friends and family, and I felt confident in my ability to study and prepare. One midterm I got a 90 when the class average was 68, in a semiconductor materials course that is notoriously difficult. For once, I felt like a model student, and like I was finally doing what was expected of me. I didn't feel like a disappointment anymore.

In hindsight this led me to misjudge how prepared I was for my most recent final. This class has a final that's worth 60% of the grade, and I felt good about how I was going to do, only to walk in and have no idea how to solve anything. I had a panic attack in exam because it caught me completely off guard. My A+ is going to tank to a C final grade, and I felt so ashamed of myself. It was a fair final, though, and all I can do is take responsibility and learn from my mistakes in how I prepared for the exam. My pre-final grades weren't indicative of how I'd do on the final, and I fooled myself into thinking I was alright. 
 
I have to get back on the horse and keep studying, but I just feel so defeated. Why should I care? Like, all I need on this upcoming final is 15% to pass the course... if C's really do get degrees and A+'s don't matter, then what's the point? I feel lost and hopeless... I thought I had finally figured out how to get through my degree without feeling anxious and overwhelmed... I thought I had figured out an approach that worked for me, but it feels like months of hard work was for nothing... if all that's going to happen is a shitty letter on a transcript, then what's the point?

I’m an early 30’s engineer been working for 5.5 years at a state government level doing asset management and for the past 4.5 years project management in the transport infrastructure space (this is my first job). This mainly involves managing consultants and contractors to take a concept level design from our planners through to completion. 

I’m contemplating a move for a variety of factors;

1. Learnings, I’m starting to hit my ceiling regarding learnings, these are no longer work related and rather office politics, how do you get traction for an idea, communication channels and dissemination, hierarchy of decision making, codifying processes, business improvements.
1. Earnings plateau, I’ve hit my ceiling regarding earning through our enterprise agreement, this means that i can’t get a raise until I get a higher position
1. Industry Growth, I’m in australia and we are currently going through a infrastructure boom and finding a job should be relatively easy
Workplace dynamics, as a Gov organisation i’m relatively young given the median age of people is around the 45+ years old, meaning they’re having discussions of kids and school and i’m talking more about the state of the world or the next cool festival that’s on 

Reasons contemplating staying and have stayed;

1. Mastery, i’ve become proficient at this and am still building my skills at project management and have yet to undertake all types of transport infrastructure projects
1. Contribution, as i’ve been here doing project management for a few years I have a comprehensive grasp of what we do and we are in the process of going through an revising our framework
1. Comfort, change is difficult and i’m in a comfortably position where my commute is minimal, i enjoy the city i am in, i work flexible hours and i’m close to the city, leaving could mean i forgo any or all of these things

I’m writing to get advice from those who are in a similar position or have moved through similar things in their careers or anything thoughts or feedback.

I graduated from a military service academy some years ago with an engineering degree. I'm in my mid-30's now, and have begun paying attention to the alumni association of my college. I donated a few hundred dollars to a student scholarship fund that I benefited from when I was a student, and there is also a scholarship dinner coming up pretty soon that I've been invited to.

It's a fundraising dinner, and each plate is over $500 (affordable to me, but not chump change). Like most engineers, I don't exactly socialize with others as much as I could, and my wife thinks that I should get out there and press the flesh a little. My college has many alumni in my industry and I frankly could only benefit by networking more.

Best decision ever?  Worst?

I'm a (late 30's/early 40's) first line engineering manager (I directly manage ~20 engineers from several disciplines) of 3-5 years at a big well respected company that you have all heard of.  I really like the work my team does and the products we build.  They really do inspire me, everyone around me, and many people around the world.  The company has been extremely good to me over the years and I have absolutely nothing to complain about in terms of compensation, benefits, etc.  That's all really great.  I like working with, developing, and advocating for my engineers.  And I like getting shit done.  I'm really good at driving execution and efficiency (getting projects done on time and on budget or better), but honestly not that good with (or interested in) formulating strategy and selling it.  I have a ""no bullshit"" attitude that hampers my ability to be diplomatic.

Despite good performance ratings (I actually really like and get along well with my immediate boss), I'm honestly dissatisfied.  I don't believe I really have the right personality type for management.  I abhor the politics and the bureaucracy at my level and up the chain.  Many hours of my week are spent in pointless mandatory management meetings reviewing the same materials over and over and over and over.  I'm often not empowered to make decisions without significant oversight.  Lots of time is wasted on mundane topics and inability of my leaders to actually make decisions and stick to them (feels like decisions are often made in committee and then revisited continually in other committees).  I can feel my soul slowly being sucked out of me.  I have no desire to move up the chain (it's all politics up there).  But, since it's a huge company I might feel differently in a different division.  Though thus far I have been unable (and not for lack of trying) to get a lateral move to another spot.  I have two different B.S. degrees in engineering and an MBA.

I really just like working with numbers and analysis.  Writing code.  Improving tools and processes.  Inventing new ways to interrogate the data.  I've always liked jumping between engineering disciplines and exploring new things.  I get bored pretty easily (2-3 years in one position is usually enough for me).  So I'm very seriously considering going back to engineering.  I wouldn't be the first but I've witnessed the stigma on those who have preceded me.  There is a big part of me that thinks of going back as ""failure"" - like I just couldn't hack it.  I could ride this job for 15-20 more years and have enough to comfortably retire, put my kids through college, etc, etc.  But sometimes I'm super jealous of my engineers.  They present results to me for approval, I provide feedback, I guide them on what they should be looking for, I help them w/ messaging, I look for opportunities to develop them and fill in gaps in their knowledge/experience, and that's awesome.  But I'd rather be doing the engineering work.  I want to be working along side w/ them - not catching up with them in short stints between bullshit meetings that have no measurable purpose.  I could still ""lead from the trenches"" without all the overhead and could probably add more value to the company.

I don't know.  I'm rambling.  Thoughts on going back?  I'd really like to hear from others that have had similar thoughts or have actually done it.  It would help to know the situation, size of company, how it worked out, etc, etc.

My current salary is 28.5k (which I'm expecting to increase to 30k by the end of this year).

The Curtin program is just 4 years of straight engineering with an honours component (major final year project). No broadening units and non-engineering electives.

UWA on the other hand is 5 years, with the first 3 being a BSc (Engineering Science) which leads into a Master of Professional Engineering in the final 2 years. As I understand it if you leave after the first 3 years (or don't achieve the 65% course average necessary to make it into the masters) you're basically stuck, because the 3 year program isn't accredited. You would have to transfer to another uni and would be placed in 2nd or 3rd year. The first 3 years also has a bunch of broadening units and electives (from any school). You can also double major with pretty much anything else, where at Curtin you can't.

From what I've heard, in the state the 2 courses are basically seen as equal by employers. However I would like to work overseas and UWA is better recognised both interstate (it's one of the Group of Eight unis) and overseas. In terms of international rankings, UWA is 93 and Curtin is somewhere in the 260's.

Among other classmates and I are conducting a school project whose purpose is to create a company (whether you actually do it or not it is a different subject). Two of them are mechatronic engineers and proposed the idea of ​​creating a design company. 

The problem is that the other two members of the remaining team (other guy and I) have other careers, where we do not see mechanical design (I had Static and Dynamic classes, but no software), and we do not know how this market works.

Where I live there are not so many engineering companies, so I wrote them an email asking if they could help me and give me a quote. Of ten emails that I sent, only one answered, saying that he charged 25 dollars an hour, but he didn't explain much of the process that it takes (taking measurements? just drawing?). 

I'm thinking about calling by phone those companies, saying I have a (fake) design, and asking for a quote so they give me clear answers. But I still do not know how to do that, because I do not know what kind of design to ask for, or if I have to send some example drawings.

And my teammates are not very helpful, they are focusing on the technical part, but they do not know anything about prices ... costs ... I really asked them a lot how to do this, seems like they don't know either.

 Have you worked in such a company? Was it profitable? Did you have a market? (We are thinking that the main market would be SMEs but I'm not sure.) I have an idea that designs are expensive, but it usually includes the manufacture of the piece, and our idea is based mainly on pure drawing.

1 - Solução usual: Andei pesquisando e um motor de 500W/ 24V de 2500 rpm e torque de 1,9Nm, próprio para bicicletas elétricas, custa a partir de R$ 400,00. Ele teria que ser ligado em duas baterias de 12V em serie (que custam no minimo 70 reais cada).

2 - Minha ideia: Usar um motor de cortador de grama (R$100,00) de 500W/127V de 9000 rpm em um pinhão de uns 12 dentes, com uma corrente indo do pinhão do motor até a coroa da bicicleta de uns 50 dentes. Isso, segundo a física, levaria a uma redução da velocidade em 4 vezes e aumento do torque do motor em 4 vezes. A alimentação do motor seria feita atraves de duas baterias de 12V em paralelo ligadas em um inversor (R$70,00) 12V/127V que suporta 500W.

3 - Meus cálculos:
Potencia (W) = Torque (Nm)*Velocidade Angular(rad/s)
Sabendo que 1rpm = 0,105 rad/s

Motor de 500W/12V que custa R$ 400,00:
500 = 1,9x2500x0,105
Logo:
500 = 498,75

Motor do cortador de grama que custa R$100,00
500 = Tx9000x0,105
Logo:
T = 0,5 Nm

Porem, com a relação os pinhões: T = 2Nm e velocidade = 2250 rpm
O que seria bem semelhante ao motor de 24V

4 -  Conclusão: 
Pela grande diferença de custos entre o motor de 12V e o motor de 127V + Inversor 12V/127V, alguma coisa nas minhas considerações devem estar erradas. Gostaria de saber a opinião de voces. Será que a durabilidade do motor de 127V é que seria muito menor que a do motor proprio para esse tipo de uso, fazendo a diferença de custo deixar de valer a pena?

By now I've been studying control theory for five weeks, and I don't understand much of it. I've gone to every lecture, and group study sessions, and watched YT videos and run MATLAB code, but I still lack any context or foundation. It feels like trying to learn to read French law books, without any previous training in French or Law. 

So I'm going to ask some very, very basic questions, and hopefully I can use the answers to understand the answers in the lecture notes. In some cases I *think* I know the answer, but want to know for certain before it makes me misunderstand something. Thanks in advance for your time. 

What are poles?

What is an impulse?

What is a domain?

What is an S-plane?

What is K? More accurately, how does it relate to gain?

The root locus diagram plots the damping factor (r) against the oscillating frequency (theta). I understand that the damping factor make systems less sensitive to input, but what does oscillating frequency control? And why does there need to be a separate value for damping, when K makes the system *more* sensitive to input, so why can't you reduce K instead of increasing r?

Placing your system outside of the path traced by the poles as they move around the graph in response to K increasing, makes it unstable. What does system stability mean in this context? I've seen graphs of the output shooting off to infinity as an example of an unstable system, but I don't think it's telling the whole story. 

I'd like to thank you again now, and also ask that if you can't spare the time to answer my questions, please direct me to somewhere that can.

RC equation (no axial diffusion): https://imgur.com/a/5yBSk

My first problem in understanding this is why the source term is multiplied by a density (if that's what it is, the document doesn't specify what exactly rho (p) is, but I assume it is the density of products. If I'm not wrong, every group of terms in either equation must result in units of mol/(L*s), or more generally, concentration per time. If this is true, then rho must be dimensionless since R' is probably already in these units.

This problem carries on when I nondimensionalize the equation to: https://imgur.com/a/Uf4Iv

In this way, the first term on the right side cancels out (no axial diffusion still), but the source term is still multiplied by  rho(p) * length/velocity, where length/velocity is equal to the residence time (Tau).

If it's not clear, my question is why is rho(p) in this equation, I've never seen it written like this. If it stands for density, then what are its units, as it seems from the above pictures that it doesn't have any units whatsoever.

She has since accepted one offer but with no tentative start date (apparently company is pretty notorious for long processing times and overall bad communication during the on boarding process). Pay is good (in the 80's), has good benefits, and has good travel opportunities but slightly worried how much she will enjoy the work (still computer engineering related)

Given she hasn't reached a full year at her current company, she would have to take out a loan to pay back the 10k she received for relocation/sign-on bonus (isn't prorated). It does help she doesn't have any student loans.

I recently graduated from university, but I'm still helping out with some of the clubs that I was involved with while I was there. One of the clubs is centered around building low cost assistive medical devices, mainly prosthetic hands, for children. Up until now, they were entirely mechanical; however, this year they are looking to add servos and other electronics to them to make them a bit more versatile.

I am currently tasked with designing the power system for the hands. The hands will have 3 servos and a supporting microcontroller. The total worst case (all servos stalled) current draw would be 5a at 5v, for a total of 25W. The problem I am having, and the reason why I ask, is that I am unsure of what would be a good solution. My first thought was to use lithium ion cells, as I'm familiar with lipo's from my experiences with rc aircraft, as I know that lipo's can be very small, give out a ton of current, and can have a usable voltage with just two cells, or a single cell with a booster circuit. However, as these batteries are likely going to be internal to the hand, lipo's don't seem like a good idea due to their propensity to be... unstable... if not treated well, which children tend to not do. I also am familiar with the more traditional lithium cells as 18650's, which I know can do similar things. However, while these have a hard outer casing, and seem to be more tolerant to abuse, they also can catch fire just the same. I know that there are more lithium-ion chemistries out there, but haven't used any of them personally.

Would using a LiFe battery or Lithium IMR battery be a better choice?

Additionally, in regards to charging the cells, we are likely going to try and make the hands chargeable without having to remove the batteries, which would then involve building a charging circuit, or using a module. This is tricky for me, since I haven't really seen an off the shelf charging module that can charge 2 cells in series (aside from stand alone balance chargers), but plenty of single cell charging modules. Texas Instruments makes a nice set of IC's that can handle multiple cells, but that would involve having to build our own PCB, which while not off the table, is not as desirable.

I've had one job since college.  The position's official title is naval architect, but it's not really.  As far as design goes, I mainly design small metal foundations for various equipment that goes on naval warships.  It's a neat job.  I make models in AutoCAD 3D and analyze them for shock loads in our FEA software.  Sometimes I get to do hand calcs to prove a design's acceptability and it's awesome.

**I've been doing this job now for about 3 years.  I recently transferred to a different office (same job) and things are quite a bit different.**  I'm told this new office does about 90% installation drawing development.  I've been told that hand calcs are too inefficient and that they're effectively banned (save for a quick back of the envelope calc to get a general idea of a design starting point).  I was even told - joking, or maybe not - to take my engineering books home because ""you won't need them here.""  **Since I took this job a couple of months ago, I have done 100% AutoCAD drawing development.**  And I'm not happy doing this.

Let me just throw out here that I have the utmost respect for a good CAD technician.  I've seen some of the guys at my office chew through a 10 page drawing in a couple of days and it needs minimal corrections!  Very impressive.  But that's just not what I want to do every day.

**I've made the decision to switch jobs, but I'm not sure that what I want is even obtainable.**  Everything I read on these forums suggests that offices use RISA, FEA software, or some equivalent for everything.  I don't know if hand calcs are even done anymore.

**I kinda feel like everything I worked to learn in college is worthless because it can be done faster and easier by a computer.**

I'm not trying to find a job where I sit at my desk all day and ponder the minutiae detail of stresses in a complex shaped plate or something.  I know employers don't have time or money to pay me for that.  They want results.  But at the same time, I don't really see how an engineer is really *needed* to draw some boxes in RISA and pick beam sizes until they stop being colored red after you run the analysis.

I have a couple of job paths to choose from right now.  I mainly just don't want to end up sitting at my desk and hating my job again or feeling like everything I've learned is worthless in 3 years.  Maybe I'll try to switch over to project management or field engineering so I don't feel trapped in the office all day.

So, what do you think?   Am I chasing a unicorn here?  **Is there job where you actually get to apply engineering principles daily and use math to solve problems rather than just feeding inputs to software and analyzing results?**

* Bold comments are the TLDR/main points.
* Hand calcs here mean anything where you might use equations from the various college classes to solve a problem directly vs feeding inputs into a computer.  For example, using M/S to find bending stresses in a beam instead of drawing the beam in SkyCiv to just ""get the answer.""  Or maybe working on non-standard designs that aren't easily input into analysis software.
* I hope this doesn't sound condescending.  I reread this a couple of times and rewrote a few sentences just to avoid that.  I'm not trying to disparage anyone's career choice.

[Here is a link to some screenshots of the Sketchup drawing I created.](https://imgur.com/a/VHRBZ)

[Here is a link to the actual Sketchup file if you have access to the software.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Bh75iVzvfcxzG7w5HCGtXNI8zIaOeuoI)

 Here are the basics of the repair. A roof cricket located at a chimney chase deteriorated and leaked water for a long time. It went undetected for too long due to the sneaky path of the water. The framing was damaged in this section and is about to be replaced. 

To remove the damaged framing, I'll have to support the load the wall was carrying. The parts that will be replaced in this section are the subfloor, bottom plate, studs, and the double top plate. The rim joist managed to survive with zero damage, thankfully. Exterior wall and roof sheathing will be replaced after the framing section has been repaired.

I have added a total 6 jack posts to carry the load of the roof. The first 3 jack posts are located in the bedroom with the damaged framing. On top of these three jack posts is a 10' 4x4 piece of lumber that is running underneath the bottom chords of the truss roof. The bottoms of the jack posts are directly on top of a floor joist. On the first floor, directly underneath these jack posts, are another 3 jack posts. These jack posts have the same 4x4 lumber on top of them, but it is running the length of the floor joist above. They are adding support to the floor joist that the jack posts of the second floor are sitting on top of. The first floor of the house is concrete slab. The jack posts of the first floor are sitting on top of a 10' long 2x6 piece of lumber (laying on it's side), that is directly on top of the concrete slab.

The jack posts are located 4' in from the outer edge of the bottom plate and rim joist. That location was chosen for subfloor replacement. I'd like to be able to get the biggest possible piece of subfloor installed while removing this wall, and of course the jack posts would be in the way, so my current compromise is that 4' mark. It does leave a significant portion of the roof trusses cantilevered from the support of the jack posts. This is my primary concern, and biggest question. Do the jack posts need to be moved one or two joists closer?

I will be adding a new vertical piece of webbing to each of these Fink Trusses for reinforcement. It will fall at about the point where the jack posts are supporting the trusses. 

The floor joist that is sandwiched between jack posts has been reinforced to withstand the new strain from these jack posts and to give it a wider surface area to support.

A few other notes and details... The floor joists are 16"" on center, and so are the wall studs. The roof trusses are 24"" on center. The strange looking, incomplete, floating framing in the drawing is the chimney chase. Any of the oddly spaced wall studs all have to do with chimney chase framing. The jack posts are rated at about 9000lbs each in compression at their current extension. The house was built in 1979. The rafters are 12' long 2x4s. All framing is of 2x4 stock with the exception of the floor joists. There are metal mending plates connecting all truss parts , but are not pictured. The three cylindrical columns on each floor of the drawing are the jack posts and their proposed locations.

The Sketchup drawing detail is extremely accurate, down the inch.

The studs, truss bottom chords, and chimney chase framing parts are all labeled in the drawing. I will be replacing the stud section of framing (including equivalent plates) running from S2 thru S10. The bottom chords supported by the jack posts are R2 thru R6.

It will be interesting to see how this matches with my recently completed CAD course. I'm also starting to mess around with arduino which should introduce me to electronics and programming. I'm sort of hoping that by this time next year I can start tying it all together and make some sort of cool project that really tests my skills.

In a lot of them she cries when mentioning falling down before reaching the toilet, bed, or dinner table. Sometimes this results in accidents, sleeping on hardwood, or laying on a linoleum floor for hours until someone comes home to help her up. It sounds like the problem is solved once she's back upright, but if her upper half reaches the ground she doesn't have the strength in her arms or legs to get the weight of her torso up (and she isn't overweight by any means). I desperately want to help find a way for her to at very least get herself to a rolling chair so she can get from room to room. 

Unfortunately my degrees are in the soft sciences- I only remember that pulleys, gears, levers, etc will reduce how much effort it takes to move something. As a kid I was so lightweight that pressing on the height lever of an office chair would actually raise me instead of lowering the seat, so that came to mind. I remember as a kid lifting my friends on a hydraulic jack inch by inch with ease, but I don't know what I can use to get the 4 feet of lift needed for her to straighten her legs underneath her. 

What are some lifting methods with a high actual mechanical advantage that could be used in the design of an in-home device?

I saw Goodyear Eagle RS-A2 245/45R19 and 19"" Cyclone wheels, but finding data for either one was difficult. I used the chart and used a rough estimate of .1 which is probably wrong and could have influenced my final value. 

I hope this was somewhat easy to follow because I would really like to have my worked checked. My answers don't seem ridiculously off, so I think they're a decent estimate.

I had this experience just now while watching the spacex CRS-13 stream.

When the dragon solar array deployed we got some clear shots of the rear of the panels. The white panels have some black details, lines and spots which look like conduits of some sort. 

Where the lines pass through the circular spots they deviate from their regular rectangular shape into a little S that passes through at 90 degrees from the ""regular"" direction. I have circled an example in green in the picture linked below. I've also circled one of the black spots in blue. 

I'm most curious about what this deviation might be. But I'd also like to know what these lines and shapes actually are! My total guess is that the little S bend might be something that can add some flexibility in case of vibration, or expansion and contraction due to changes in temperature?

I'm doing a lab where I'm investigating the effect of number of N poles (and their total strength) and the number of S poles (and their total strength) in the resultant magnetic field strength through a ferromagnetic sphere.

So a brief overview of my experiment: For each configuration, the magnetic bars are arranged in a tetrahedral shape around a small iron sphere. All N poles have the same magnetic field strength and all S poles have the same magnetic field strength. (but their magnitudes don't equal each other)

- Configuration #1: 4 N poles, 0 S pole

- Configuration #2: 3 N poles, 1 S pole

- Configuration #3: 2 N poles, 2 S poles

- Configuration #4: 1 N pole, 3 S poles

- Configuration #5: 0 N pole, 4 S poles

For all configurations, the dependent variable is the measured magnetic field through the iron sphere.

My question is, how can I quantify the independent variable?

Right now I have calculated ∑(N poles field strength) and ∑(S poles field strength), and thinking of either using the difference or ratio between them. The problem with ratio is, however, on config #1 and #5, depending on whether I'm calculating the ratio N:S or S:N, I get a div/0 for at least one of them. (and I need minimum of 5 independent variables)

With an LTI system, input sine waves can only be transformed via an amplification factor and a phase shift. The Bode plot shows the amplification and phase shift for any input sine wave for all frequencies.
Ergo, if I take a simple stable LTI transfer function, e.g. P(s) = 20/(s^2 + 9), the output frequency should match the input frequency, just with a phase shift and amplification based off the value I look up.
If I take the Bode Plot of this system, I see a positive magnitude and a 0 degree phase shift for w = 1 rad/sec. However, if I go into Simulink and input a 1 rad/sec sine wave into this transfer function, the output signal isn't a simple sine wave, but a signal made of the summation of several sine waves operating at different frequencies. This behavior is apparent at several other frequencies as well (.5 rad/s, 2 rad/s, etc)

The scooter is an [m5](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ecoreco-m5-electric-scooter-black/4780600.p?skuId=4780600&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;ksid=e58f6372-7a73-4dff-b724-6007e96916c2&amp;ksprof_id=14&amp;ksaffcode=pg245768&amp;ksdevice=c&amp;lsft=ref:212,loc:2) eco reco. They go for about 1k but with the parts I’ve found it could be fixed for $100. 



The motor is brushless and 300 watts. The battery is fried so we have some 36 volt hoverboard batteries that should work. The motor controller that comes with it won’t work with anything but the battery eco reco sells and they charge almost $400 for it. I found one on [eBay](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rhlqmz5urp4g304/Screenshot%202017-11-17%2015.33.39.png?dl=0)  that comes with a throttle to simplify things. 

Diagram of motor [controller](https://www.dropbox.com/s/786ht9c2l930web/Screenshot%202017-11-17%2015.33.43.png?dl=0) 

 So the battery one would connect to the battery (which is the same connector or does it get changed? My brother says the connectors are arbitrary and can be cut off and the wires can just be soldered together) and the hall lines is the hall sensor by the motor, the throttle plug pictured plugs in there too and the motor connects as well. How does the speed get changed? in the picture of the original motor controller there were some speed plugs but I don’t understand.

The original charger was three pins xlr. I’m looking for a charger thats 36 volts and preferably 4 amps. I’m not sure how these batteries wired together would be converted to work with a charger say [like](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lrmsnt29qryx5nk/Screenshot%202017-11-17%2015.18.02.png?dl=0)

He said I could wire the xt60 connectors to the three pin style. 

I’m wondering if I’m on the right track and if anyone has any guidance on how to complete this. Any advice helps.

This is actually my first post here on Reddit. So, I'm having a dilemma about how I want to do my grad school in Aero Engr. Here is my situation:

I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering and I've been working for 2 years in Design for Manufacturing at a manufacturing plant. While I work with a pretty good team, the work itself is not super interesting and can be quite aggravating at time, especially when I work more on the quality side vs. spending time solving design manufacturability problems. So I've been thinking about going back to grad school.

I've narrowed down to what I'm interested in studying if I go back. I've been very interested in these 2 fields: aeroelasticity and/or aeroacoustics, since I have always wanted to work with something dealing with aerospace and vibrations/dynamics. Now these 2 fields, I think, sound very specialized and would require a good education and experience package. But my current job really doesn't seem that relevant other than giving me ""real engineering job"" experience. So here is my dilemma:

1) If I continue working where I work and take online MSAE classes part time, does that make me less qualified for some jobs since I won't have a lot of real ""aerospace"" work experience?

2) Or should I go back to school full time and work on relevant researches/interns in order to improve my chance of getting into the fields I wanted? And for those who know anything about these fields, is a MS good enough or do I even need to pursuit a PhD? Or would a PhD be an overkill in terms of qualifications?

3) For people in aerospace engineering industry, what are some potential jobs in your field for these subjects and are some of them in high demand or need a constant supply of engineer?

I know financial hardship would be a real thing if I decide to go back to school full time but I would try to work that out with some kind of assistantship/fellowship.

I really want to hear some opinions and suggestions as well as what people involved with those fields have to say since I've spent sometimes thinking about what I'm really passionate about and I think I've figured it out.

P/S: I'm currently living in Central Alabama, so if anybody have any school recommendation or even potential employers and jobs in the South area, please let me know too. Thanks a lot!

This is actually my first post here on Reddit. I've read a lot of threads on Reddit about various things and figure it's time for me to ask for some opinions too.

So, I'm having a dilemma about what I want to do for my graduate engineer education. So here is some background about me:

I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering and I've worked at a tire plant for 2 years doing Product Design Validation. While I work with a pretty good team, the work itself is not super interesting and can be quite aggravating at time, especially when I get into administrative stuffs rather than spending time solving design manufacturability problems. So I've been thinking about picking up grad school again.

I've narrowed down to what I'm interested in studying if I go back. I've been very interested in these fields: **aeroelasticity** and/or **aeroacoustics**, since I have always wanted to work with something dealing with aerospace and vibrations/dynamics. Now these 2 fields, I think, sound very specialized and would require a good education and experience package. But my current job really doesn't seem that relevant other than giving me ""real engineering job"" experience. So here is my dilemma:

If I continue working where I work and take online MS classes related to those fields, does that seem like a waste of my time? Or should I need to go back to school full time and work on a relevant research/intern in order to improve my chance of getting into the fields I wanted? And for those who know anything about those fields, is a MS good enough or do I even need to pursuit a PhD (or is a PhD an overkill?)?

I know financial hardship would be a real thing given that I also own a house but I would try to work that out. I just want to get a clear picture of where I should take my career to next. I really don't want to wait for much longer since the idea of grad school would fade away if I wait more.

I really want to hear some opinions and suggestions as well as what people involved with those fields have to say since I've spent sometimes thinking about what I'm really passionate about and I think I've figured it out.

I just took my PE last Friday and am waiting for results. 

I graduated with my EE degree (with focus in power) in 2010. Interned at a firm for 2 summers and they ended up hiring me full time when I graduated. They placed me in their substation design department as an engineer. We worked with many different utilities both near and far. I was stuck in the office starring at drawings with the typical, (in my opinion) terrible office life. Same commute, same people, same grind every single day. It sucked. I lasted just over 3 years and left. 

My second (and current) job is working for the utility. In my case, I’m in power generation (we generate in one area and have T&amp;D in other areas). Our steam plants are 50+ years old. Literally. We have a bunch of “newer” gas turbine/peaking sites that are from the 70’s. I’m in the power engineering group, which is centrally located in an office. Our job is to support all the sites when shit hits the fan or when they want to buy new equipment. Basically I’ll be called if something blows up, a motor fails, something trips, we’re buying a new transformer/motor/breakers, a spec for material or work needs to be written, etc. This gets me out of the office quite frequently – which I enjoy. I’ve been here just over 3 years now, and it’s starting to get boring. Due to the fact that these plants are so old and I’m involved with just “patching” the issue, it’s getting old fast. The same sites, the same people. No new technology, all ancient shit. The repetitiveness over the years is what’s getting me I think. I’m a people person, no question. I like new things. I like change. I can’t seem to fathom accepting this process for the next 30 years of my life. Something has to change.

Assuming that I passed my PE, I’m going to be looking for a new gig pretty much immediately. This is where the problem occurs. I don’t exactly know what I want. Everyone who knows me says I would do amazing in sales. Not afraid to talk to anyone, outgoing, good people skills, etc. These are definitely not traits of your ‘typical’ engineer. This is all good and dandy, except for the fact that I have literally zero sales experience. I don’t know what a good sales gig is vs a terrible one. I wouldn’t know if the offer is gold or garbage. I work with many different vendors and reps from many different companies In my current position. I thought about reaching out to the ones that I’m closer with to see what they have to say about it. Aside from sales, I also thought about a field/apps engineer. That would put me on different projects in different locations pretty frequently. With my experience, this would probably be the “easier” option for me to land. Does anyone have experience in one, if not both of these roles? Which did you enjoy more? 

With all this being said, what else is out there for someone like me? I know there has to be opportunities that fit me that I haven’t thought about yet. I’d love to hear any and all your thoughts. Much appreciated!

I design, manufacture, and race downhill skateboards (these: https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18581109_1946227218945152_7123476690918965248_n.jpg). 

My friends and I are trying to break the current stand-up speed record of 89.41mph. 

There are a few of us ranging in weight from 110lb to 220lb. What I am really trying to find out is how much of an advantage our 220lb friend has over the rest of us.

I know, in freefall, all of the stuff here down to the graph is what I need:

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/75942/terminal-velocity-of-two-equally-shaped-sized-objects-with-different-masses

I would like to make that same equation/graph, but factoring in a slope. So, I added in ""sin(Θ)"" to the ""2gm"" part so that only the portion of gravity that is pulling us down the slope is factored in. 

Here is what I did on Wolfram Alpha so I can add numbers and solve for m/s:

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=square+root+((2(9.81)(50)sin(6))%2F((.18)(.905)))*((tanh(square+root(((.18)(.905)(9.81))%2F(2(50)))*3000)))

The 3,000 is in seconds, just so that it's close to terminal velocity after ""a long time"". The 50 is in kilograms. .18 is my CdA, and .905 is Rho at 10,000ft on a standard day.

But... I want to further simplify the equation to just being the relationship between terminal velocity down a slope (Θ) versus weight of the person.

 I know this assumes no friction and no change in altitude, etc. I just want to know the relationship between different weights and max speed on a given slope. That way we can figure out if it's even worth it for us all to try or just concentrate on making our 220lb friend as aerodynamic as possible by reducing his CdA and helping him practice.

He stated the ONLY way to calculate the pressure was using the height. While I agree, I offered an alternative that if you knew the weight of the water and the area of the drum's base you could also calculate pressure. He adamantly refused my assertion. I did some math showing both ways were correct, both methods yielded similar results. Can someone check to make sure I'm not missing anything.

The actual argument stemmed from my statement saying you can use a known weight and area to calculate pressure. Since we had ""round"" numbers for everything except the are of the base the math was easy (i.e. 55 gallons * 8 lbs/gallon), divided by area gives PSI. Using P = ρgh would have required ""non-round"" numbers and English unit fuckery (i.e. converting lb-mass to lb-force) in addition to measuring the height of the barrel.
While I agreed he was correct, my father-in-law refused to acknowledge that there was more than one way to calculate pressure. He didn't even want to listen to me when I mentioned the same unit analysis you brought up above. I gave him the hand calculations to show him I was right and he still didn't believe me. I've included a ""Copy"" of those calculations below.


Problem: Calculate pressure at bottom of a ""55-gallon"" drum using two methods. i.e. P = ρgh and P = F/A


Assumptions: gₐ= 9.8 m/s²

ρ(water) = 1000 kg/m³

FROM GOOGLE

Height of Barrel = 0.851m

Diameter of Barrel = 0.572m

Volume of Barrel = 0.2183m³

CALCULATED FROM ABOVE

Area Base = (0.572m)²/4 * π = 0.2570m³


Method 1


P = 1000 kg/m² * 9.8 m/s² * 0.851m

P = 8339.9 Pa


Method 2


P = F/A

F = m*a

m = ρ*V

therefore

P = (ρ*V*a)/A


P = (1000 kg/m³* 0.2183m³ * 9.8 m/s²) / 0.2570m²

P = 8324.9 Pa


A couple of notes. These aren't the same numbers I got when I did it by hand, but I'll assume rounding errors. Secondly, I assume that the amounts vary due to the different methods used and rounding as well since I used ""measured"" data from Google. Sorry I didn't use the plugin for formulas.

1) I have a concern that if I aim to get a degree (masters or ph.d) in neuroengineering and I gun for a role in management, I wont have the opportunity to be more hands-on in the design of the technology. Can anyone share from their experience if they work in management, but are still able to get their hands dirty? This doesn't haven't to specifically be in neuroengineering. 

Specific to neural engineering:
1) Any advice from current neural engineers around what expectations you had coming into the industry that were dashed? (e.g. pace of tech development is slow, product release to market hits a lot of road bumps, etc)
2) Do you know of any companies that are currently combining AI to develop brain machine interfaces and the how these bmis read data from our brains?
3) What specific job roles in the field have the most say over the strategic direction of the technology?

More than often those projects have completely different assemblies using the same parts (often custom parts, not just screws). The only location of a description of what the part or assembly is is located in a **handwritten stack of paper**- now into the 8000's of line items. 

This is incredibly frustrating to the other engineers who have not had a hand in the hundred or so projects the company has done. Try to go find a main assembly? Either search through the preview tab to see if the file is the one or ask the senior engineer what the number is for the project (good luck if he isn't there or doesn't answer his phone, which is often). Trying to make a package of drawings for a customer? Better hope the numbers in the assembly aren't split up for another project in the middle. 

The location of this holy grail of mess is a split server file, three folders down. Also in this sub,sub,sub folder labeled CAD. Client files, pdfs, old build procedures, pictures and random other files. 

This can't be the norm? Right?!?! HOW THEN? please dear lord help me in this unorganized mess. The sole reason for this is that the Senior Designer doesn't want ""double dipping"" where two part numbers could be the same if located in separate folders and relies on windows catching the two parts named the same. I think this is a total BS answer from someone who just doesn't want to change. 

One of the reasons I was hired was due to my level of organization, but this is insane. Don't get me started on revisions. 

&lt;end small rant&gt;

**Overall Question: There has to be a best practice to manage CAD files? Right? Whats the best way to manage this? Help would be great!**

Classes will start in a few days. In the dorm rooms I've met some guys who are in film school (we have mixed dorms) and my university has a course which is really appealing to me (basically becoming a professional camera operator). 

I LOVE CAMERAS. Perhaps even more than aerospace things or maybe engineering in general. Give me any camera and 10 minutes and I'll figure out how to operate it with minimal effort. When my friends told me (upon my questioning) about the existence of such a course my eyes had lit up. I felt an insane surge of energy since I've always had a keen interest in cinema cameras (and using them my entire life). I've never ever felt such energy and burning passion about something.

I've got my engineering textbooks and have already started reading them to stay ahead of the masses. The thing is that I'd be kidding myself if I said that I'm super passionate about engineering. I'm very confused.

I told my parents about it. They declined. My mother asked me to talk to my father. He declined and asked me to ""not give him headaches."" 

I've been preparing for engineering for the last two years (it's a big deal in my country) and my interest in engineering has been declining.

I am very conflicted. I'm feeling insane rage for my father's inability to even consider what I have to say. He probably likes boasting that his son is studying engineering or whatever (sorry).

I'd like the wise people of the internet to share their opinions on what I should do. For clarity, my university offers both aerospace and film schooling.

Last night I gave this a trial run.  The PSU was powering an unimportant computer, and I used the pcie line as the power to the amp.  Everything powered up, computer boots, dc converter lights up.  However, I forgot to adjust the dc output of the converter.... and the amplifier simply popped, smoke etc.  I would later use my multimeter to find out I was putting 48volts into the amp rated for 35~36 :-(

Having bought a replacement amplifier of amazon, and now tuned the dc converter as low as it will go (36.6v), I am worried about two things:

- Q1 the remaining over-voltage.  Will a 1 volt excess harm the amplifier? It lists 36v using 6ohm speakers, and 34v using 8ohm speakers.  But the capacitor I popped lists 35V on the side.  Can I use a resister to drop the voltage from 36.6v to 34v?  Doesn't the varying amperage load screw that up?  Or maybe the amplifier will be ok with a slight overvoltage?

- Q2 this whole time, I've been assuming [from the TDA7498's datasheet listing 6amps as the overcurrent shutdown threshold](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/db/c5/04/74/fd/08/43/de/CD00244535.pdf/files/CD00244535.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00244535.pdf), that the amp would only ever draw 5A.  Working backward, the dc dc converter outputs 5A max, and draws 15A max.  Am I correct in assuming the PC 12v rail at 25A will easily power the computer and this amp (drawing 15A)?  Am I creating a dangerous situation?  Is the varying amperage draw from music playback going to affect things?

- Q3 is my wiring ok?  I did some research and found 3 parellel 18AWG comes to 13awg combined, which is more than enough to run 15amps across 2' length to the dc converter.  After that, 30+V at 5A can be handled by single pair of 18awg, right?


I will not be running the amp at full power, but I want my build to be safe.  The higher amp nature of everything, and the smoking capacitor on my desk, makes me cautious.  Is there anything about how amperage flows through varying load music amplifiers that I don't understand / account for?

I used ms paint to make it easier to explain what I am trying to achieve.

##Problem  
I live in an arid/desert environment where the dew point is avg 45F, max 65F, and min 35F.  I live in my basement with limited options for cooling the air as I don't have enough windows to make a traditional swamp cooler viable.  In addition I have Multiple sclerosis and become mostly incapacitated when the ambient air gets above 80F so ideally I aiming to keep my living spaces at 70F or lower.

##Current solution &amp; issue   
Currently I have a 10,000 BTU portable air conditioner which is mostly effective but it is cost prohibitive electricity wise while I have access to plenty of water from a 1200 gallon cistern and municipal water.

##Source idea #1 (Coolerado LLC.'s multi-stage indirect evaporative cooler)  
In addition I live somewhat literally down the street from a company called Coolerado which makes commercial scale ""multi-stated indirect evaporative coolers"" which I am trying to mimic in someways.  More in depth information on that is provided by an NREL report here http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/61304.pdf  
I've seen the Coolerado evaporative heat exchanger and I don't know where to begin with trying to replicate that design (page 4) so I figured KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) is the best approach.  

##Source idea #2 (Evaporative ""bong"" cooler)  
Best example of what these look like is here http://www.overclock.net/t/1503843/my-bong-cooler-build-log-evaporative-cooling  Air is forced up a pipe while a mist of water sprayed from the top falls down to a reservoir below with some amount of water converted to a gas, lowering the temperature of the remaining liquid.


##Proposed idea  
Using the image above as a guide (http://imgur.com/ISTXJAL) there would be an working air loop drawn into the basement which would run through the ""bong"" cooling tower and then exhausted outside.  Ideally the water dropped down the cooling tower would be close to local ambient (generally it is ~54-60F).  In tandem, water would be drawn from the reservoir, run through a simple exchange which would hopefully cool the interior air before being sent down the cooling tower.


##Additional ideas, future improvements.  
To make the system a bit more efficient and minimize water losses, the air loop fan would be turned off when the temperature in the reservoir reached some desired temperature (say 65F or even 55F).  

Similarly the interior air exchanger would turn off and on when the ambient interior air temp reached some desired temperature.

A float switch in the reservoir could be used to turn everything off if the reservoir was about to run dry.

Likely part of the first build would be an screen and air filters to keep the reservoir water from being fouled up by dust brought in from outside while a bunch of silver anti-bacterial sticks repurposed from humidifiers would be used to minimize bacterial funk.  That or perhaps just a few milliliters of hydrogen peroxide?

A collector would take water that condensed on the interior air heat exchange and somehow drain that into the reservoir.  I say somehow as I am not sure how well that would work.  If air is being forced into the bottom of the ""bong"" cooling tower, my thought is that it would try to take the path of least resistance by going through the hole meant for condensate to pour into. 

If this works well, a far in the future idea would be to build multiple water/air exchanges in various rooms in my house with insulated PEX pipes running to the reservoir.


##Misc data  
Totally at random I was thinking of using a 6 inch diameter PVC tube for the ""bong"" cooling tower, mostly filled with 40mm ping ball balls, and likely a 1200 gallon per hour flow of water from the reservoir.   

##Mostly random numbers
""Bong"" cooling towers would be 10 inch diameter, 5 feet tall, mostly filled with 40mm ping pong balls to increase surface area.  
Reservoir - currently thinking 30 gallons would be sufficient.  
Intake air exchange CFM - No idea just yet but likely it is around 2,400 CFM
Inside water to air exchange/radiator - No idea, at worse I might just braze together some sort of aluminum abomination radiator and put that on the front of a room box fan.


---

So.... Is this viable?   I have the PVC tubing (rigid &amp; flexible), I have water pumps (claimed 12.5 head with ~1600 GPH flow rates).  From a defunct portable A/C I have a high CFM blower for the intake/exhaust loop.  As for the reservoir itself, sourcing a suitable insulated container shouldn't be too hard (maybe just a large ice chest/cooler).   I was planning on having three cooling towers run in series (with a lot of tinkering to ensure all three get equal amounts of air &amp; water) to compensate for having no idea where to begin with calculating exterior dew point, air intake CFM, water flow rate, and interior air exchange

I'm not sure exactly how to size the hinges, however. They don't need to necessarily hold it open at any position, just keep it from slamming. I don't want to make it take too much effort to open and close (oversized hinges) for example. The types of hinges I'm looking at are like these https://www.mcmaster.com/#1783A2

The weight of the hinged guard is 12.5lb. In the closed position, the center of gravity is 8.04"" away from the hinge in the horizontal axis, and 4.88"" below the hinge in the vertical axis. I've calculated the maximum torque of the box (cg is aligned horizontally with hinge) as SQRT(4.88^2+8.04^2)*12.5lbf = 117.6in-lbf so I know that above that torque rating with hinges, my box will hold any position but I'm afraid that would make it difficult to open (weight of box + hinge resistance).

Is there a proper way to size these so it will make a soft close if dropped? I tried to calculate the maximum potential energy (initial energy to start) and equate that to a final energy comprised of KE of the guard and work done by the hinges, but I'm not sure if that is valid.

I don't view myself as a stereotypical prepper, but more as someone who solves problems seeking solutions. 

I thought of a concept that might save potentially hundreds of thousands of lives, and I'm looking for people who can contribute. In really any capacity. Volunteers who want to do good, I think good people exist still.

Ideas are a dime a dozen. Execution is what matters, and I honestly don't know much about anything in this area. I know enough to know generally what is required technically, but I haven't made sure on paper if this is even practical or not aside from some napkin math.

I also am 100% committed to my current work as a VR developer, so this is more just talking about things with reddit to see how out there this is. I realized that, you know, if an EMP strikes where I live, I and millions of people lose everything and won't be going to work for a while--if we can survive that long. It's had me questioning my decisions. Maybe I should have been working on this RV for a few years instead of fun visual candy.


OK SO..

**If there was an open source, crowd designed and crowd funded vehicle that could conform to this checklist, it could be important to exist:**


1) It must cost under $50K ideally, up to $100K if necessary (everything that isn't labor). Much more puts it as too pricey to be a thing. Should be in the $50-$100 per person range.

2) As many parts as possible should be sourced locally to keep cost down

3) 1 vehicle should be able to provide water and basic energy needs for a micro community of 1000 people

4) Contains electronics for Low power and cost water filtration system with good flow rate. 20GPM looks nice.

5) Contains within it a multi chamber Faraday cage system.

6) Contains within the center of the cage system

7) Contains an EMP hardened generator and solar array (what is the best semi-transparent film/coating that can be applied to a curved window

8) Vehicle needs to be movable

9) Vehicle needs to be huge, sturdy, and fully sealed

10) Stores a few defibrillators (what else should there be? electrically sensitive, space is limited) 

11) Become the hubs for communities to keep the peace. Provide primitive survival education.


**Some notes:**


- I live in Hawaii, so such vehicles would be able to drive to fresh (but not clean) sources of water. Not everywhere has fresh water sources, but I think something that works well in some places is better than nothing.

- I don't know how severely the performance of any solar panel would be impacted by ""good enough"" semi-transparent window shielding

- This is impossible, right? Mind mythbusting this and explaining what would be the most efficient mobile system (if you're cool with making that public)

- I'm a big fan of Open Source, so while there may eventually be investment raised to build these things, that will never change the Open Source-ness. People should be able to, if this is even a thing that can exist, crowdfund what it takes to either build one or buy one.

- I think finding a scalable model could be really cool. It would take 1000 vehicles (add a few more to be safe) to ensure 1M people on the island of Oahu have more hope than they do now of surviving a devastating disaster.

- There is a strange thing going on where everyone I've run this by IRL thinks the government has a plan for this, or ""no one would want to live in a post-emp world anyway, so don't bother"". I'm not particularly satisfied with those thoughts. Unfortunately, it also seems like working on a solution to this is taboo so even if I think it's important I might never speak of it again. Like I'm a crazy person for thinking it's pretty dumb that we don't already have a system in place that would make us laugh about EMP attacks. ""I'm sure smart people are working on it, they have been trying for decades"". They who?

I have a few theories as to how this might be so and I was hoping some more qualified minds might weigh in on them.

1. Peak hp. I'm guessing the 400hp figure is a peak figure, and it would have no hope of producing 400hp continuously as would be necessary in an industrial application. 

2. Final drive ratio. I believe the model s (at least the original one) had almost a 10:1 final reduction. This allows the motor to spin quite fast. I believe that like gas engines, spinning an electric motor faster can result in greater output.

3. Cooling. The motor is liquid cooled which allows for huge current flow for short periods.

I'm having a hell of a lot of trouble with a problem that should be a lot easier to solve. I want to find a way to secure an electrical cable (just about 10mm diam) to a #6 screw hole that will prevent movement  I and provide substantial strain relief.

So far I've been looking at using [nylon cable clamps](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Gardner-Bender-3-8-in-1-Hole-Plastic-Cable-Clamps-15-Pack-PPC-1538/100167050) but they seem to be more suited to routing rather than clamping, and tend to swivel.

I've been working on a trackball design for a while but there's one part I think the vast majority of existing trackballs need improvement on.  The system that allows the ball to move freely within the socket.  It's not that existing trackballs don't do this, it's just that they don't do it as well as I hope they could.  From what I've seen, there are only two options that exist right now -- spherical non-spinning contact points to keep the ball in place (made from steel, synthetic ruby, or some kind of ceramic I believe) and mechanical rollers (like [these](http://www.madox.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/20170616_223526-COLLAGE.jpg) or [this](http://kabinett.homepage.t-online.de/knowldge/stick/pics/tbopen1.jpg)).  Another option although not used in any commercial trackball is [ball transfer units](http://www.statewidebearings.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Mini-units-group-web-image.jpg) (see the one on the far right in the first picture).  These come with the downside of being difficult or impossible to clean when they begin to spin less freely as well as being made for much larger loads (so they aren't as low friction as they could be).  Then there are more theoretical options like levitating the ball on a cushion of air or water like a [kugel fountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugel_fountain), which would be great but there are so many reasons that wouldn't be practical.  Right now I'm considering something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/vGJVwOR.png) where the ball is being pushed up by a magnet into a pair of retaining rollers -- when the user puts their finger on the ball to move it, the ball will be pushed away from the retaining rollers and have little to no contact with the socket (depending on the strength and distance from the magnet(s)).

Question(s):

I was wondering if, from a technical perspective, this is more efficient than a single large rotor.
The way I see it, you'd need a certain amount of force to get off the ground no matter what you use. So that force is constant.

Will 100 small rotors provide the same force as one large rotor with the same input?

There's probably some minimal loss in each rotor because some energy is lost as heat. Then there's also the issue of thrust to weight, I wonder if all these small rotors combined weigh more than 4 large rotors.

Any idea how lift is calculated?

My tap water comes in around 19 °C, and while that won't bring a ton of cooling power, anything is better than sweating at 28+. My ideal case is that at the drain-end, the water would come out only a degree or two below the air temperature. 

I've thought about flowing the tap water through a few meters of ~7mm diameter copper refrigerant tubing and having a fan blow over it, but I'm not sure what length of tubing would ensure near-full heat transfer between air and water. Alternatively, aftermarket radiators for cars seem like they could work, given they are not terribly expensive and have metal fins jointed to the fluid tubes for better heat transfer.

In either case, I'm wondering if there is some way I can estimate the necessary length of tubing (or radiator area) necessary to get fairly good efficiency out of the system. Does anyone know of a way to determine this? Or have some experience with such systems that could be helpful?

Thanks!

EDIT: After digging around for some heat transfer equations, I came across this:

http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/convective-heat-transfer-d_430.html

Given an airspeed of ~10 m/s (rough estimate for a common fan) and a temperature difference of 2°C, I'd need ~75 meters of 6 mm diameter copper tubing to get a measly 100 watts of cooling power. In practice, the ∆T will be larger for most of the tubing, but it seems like this is going to be more difficult than I thought.

First off, I want to start off by asking commenters to be kind and open minded. Please utilize your professionalism/expertise and advise me to the best of your ability.

My background: I had a really rough time in college. Spent my years being psychologically tormented by someone dear to me. I was in an extremely abusive relationship with a major case of psychological manipulation. I was young and dumb. I messed up really badly in college and ended up graduating with a niche major (B.S in anthro). My graduation GPA is below 3.0. Barely scraping by, I know. My early 20's was a train wreck. I was hopeless and deflated. I felt worthless and dumb. What to do with my BS in Anthro? 

Fast forward a couple months after my graduation, I found a job as a bid coordinator for a construction company that deals with engineering and public works project. This job gave me the introduction that I believe I needed. I got to meet various resident engineers throughout my period of employment. A handful of them offered to help me get into engineering. This was a glimpse of hope I had not seen in years. Admittedly it has not been more than 3 months since I started working. However, this job had delivered the self confidence that I had not felt in what feels like an eternity.

I now have people trying to help me get into civil engineering by advising me on how to put one foot in the door through such things as the EIT and taking autocad/microstation courses. However, with my current educational standing, I do not feel like I can simply study to pass the EIT. I am honestly having a quarter life crisis (lol) and am seriously considering applying to local colleges for a secondary bachelors in civil engineering.

What I am considering: I messed up big time during my few years of college. I have racked up major student loan debts. I have terrible GPA and risk being rejected by schools even if I do decide on applying. I know I did poorly in my prior years of psychological fragility, but I swear I have become a much stronger individual now more than ever. 

What are your opinions on this? 

TLDR: I f-ed up through my first BS in Anthropology. I want to try for a second bachelor for Civil Engineering. Should I or should I not?

Basically this machine feeds through 1.25"" OD x .125 wall mild steel pipe
**1.)** At the end of the pipe it presses the last 4"" flat (Requires 35 tons)
**2.)** then punches a .625"" hole in the flat part and trims the corner (hole and corner treatment single punch/die) (Requires 18 tons)
[Picture of Prototypes](http://imgur.com/ZqHIXML)
The die I've designed is double acting so the ram will need to 
1.) travel to max stroke
2.) return 1"" back
3.) travel to max stroke
4.) return full

I made the prototypes on a air/hydraulic 50ton [Link to Press](http://www.northerntool.com/shop/tools/product_200641790_200641790) here is a crappy [[GIF](http://imgur.com/48HOMH0)](http://imgur.com/MBUe0GN) and [picture](http://imgur.com/Bbze63S) of my prototype jig (scrap materials within arms reach).  The only issue I had with this press was the ram speed was ~1inch/min and I need to increase that considerably. **(Is there a way to increase the speed of these air/hydraulics with a new air valve/regulator or something?)**

Right now my design uses a 50ton double acting hydraulic ram [Enerpac 50 ton Ram](https://www.grainger.com/product/ENERPAC-50-tons-Double-Acting-High-23NP99?functionCode=P2IDP2PCP) but the cost + [hydraulic pump](https://www.grainger.com/product/ENERPAC-High-Force-Hydraulic-Electric-6BU67?s_pp=false&amp;picUrl=//static.grainger.com/rp/s/is/image/Grainger/6BU67_AS01?$smthumb$)
Is around ~$10k.  (Anyone have cheaper alternatives I could use?)

I'm wondering if I could achieve the tonnage I need with a camshaft **/** electric motor **/** gearbox setup.  I see them used for high frequency stamping with a flywheel but this press would only be used every few minutes when the machine is running so I don't know if it can be achieved without the momentum.

**tl;dr
Trying to create a 50 ton press with an irregular stroke
Can it be done by upgrading cheap air/hydraulic press
Where can I find cheaper hydraulics if I go this route?
Can it be done with a mechanical cam/electric motor and gearbox configuration**

**EDIT:
Also should I be using a hydraulic cylinder with some sort of geared/mechanical advantage setup between the ram?**

Disclaimer: I'm as far from an engineer as you can get. An ELI5 explanation would be great! 

I'm currently writing a fiction work set about a hundred years in the future after an extinction-level event almost wiped out all life on earth. I'm thinking something like a nuclear war or supervolcano. 

A ""colony"" of sorts has formed and uses an old nuclear reactor for power. For sake of the story, this reactor was built sometime in the 1970's. One of the key plot points I have going is that this reactor needs to start breaking down or malfunctioning to an extent where it would present an immediate danger to those living in this settlement, and they would have to leave or face almost certain death.

Also bear in mind that the people running this reactor have almost no extensive technical knowledge about how to maintain it, as many of the records, manuals, etc were lost to time. They're going off of only the most basic knowledge available.

So, how could I spin this to make it at least somewhat realistic that everyone needs to GTFO before the reactor melts down/kills everyone?

I am adding mounting points to an OEM car roof rack ( [Honda HRV with rails/crossbars](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31lfGAA8E5L._SX355_.jpg) ) so that I can use ratcheting straps to secure a non-OEM car top carrier. To do this, I am adding a steel U-bolt to each side of each crossbar, 4 total, and securing them with a U-bolt-plate above and below the crossbar (8 total). The threaded section of the bolt points down, and the rounded portion accepts the S-hooks from the straps.

The crossbars are 2.5"" wide so I am limited to using U-bolts with inner width &gt;2.5"", the only reasonable ones I found were 3/8""(thick) x 3""(W) x 4.5""(L). Although these are perfect width wise, they are a bit big vertically, in that if the top plate is limited by the curved section, the threads end before the bottom plate can squeeze the crossbar. My options are to use spacers above the lower bolt, to raise the top plate above the end of the threads (current plan is to use over-sized nuts or nylon spacers), or:

**limit the top plate of the U-bolt by threading a nut to the runout, making a: shank/nut/plate/crossbar/plate/nut/thread sandwich** [(orange circle in the image)](http://imgur.com/a/GjjNC)

In execution, this solution is better for a few reasons, as long as it won't catastrophically fail on the highway ;). I believe, since the tension load from the straps will be primarily upward, this top nut is not support much load, just the clamping force on the crossbar, and the bottom plate is holding most of the tension from the straps.

I'm not sure this is the correct sub for this.  Sorry if that is the case.  

Some context:

I'm an Air Force veteran with a background in PMEL (Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory).  It's calibration of electronics.  I specialized in RF/Microwave measurements and ended up needing to reference schematics and do some low level circuit design for test fixtures.  

About a year ago I was hired at a small company to do the same thing.  This time, I ended up needing to develop calibration procedures for our use (usually based on methods already used in the industry).  

About 3 months ago they offered me an open-ended promotion with a small raise and moved me to production/manufacturing.  They told me to ""make up a job title"" which I was not comfortable doing and ended up with the title of production quality control.  

Fast forward to now.  I'm needing to come up with ESD/EMI infrastructure, write all of our manufacturing and test procedures, do QA all on multiple product lines.  

Question:

When I search my job description (s) all of the related duties fall under engineering level jobs.  Now, I don't have an engineering degree so I understand why I wouldn't be called an engineer nor be paid like one.  The problem is, I'm not anywhere close to where I should be paid (in my humble opinion).  I'm talking ~25-30k short of what an engineer is paid to do what I'm doing according to ASQ and sites like Glassdoor.  Is this standard?  If not how do I approach my boss about this?  I agreed to the original raise obviously, but I didn't know what I would be doing.

Im am attempting to scale up a cold brew coffee machine to be able to produce larger amount of coffee that the small commercially available cold drip rigs.

For those that don't know what cold drip coffee is, its cold water dripped over a 8-12 hour timeframe that extracts a smoother tasting black coffee that has a similar caffeine content to espresso.

One of the benefits of cold drip is the column aspect which act in a similar way to chromatography columns whereby the heavier molecules take longer to pass through than the smaller molecules thus extracting with a unique flavour profile.

Example below.
Example of cold drip - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8pNmYrAYZI
Small scale that we are using - http://clean-machine.com.au/Yama-25-Cup-124oz-Cold-Drip-Coffee-Maker-Brown-Wood-Frame.html

In my experiments so far I crudely attempted to scale to a 20L tall keg (below) with the top cut off and a 3/4"" fitting on the bottom. 
http://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/NNMAAOSwfcVUKVgY/s-l300.jpg

The 20l keg held about 6kg of ground coffee which would in theory make around 51L of coffee (59L input with 8 held in coffee) with the ratio/flavour profile we like on the smaller machines

I used a peristaltic pump to deliver the water at the required drip rate to deliver uniformly 59L over 10 hours.

I found within the first hour that the water was not passing through at a fast enough rate and that I had to stop it multiple time to let the water pass. After a couple of hours I stop completely as it seemed like it was failing. Some liquid passed through but upon throwing out the contense of the keg it showed that the water had found the path of least resistance and flowed past most of the dry coffee (what we call channeling)

Sorry for the long back story but I felt it necessary for my question

The questions if have are:

1) It appeared to me that the pressure or weight of the water (or the gas trying to go up) was preventing the water to pass / or compacting the coffee to make the flow rate slower. Is their a any knowledge here about how substances take on moisture, and what Surface Area / volume ratios are best suited for stead absorption. Maybe some water irrigation science could be applied here.

2) Are there any formulas I can apply to scaling up from the small scale test that will aid me scaling up. Ie. how does SA:V ratio effect the flow rates and channeling

3) Are there any procedures that I can use to stop the coffee from finding the path of least resistance. Maybe moisten the coffee before hand? Im not sure.

Thanks

two question i have.

first, this fan can't to be installed in the basement so if it leaks i'm not drawing radon into the basement, and the attic area isn't large enough, since the 3"" pipe runs up the exterior wall and out the roof, i dont have any room to cut into it. so im going to reroute the pipe outside at ground level. My question is, do i need to run the stack up to the roof of can vent at ground level. im assuming code will require me to run it up to the roof, i'd just like to know why, i'm guess its to get the gas away so it disperses in the air better, sort of like plumping vent pipes.

second, there are two images i see, one where the fan is directly in line and another where its offset, what is the purpose of the offset? I had assumed it was for a cleanout, but there is a flexible tube that bypasses the fan.

For my internship the Big boss asked me to determine the accuracy of the ""Concentrated Source Method"".
This  ""Method II.2"" described in the HMRI manual (comparable to ISO-Norms) which is used to determine the immission relevant source power in a certain direction from (a) sound source(s) during a well defined business situation.

They distinguish two situations I don't fully understand.
- Measurepoint on a whole sphere
High round sources positioned on an imaginary plane of measurement in the form of a whole sphere where its center alignes with the source center.
1,5 d &lt; R , 0,5 h_b
where h_b = hight of the source above the ground.

- Measurepoint on a halve sphere
If a concentrated source is located near a horizontal surface, the plane of measurement is chosen as a half sphere around the source. The center of the half sphere alignes with the projectile of the source center on the horizontal surface. examples are. paved and grassy grounds and rooftops etc. 
R &gt; 1,5d

The difference is still a bit vague to me, it was once explained but i kind of forgot. I do know that it kind of felt counter intuitive at the time.

Anyhow.
The purpose is to calculate the sourcepower L_wr
from the measurements we can get a average soundpressurelevel L_Aeq,T

condition. R &lt; 20m:
Whole sphere: L_wr = L_Aeq,T + 10 log (4pi R^2)
Half sphere: L_wr = L_Aeq,T + 10 log ( 4pi R^2 - 2)

condition R &gt; 20m
L_wr = L_Aeq,T + 10 log (4pi R^2 + a_air R)
L_wr = L_Aeq,T - L_fiction.
a_air = airabsorptioncoeff.

MAIN QUESTION:
Can somebody help me figure out how to determine the margin of error of the sourcepower.
How do i determine the margin of error in each individual factor
How to reduce the error as good as possible?

ANY INFORMATION WILL HELP

So I have long wanted to build a desk with a compartment that raises up and hides the monitor and has some other storage. Sort of a larger version of [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ea/fa/bb/eafabb3f50fa964606b2c68f89b7143c.jpg). But i dont want to buy something pre-existing. I want to lean how to build it myself. 

I work with wood primarily, so that side of things is sorted. The issue I am having is with designing the part that actually moves the cabinet with the monitor in it. Based on some googling I was thinking having 2 linear rails, one on each side that guides the motion up and down, with a motorized screw in the middle that actually lifts the cabinet. I can program, so i was hoping to find motors that were arduino friendly, so that i can use that platform's ecosystem of sensors and inputs to control the up/down motion. I just need some help getting started and moving in the right direction. I would hate to order parts for this and have them all be too small/overkill/wrong. 

**Assumptions:**

 The cabinet will be around 80 pounds between monitor, stored things like headphones and keyboard, and the wood itself.  

I will use some sensor determine when to stop moving. 
  
**The big things im worried about**: 

 How do i prevent the load from making the screw spin backwards and slowly sink down, but then still be able to reverse the motor and have it go back down when i need it to? could i solve this with a worm drive gear box?

Is having the central screw as the primary load bearing support dangerous? 

Where would I source gears, a threaded rod, motors and all the hard ware from?

what kind of motor do I need for this? How would i calculate the the strength of is a stepper motor overkill?


Im sure will have lots of other questions, thank you all in advance!

I do get to work with/run/tinker/maintain large production machines which I actually like doing.


Is it worth my time to retrain for 3 years to get to a technician level position? It would be in Engineering Support and Mechatronics, below degree level of course, starting where maybe a 17yr old might!


I would be on a low salary for that time, but the 3 years involves the first year in school, the next two in placement and I would be hired by the government sector, so good chance of employability, but probably a clause saying I have to work x (3yrs?) amount of years there due to them funding my study.


I'm wondering if there is a low ceiling in terms of salary, technicians seem to earn around £22-24k ($26-30k) in England.


I'm most likely going to be with people below 20yrs old, I also jave to think about that.



***I'd also be interested in knowing if I can work in other countries, or does this type of work tend to have country specific qualifications?

After many days of wracking my brain/the internet for why these things only had 2 leads (wheres the third pin to plug into my arduino???) I think I've come up with a breakthrough. Since these are ""galvanic"" electrochemical sensors, they PRODUCE their own electricity. ITS A PLUG AND PLAY, BATTERIES INCLUDED SENSOR!!!!!

Final answer.

Soooo am I right? or wrong?



Edit* So when I wire this sensor up, would it just be: 

(sensor ground)---(Arduino ground) 

and 

(sensor vcc)----(Arduino A0)

It's rather powerful, and should discriminate targets with 1 m22 RCS in ranges up to 200 km. Okay, let's build its range-speed image (about ±±750 m/s in speed dimension, about 1500 m in range).

But there is a problem: when there are some targets nearby (about 10 km) they give not just a peak that can exceed the discrimination threshold, but a cross-like figure (sidelobes in range dimension, end, especially, sidelobes in speed dimension). And if the target is close enough, freaky sidelobes still can exceed the threshold and be treated as target candidates.

I don't think I will find anything further just by googling around.  Any informed responses are welcome as it seems doubtful there will ever be objectively verifiable answer.

Many are familiar with the very thorough NIST report which addresses the events leading up to the initiation of the progressive collapse(s).  I have continued to wonder about the actual dynamics of the collapse progression itself.  I don't have an engineering background.  I have read Bazant's analyses which assume that the top sections of the towers remained essentially rigid, progressively down-crushing the lower sections with minimal upward propagation of the crush zone until the collapse reaches the ground.  I imagine some assumptions are being made here about whether the top section could feasibly withstand deformation to the extent that it can be treated as a rigid object until the final stages of the collapse progression.  Bone fragments continue to be recovered from rooftops of high-rise buildings in the vicinity of the towers, ostensibly from laterally projections of the collapsing tower.  This suggests that a great deal of material occupying the upper floors was already obliterated when the collapse front was still at a relatively high altitude, particularly in the top sections where human bodies were concentrated.  

Like many Americans, I have always been a little horrified at the fact that so many bodies, like the desks, chairs, etc., where apparently reduced to dust.  Firefighters who survived in the 4th floor stairwell of the north tower described how the floor seemed to bounce as the oncoming collapse smashed down story after story coming down at them.  To me, this suggests that the building frame was reflecting resistive forces upwards at the collapsing mass even though these forces countered only a very small fraction of the downward kinetic energy.  Put another way, it makes sense to me that objects being serially impacted against 80+ concrete floors by a falling 50000-ton top section would result in nearly-complete disintegration of furnishings and human remains.  Still, I wonder about whether the people in the top section were crushed in this way progressively over the course of the collapse, or whether the top floors would have remained largely intact and only pulverized upon hitting the ground.  I would like to think there was minimum pain/horror for those victims but I just want as close to a realistic understanding as I can.

TL;DR - Would the top sections have disintegrated early in the collapse (due to up-crush or deformation), allowing everything inside to be pulverized at an early stage, OR would the sections have remained rigid and perhaps somewhat preserved until being pulverized upon hitting the ground (on top of the rubble)?

I've seen on numerous sites on the Internet that the Force needed to cut these sheets essentially simplify themselves to: ""F = A x T max"", and quoting from the website I took it:

&gt;L = Length of periphery to be cut in ‘mm’.

&gt;S = Sheet thickness in ‘mm’

&gt;T max = Shear strength in N/mm2

But the thing is that you don't need to be really smart to realize that this equation assumes you're cutting the whole thing at once (sectional area being L times S) which would take an ENORMOUS amount of energy and force. In reality what happens is that the cut happens on a very small sectional area (I'd argue a point of contact, even) which results in a much lower amount of force required, there's a reason why most guillotine blades are either diagonal or their cut is diagonal after all, a diagonal cut is much more efficient than a completely straight cut.

Problem is, I'm trying to automatize this process attaching a Pneumatic Cylinder to the cutter (roughly speaking) but I need the force required as a reference to pick the Cylinder properties, such as the diameter. However, how can I mathematically represent the maximum cutting force needed? I'd appreciate literally any advice you guys could give me, thanks in advance.

I have a vibration specification that gives breakpoint frequencies (Hz) and power spectral densities (g^2/Hz).

I was sent vibration data in the form of m/s^2 @ various frequencies.

Some google later...

According to this: http://www.vibrationresearch.com/university/random-rms-calculator/
I calculated the ""area"" (to use that site's term) of each frequency range, which should give me an answer in units of g^2.  (Taking the square root of the sums of the results should give me the RMSg, which agrees with what is stated in the specification, so I'm pretty confident in this step.)

Then I take the square root of the g^2 in each frequency range (gives me g for that frequency range) and multiply by 9.81 to give me m/s^2 for that frequency range.

I interpret this as the acceleration allowed in each frequency range.

Then I took my X-Y-Z data and found the combined vector.

Am I now able to compare my data (combined vector) with the allowed acceleration in each frequency range?

e.g. at 50 Hz, the combined vector is 10 m/s^2.  According to my spec, at 50 Hz, all my number crunching gives me 15 m/s^2.

Current situation: We have one day shift process engineer (7-4), one swing shift process engineer (3-12) and one weekend day shift process engineer that works Thur-Sun on 4 10's.  Whenever a long weekend comes up or the weekend engineer takes vacation someone has to provide engineering support.  The engineering manager also provides coverage some times.

We currently get the following: 

* We get a 5% annual salary premium for being on call.
* If we are on call (need to be able to show up at the plant within 1.5 hours) we get nothing.  If we don't get called in we do not get additional PTO.  
* If we get called in while on call we get 1/2 day PTO if under 4 hours or 1 day PTO if more than 4 hours.  
* On holidays we get double. 

Some suggestions for improving our coverage rotation were the following:
* Instead of being on call, just come in for the 2-4 days and then get those days as PTO.
* When you are on call you get a 1/2 of PTO regardless, even if you did not get called in.

My current approach has been to solve for the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity and use those values to calculate the combined initial velocity.

Measurements (not final, will be retaken to account for uncertainty):
vertical distance of water arc (dy) = 0.093m,
horizontal distance of water arc (dₓ) = 0.212m,
acceleration of gravity = -9.8m/s²,
time = 0.3875 seconds,

Calculations:

Horizontal Component:
dₓ = Vₓt ,
Vₓ = 0.212m/0.3875s ,
Vₓ = 0.547096m/s (extra digits carried) ,

Vertical Component:
Δd = Vyt + 1/2at² ,
0m = (0.3875s)Vy + (-9.8m/s^2)(0.3875s)² ,
(0.3875s)Vy = -0.735765625m ,
Vy = 1.89875m/s (extra digits carried) ,

Pythagorean theorem for the combined initial velocity:
Vᵢ = √(Vₓ²+Vy²) ,
Vᵢ = √((0.547096m/s)²+(1.89875m/s)²) ,

**Basically, is it feasible to modify older petrol engines for lower emissions?**

The reason I'm asking is that there are a lot of older vehicles around which are physically sound, and often built to a higher standard of durability than newer ones. For your daily driver it's obvously best to stick to new tech for reasons like road safety and low emissins, but for some use cases like pulling trailers, transporting goods short distances, road assist during swedish winters and such it is often not worth putting down the money for a new, less sturdy vehicle. 

I've looked around a bit and all i've found are discussions on how to increase performance, cheat emissions tests, or increase MPG. 

Take the GMC L35 engine- used in a wide array of vechicles, insane amount of spare parts and know-how available for it.
Would it be feasible to modify this engine in such a way as to significantly reduce emissions and allow one to use it as a workhorse with slightly less bruised conscience? Decreasing fuel consumption is important as well, but I think in some cases (mine for example) it would be better overall to be able to use a cheap car like this on the few occasion I need to drive my bike to the track for example and drive an efficient compact hybrid the rest of the time.. Instead I find myself needing to buy a larger, heavier allround vehicle and use that all year round, which i think has a bigger negative impact in the long run, as well as perpetuating the attitude that everybody needs a fully capable car. 

If anyone has any related papers or links or whatnot I'd gladly consume them. 
In Sweden taxes are high for cars with high emissions, and fuel is very expensive. Vehicles built for heavier duty are much more rare than in the us and cost a fair bit. Meanwhile a used &lt;2000 Chevy S-10 with a vortec V6 that with proper maintenance might last forever goes for less than you'd pay for a new set of winter tires on aluminum rims.

I recently saw a really cool video of a girl using a bar with 4 electric thrusters attached. In all its simplicity, it generated thrust, which propelled her while wearing skis. They apparently had plans to manufacture and sell it, but for a pretty prohibitive price of like $10 000, which is a bit ridiculous for a recreational toy.

I've given it some thought and want to crunch some numbers to see how feasible it'd be to build one for myself. Primary motivation is to do it cheaper. More than $1000 isn't likely to happen.

First of fall: **How do I estimate required thrust?** Price increases fast with increasing thrust, so I don't want more than necessary to provide a decent amount of fun. IIRC the product I mentioned has about 50 kgf. They reached speeds of 50-60 mph with this, and while it sounds like a lot of fun, it seems grossly overpowered and obviously expensive. It's just a novently

My requirements are basically: I want to be able to **climb an incline of say 20% at a pace of at least 4 m/s, on cross country skis**. This should be enough of a specification to calculate required thrust, but I'm not sure how. Is the required thrust basically equal to my weight multipled by the incline plus drag from the skis? How to guesstimate ski-drag? Air resistance seems insignificant in this context, since top speed is probably gonna be plenty anyway. **10 m/s top speed** seems like an okay goal, secondary to the climbing speed.

Then: **Knowing the required thrust, how do I estimate the required motor power?** I realize this depends on a lot of things like propellers etc, but I'm not talking precision calculations here. +-25% is good enough for a result just to pick a motor.

**Having a motor with a given rpm and power, how do I choose the best propeller?** I suppose constraints need to be applied, like maximum size, since bigger is almost always better in my understanding, but after applying a maximum size constraint, how do I choose the best propeller? There are plenty of R/C airplane prop calculators, but they do little to help with the choosing process, and finding a prop with this method seems to boil down to choosing from hundreds of propeller products and just trial and erroring your way to a decent one, and it doesn't seem very efficient...

And finally **Is there an obvious winner between gasoline, nitro and electric BLDC motors when it comes to cost for this application?** I'm inclined to believe that a couple of small hobby gasoline motors, say 20-30 cc would do this cheaper than an electric equivalent, but without all the data(which I can't yet work out) above it's hard to make a fair comparison. It seems like electric motors lose big time because of batteries not being nearly as economic as a tank of gasoline, but that's just my hunch. Plus, you can have basically unlimited range with gasoline. Maybe a nitro motor is a good candidate too? On the other hand, an electric motors relatively quiet operation is a big plus, and I'd rather not stink of exhaust when using it. Plus, electric motors come in handy EDF-modules, which are compact, easy to use and offer some degree of protection thanks to the cowl.

Hope someone can help me in the right direction with any of these steps. Thanks!

Firstly, I'm aware of the relationship of:

P = (T*N*2pi)/60 

Therefore it's clear to see that torque is inversely proportional to crank RPM. I'm also aware that in this context, the torque is the force of the piston multiplied by distance of the centre point of the big end journal to the main bearing journal centre point and that power just the rate of work done on/by the pistons, therefore without that formula earlier, common sense would dictate power will increase with RPM; more crank rotations per minute, more explosions and power strokes etc etc.

I'm also aware of the volumetric efficiency of an engine, and that peak torque is produced when volumetric efficiency is at it's highest across the rev range because obviously, with a better volumetric efficiency, a more powerful combustion can be produced, therefore exerting a higher force on the piston during the power stroke. Then, past that, as the RPM increases, volumetric efficiency decreases due to the valve train becoming less efficient not allowing the engine to 'breathe and exhale' properly, thus causing the torque to decrease. 

Now on to my main question really and sorry if I dont do a good job explaining this. If under full throttle (and ignoring gear ratios and transmission), the torque decreases past peak volumetric efficiency, what is causing the RPM to increase which enables the power to increase? Or if you like, how does an engine still able to cause a car to accelerate and we feel this sensation as 'performance' as the RPM and power increases if the engine's torque is decreasing as an engine goes through the RPM range and therefore reducing in torque and 'force' of the engine to pull the car.

Is it to do with inertia of the flywheel that is able to keep the crank rotating which is obviously then connected to the valve-train via belts/chains and then it's almost like a snowball effect where RPM just keeps building up and as a product of this, the increased rate of work just takes over and compensates for the weaker force of each explosion on the piston by just having more of them per unit of time,and as a driver we experience this as an increase in performance?

Another way to look at it I guess is using F1 (a subject im massively interested in both as a sport and engineering/career wise) and the days of the 3.0l NA V10's in the early 00's that could rev up to 20,000.

I know those engines had low torque outputs, but they were still able to seriously huck a car down a track with vast acceleration. Were engineers forced to produced engines that revved that high just to counter act the low torque outputs of those engines and almost have to go with quantity over quality in terms of combustion and getting the piston to do work?",,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,,,self,"Getting to grips with the relationship between power, rpm and torque (mainly SI engines).",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/5dd1f6/getting_to_grips_with_the_relationship_between/,,,,,,,,1479349821.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,1445823425.0,{},{},

This centrifuge system has a number of small stepper motors to put in the reagents into the centrifuge chamber. From what I read online, the main failure modes of a stepper motor is bearing failure due to wear and tear. And if you know FMEA, you know that there are three grades per failure mode - Severity of the Failure (S), Probability of Occurrence (O) and the Detection Rate (D) and RPN= SxOxD. My question is about the O value - what should it be? Because if I put O = 10 (almost absolute certainty) then the RPN paints a pretty skewed picture IMO. As S = 10 (motor stops working), O = 10 and D = 2 or 3 (based on detector used), which gives a very high RPN of 200 or 300 - which probably means that this item should be dealt with.

I need help designing the ideal layout of a horizontal abrasive wheel machine used to reprofile and thin bladed objects, mainly kitchen knives. By horizontal, I mean that the wheel is rotating on a horizontal plane as opposed to a vertical one. Yes, I know there are some machines out there that fit the bill, such as the [makita](https://www.amazon.com/Makita-9820-2-Horizontal-Wheel-Sharpener/dp/B0000223JC) and others ( including the typical vertical [tormek](https://www.amazon.com/Tormek-T-7-Cooled-Precision-Sharpening/dp/B0026LVYYC/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479008300&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tormek+t7) )

I do not want to use any of these. Please do not suggest a prefabricated machine. After hours of conversations in the cutlery online world, horizontal centerless designs are the way to go. They are all custom built (by a subcontractor or by the honemeister themselves), and are a trade secret. I cannot find any designs anywhere (if you can, that's awesome - I'd love to see them). 

Horizontal because it largely eliminates convex grinds that a vertical wheel like the tormek would shape into the blade, and centerless because of the precision a small surface area creates, as well as eliminating dishing that eventually occurs when the entirety of the surface area of a full wheel is not used over time.
I also know that there are horizontal abrasive wheels out there (can't find them online right now - too tired). I do not want to use any of those either! My shop is all about using natural stones (mainly). I have access to a wheel-shaped Japanese stone (I will be using mainly Japanese whetstones) that I will be using. The wheel can be found [here](http://current.aranyik.com/2016/04/building-330-mm-amakusa-wheelstone.html) as well as a similar build by a friend of mine. But the tolerances are too low, the rpm too low, and it's not centerless. But it's a start. It might weigh a 100 pounds or so. It doesn't come centerless, but carving it out won't be much of an issue.

That being said, I am trying to emulate the wheel used in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aytbv06h7B8)

Rudimentary water system and splash guard. I have access to a wheel as mentioned. But I don't know how to put together a motor, preferably with variable speed, and the wheel. Like how do I connect them? I also need to be careful about the water (although there won't be THAT much).

The best lead on a motor with variable speed is using a treadmill motor, which the basics can be viewed in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ6i-CWvgXk)

These are often used for DIY projects such as this, often for ceramic wheel hacks. Anyways, I need it to be precise as to create a even plane of abrasion, so whatever I have connecting the motor and the wheel, needs to be sturdy and well machined. Can a motor be vertically integrated and bear the weight of the wheel? Or should it be set off to the side to avoid such weight, as well as be away from any possible water leakage? I've read somethings thing about direct drive motors. Any input on them? Do I need a gearbox to adjust the speed, or does the treadmill motor and wiring work well enough? I'm able with my hands, but have limited knowledge in electrical and serious mechanical work.

Budget would ideally be under $1k, but the less the better. I appreciate any help you can give. I'd love to crack open this closed secret with your assistance.

I'm going to try to keep this brief, so I won't go into too much detail.

**Question first**: ""What do you call a torque on a motor perpendicular to the drive shaft, and how do I know whether or not I need to account for it?""

**Context:** I'm not an engineer.  I'm intentionally outside my comfort zone here. For a personal project I'm trying to design a robot that will be primarily 3d printed.  I'm currently interested in the drive system/suspension/chassis.  I've decided to use a rocker-bogie suspension like NASA's Mars rovers (mostly because I think it's cool instead of any other criteria).  After considering the bounds of my design and using a drive motor sizing calculator, I've selected this gear motor (**https://www.pololu.com/product/2824**) to power each of my wheels. (I feel like I could probably pick a cheaper motor, but that's not actually part of this question.)  I would like to mount my wheels directly onto the shaft of that gear motor to keep the design simple.  I suspect that the motor is not designed to be loaded in this way though, and that the radial force of the wheel on the motor will damage the motor.  I think I could mount the wheel to a shaft that's secured with bearings and then couple that shaft to the motor to transfer power, but that's a lot more complexity that I'd like to avoid if I can get away with it.

**How do I know how much radial force the motor can take (while operating)?**  In a worst case scenario I expect 20N radial force at about 30mm from the end of the gearbox.

This is what I want to duplicate, but I have some complications:  I'm using SMT components (although if necessary I could probably used leaded).  I have a 3w bi-color cree type ""bat wing"" LED (it has 4 legs).  (also, is there a better more standardized term to describe [this](http://image2.buyincoins.com/bicv2/product/s0/3w-led-lamp-beads-pure-white.jpg) form factor?  It seems quite popular).  [Here is a simple illustration I made](http://i.imgur.com/hZgD1tC.jpg) to show the Coast G20 layout.  
Finally, while all the above are standalone questions, the particular LED I'm working with right now is rather fancy (besides the bi-colorness)  it has a soft silicone lens and I feel like I might get better results using a [TIR reflector](http://www.optic-fov.com/en/news/211.html) rather than conventional or flat/convex.  It seems to me that that would capture and reflect more of the otherwise lost light.  I wonder how much efficiency we're losing in the coast example.  The fact that TIR's typically reach down and surround the dome seems particularly effective at capturing that stray light and surrounding the diode element.  Yes?
This might be even better when using a silicone lens as it would perfectly conform.   At least that's my thinking.

Oh, and since it's got two chips side by side, I think it's going to be harder to get a blended and uniform spot since light will be coming from one side or the other even though the lens is surrounded (at least in the TIR example).  I wonder if native TIR design also might help with that.

You would attach a payload with a quick release onto a long tether (tens if not hundreds km long) with a large parachute in the middle and a winch at a ground station.

Deploy the parachute in the upper atmosphere one way or another, fire up that winch and suddenly you have your payload on it's way into space without all that rocket fuel.

The tether/chute could be made out of Dyneema and the tether could be hoisted up by drones along the way to fight gravity if need be.

Am I nuts for thinking this could work?

Edit - 

My back of the envelope calculations seemed to indicate that the parachute won't have a problem generating 'lift' since the air surrounding it is more or less static relative to a chute if the winch can put enough energy into the payload fast enough. The weak point would be the tether which would snap if pulled too fast.

I come to you seeking assistance on a project I have determined to take on, a project that will let the everyday man defecate like royalty. I aim to reproduce as many of the features of the infamous TOTO Neorest® 750H with Actilight™. Some of these features include an air purification system, an antibacterial UV light, automatic toilet cover raising/closing, automatic flushing, heated seats, and a toilet pre""mister"". So far arrived at several solutions for some of these features, by utilizing an IoT relay switch ($16.87) I can control several appliances whose functions would be needed via an internet enabled Raspberry Pi ($35.99). Some of the appliances I have determined are optimal for functionality and cost are a HEPA/UV air filter/purifier ($52.94) to sanitize and freshen the air post-flush, a 3 Watt germicidal light bulb ($8.99) to sanitize when the lid is closed, a force sensing resistor ($14.95) to sense when you are seated, an analog pH sensor designed for Arduino ($81.66) to analyze fluids for health tracking, and an infrared proximity switch ($7.99) to sense when you approach the toilet. Any information related to any potential ideas and/or execution of potential features along with alternative components would be greatly appreciated! Together Reddit Engineers, we can change the way the everyday man defecates forever! One small step for the excrement of mine, one giant leap for the excrement of mankind!

Note: If anyone ends up building something similar or relevant let me know! I'd love to discuss some specifications. This post will be updated as I expand and refine this project. Once I build it I will try to get a video guide to build your own uploaded, along with pictures of the final product.

P.S. For the most recent update on the component list, go to: http://smile.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/18DLG39CO62UD . There you can see my Amazon shopping list for the project!

Update I: It turns out that the IoT Relay Switch I found only operates off of one bit, and as such will only allow for control of appliances that are operating simultaneously. As result, the options are as such: it is either necessary to purchase several of these, which would not be cost effective; the better option being that an alternative relay must be found, that can allow for individual control over appliances.

Update II: From further analysis of this design schema, the number of components, and wires that will be required to operate this toilet could be considered an eyesore, which gave me the idea to house all of these components inside a desktop case. Allowing for good airflow to the electronics, and hiding the components in a stylish housing, all while keeping them accessible enough to be easily worked on/troubleshooted.

Update III: Due to sanitary concerns I determined that the PC case would pose more problems than solutions, as such that has been scrapped, and I am working on coming up with an alternative solution to house the electronics. I am intrigued by the idea of converting the toilet to a tankless flush and using the tank to house the electronics, however this would involve some plumbing work which I am not very familiar with.

## Reports: how YOU can make AskEngineers way better!

Before I talk about anything else, I briefly want to mention the **report** function.

**Right now, almost nobody submits reports.** This is bad because it lets a lot of low-quality posts slip past the moderator queue (which we look at on a daily basis). I encourage everyone to start using reports — if you've judged that a post or comment doesn't belong in AskEngineers, report it. We'll evaluate them case-by-case.

**Note:** reports are not ""super downvotes"", so don't use them that way.

[**Here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/about/rules) are all the reasons you can report a post or comment, which are conveniently the same as the guidelines in the sidebar. If a post doesn't break one of these rules, consider whether your judgment is correct or not; we're always available by [mod mail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskEngineers&amp;subject=Report) if you aren't sure.

### Lessons learned

The work experience threads were first started 2 years ago by nosjojo, and came out of the need to make the FAQ page able to answer common questions from the inevitable waves of engineering students and freshly graduated engineers every season; it's our [eternal September](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/September-that-never-ended.html) and something we have to deal with on a regular basis whether we like it or not.

When I decided to run the posts again, I organized them a little differently and shilled the post in other subreddits to gather outside interest. This worked well, but there were problems which became apparent after the first few. Originally each thread was supposed to last 2 weeks or if 20 responses were gathered (whichever came first), and the next thread would be posted. As I continued, I found that I would either forget to post them, or didn't have time to. This didn't end up being a huge deal, but it was a pain for the mods to keep on top of.

After this experience, we've pinned down how to make these threads consistently more organized simply by adding them to Automoderator's schedule. Moving forward, because reddit archives posts 6 months after posting, there will be several yearly posts on rotation:

Thread|Frequency
:--|:--:
Work experience threads|once per year
Engineers available for interview|once per year
Panel of Engineers (flair application)|twice per year

### Career threads

Some users have expressed that they really dislike seeing career-related questions on AskEngineers. Career questions have always been allowed, with a mixture of quality ranging from fantastic ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4fa4hn/im_a_junior_engineer_and_im_facing_an_ethical/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3pwc4w/dealing_with_a_toxic_employee_is_tough_how_do_you/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4rtxzx/engineering_managers_of_reddit_what_drove_you_to/)) to [annoying](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4z7ojj/how_to_get_a_google_software_engineering_job/). Many of you only want to see technical content. I get it.

This policy was inherited when I joined as moderator, and we haven't taken any huge measures to cut down on the number of them outside of having weekly threads and improving the FAQ. This is intentional, mainly because AskEngineers is one of the few places on the internet where you can get real information about a career in engineering, and have honest and valuable discussions on how to navigate the pitfalls. I think that's relevant and valuable to many of you, so career questions are here to stay.

However, we'll try to do a better job of cleaning up low-quality posts by locking them and warning users to read our Content Guidelines before posting. How well we do depends on you helping us out by reporting bad posts. Repeat offenders will be subject to temporary and/or permanent bans. I get the feeling that we're letting too many of the ""annoying"" threads have a free pass without any consequences, but I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts on this.

If you're looking for technical content, here are numerous forums that are strictly for this purpose, such as [engineering.StackExchange](http://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions), [eng-tips](http://www.eng-tips.com/), and various subreddits (listed in the sidebar).

That about covers everything new for now. We're still working on getting everything integrated, but stay tuned for a new flair application thread soon. We're also recruiting new moderators in the near future.

I`m a Computer Engineering student and I have been tasked to interview an engineer/s with a short few questions.

1. What kind of English do you use in your work?
2. Describe your community at work.
3. Does your field have any kind of culture that is different from the normal or quite striking

Examples of these are
-Structure
-Rules
-Organization
-Freedom,Religion (For Example the lack thereof or the freedom of doing anything)

4.In your words. How is language important in your field.

If you wanna include personal details like nicknames to help me reference you go ahead.

These are all of it :)

I'm trying to build my perfect desk and I come to the engineers because I'm worried about sturdiness and integrity. I assume it will be [easy thinking](http://spinningtardis.imgur.com/all/?) for you guys.

 It will be built out of 3/4"" maple plywood and 1 1/2"" metal piping. I planned to use a [Floor Flange] (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058DQLAC/ref=pd_cp_0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=08K7HGM3903N94XNT9QK) for all the connections of pipe to wood, but I don't want to spend $200 on flanges alone. Unless I can find them for half the price or less, I need an alternative.

Also I'm completely unsure about connecting the wings to the center. Would it be fine to use the piece of wood I have on there? Do I need to use flat metal brackets or something else?

Will the shelves be able to hold at least ten pounds on the edge? Or at all? How can I reinforce them without making major changes?

I'm just trying to find out if I can get away with using a diesel v8 as a stressed component of the chassis comfortably when it will have such high cylinder pressures with torque valleys nearly reaching less than 10% of mean torque between each cylinder firing or will it be too harsh and I'd have to resort to the v12. 

Please answer this in depth as possible, thank you. 

V8 and V12 both use the same CC per cylinder (lets use 330cc) with a bore:stroke ratio of .85:1, both engines capped at 400 HP @ 500 less rpm than their respective rev limits

The v8 (2640cc) is 90 degree bank angle has properly counter weighted cross plane crankshaft to counter primary forces and moments.

It will use the GM LS/Ford Windsor firing order

(4500 max rpm) (couldn't edit out the title part)

V12 , (3960cc) 60 degree bank angle

standard firing order

(3500 max rpm)

From what I know, both engines are balanced in primary and secondary forces and moments, though the crankshaft of the V12's is longer and symmetrical. 
The v8 however has an asymmetrical crankshaft and has larger and heavier counterweights on both ends of the crankshaft which oppose directions, though the momentum being canceled out by each piston when at TDC or BDC on both banks on crank angle degrees 45,135, 225, and 315, would every other angle than these have the heavier opposing direction counterweights on each end rock the engine? What about the Unevenly timed combustion, intake, compression, exhaust on each individual bank of four cylinders, will that cause much vibration? The V12 will have more frequent combustion events and less pressure per cylinder than the V8,

Electrical Engineering student going into his third year here. My Digital Systems professor over the summer has this odd thing where he refuses to answer my questions regarding electronics beyond the course material. He simply says I'll learn it in X course or just not this course. I just vastly prefer learning via discussion so I'm a little annoyed, but I understand he doesn't want to confuse me. Other faculty I've met are bored talking to me due to my relatively small sphere of knowledge. 

1. What are some common methods for preventing signal degradation in flip-flops? I've just been introduced to the logic gate layout. When S and R or J and K or what-have-you are zero, how do we keep the ""stored"" value of Q from being lost due to voltage drop over gates?

2. I don't quite understand how signals begin and end. I mean I get that it's the flow of current, but I don't see how feedback is possible. Consider an unstable feedback loop with a buffer (Like a ring oscillator, I believe). It doesn't make sense to me that current would flow, and stop, and flow, and stop. Clearly I don't have a solid understanding of what a signal *is*.

3. How do we dope materials to make transistors on such a small scale? 

4. How do you design a flip-flop to take input on both the rising and falling clock? Is this an expansion on the concept of ""holding"" the value in an intermediate latch and then passing it upon a change in clock?

5. Now my understanding of electricity from physics tells me we can't instantly go from 0 V to 5 V without some sort of delay, rather than a rectangle a square wave is surely more like a series of plateau-ing exponential growths, right? How do we prevent issues from these ""intermediary"" levels? Or do they not cause issues at all?

I know a lot of these questions come from me being introduced to the logic approach before any material on hardware, I apologize for the lengthy post.

Carriage is dropped and guided along rails via linear bushings, impacts anvil at the center of gravity directly in between the rails. (Ignore the bent tubes at the base)

I can't use ball bearings or other fairly sophisticated linear motion devices as I plan to have the carriage moving at a peak 15 m/s and bearing loads during impact could reach as high as 40 kN if there is misalignment, so I've been looking closely at brass/bronze bushings instead. This leads me to my problem;

Any alloy rated for high loads is limited to low speeds (galling and seizing problems), and anything rated for high speed is limited to low loads (deformation problems). That being said, while the carriage is falling the loads on the bushings will be minuscule, and when the loads are high the speed will already have decreased dramatically. Can I use a harder alloy like aluminum bronze or manganese bronze for this application (even though they are rated for low speeds) and avoid galling and the like during free fall because the loads are low, or do I need to use a softer alloy to achieve these speeds?

Okay so lets say we're comparing 2 turbocharged engines with identical displacement, and peak power output of 500 HP, but the differences are the number of cylinders and the amount of rpm and boost required to reach 500hp output, (let all other performance variables such as direct injection, equal length headers, or 4 valves per cylinder, etc be the same and turbocharger(s) are optimized for each engine).

The v6 will be 90 degree bank angle with shared crankpins, so odd firing order of 150-90-150-90-150-90 but even per bank (240-240-240)

The v8 will be 90 degree bank angle, crossplane crankshaft, so even firing order of 90-90-90-90-90-90-90-90 but odd per bank (180-90-180-270)


Lets both place them at 3435cc


The v6 having a bore and stroke of (90mm x 90mm).


The v8 with a bore and stroke of (77.9mm x 90mm)


Assume the max safe recommended rpm for 90mm stroke is 7500 rpm due to max piston speed, but the v8's rpm limit will be slightly higher because of lighter reciprocating mass.


To make this easy, we'll say that each intake valve's (2 per cylinder) area is 30% of the cylinder bore area and each exhaust valve (2 per cylinder) is 20% of the cylinder bore area, we'll use this for both engines. No matter what percentage you use for the areas of the valves, the v8 will always have more total valve area. In this case, the v6's total would be 162mm for intake, 108mm for exhaust, and the v8's would be 187.1mm for intake, 124.7mm for exhaust, (even though the v8's Bore:stroke ratio is UNDERSQUARE it still has over 13% more total valve area).


The v8 also has the advantage that it's bore:stroke ratio is about .866:1, or 86.6% which gives it less surface area to volume ratio, this promotes far better thermal efficiency, so better fuel burn, and allows for the use of a higher compression ratio on the same octane fuel than the v6 before having to worry about detonation. Thus increases fuel economy and power, though higher frictional losses.

How much more boost and rpm would the v6 (90x90mm) require to make equal power to the v8 (77.9x90mm), and at that point, which would have better fuel economy?

note: this is NOT a homework question. It's out of my curiosity and enthusiasm for motorsports, and my quest of over 4 years to find the optimal engine configuration for my intentions of use. And I also plan on building a custom engine in the future, so it's relevant to my finances.

I recently assumed the volunteer role of range warden at a local shooting range.  We have a large AR500 steel  (hardened to between BNH 504 and 519) backstop, angled up from the floor at 15 degrees.  Bullets strike the backstop and are directed up into a ""bullet trap"" near the ceiling.

The previous warden has taken to spraying the entire backstop down with a thin coat of lubricating oil (it's red, I think it might be hydraulic fluid?) purportedly to reduce the wear on the backstop as it is struck by projectiles (bullets of various weights and speeds).

My question is, would a thin coating of ANY kind of lubricant do anything to reduce the ablation of such a steel backstop when it is being struck by projectiles traveling anywhere between 1000 and 3000 ft/s?

The room has about 75 m3 , the Peltier module is 40x40mm 55W and fans on both sides have 110 CFM. Theoretically in about 40min all air in the room should be 'processed' (110 CFM = 3.11485m3/min).   

Now, to calculate whether the 55W Peltier is enough:

Q = m * Cp * (T1 - T2)    

, where Q is heat, m is air mass, Cp is air capacity (0.716 kJ/kg.K) and T1-T2 is temperature difference.

Air mass is:

m = V * d

d is air density, cca 1.225 kg/m3, V is 75 m3, so m = 91.875 kg

Then for a difference of 20K (40C - 20C):

Q = 91.875 * 0.716 * 20 = 1315.65 kJ

The fans have CFM of 110, that is 0.05191416666 m3/s per fan

The heatsink has volume 0.12 * 0.12 * 0.02 m = 0.000288 m3

So the air 'stays' on the heat sink for 0.0055 s

For one heatsink volume with that 110 CFM fan the Peltier transfers this much heat: 

Q = P × t 

Q = 55W * 0.0055s 

Q = 0.3025 J = 0.0003025 kJ 


So one exchange of the room volume (40min) will decrease the room temperature by:

Q = m * Cp * (T1 - T2)    [kJ] 

 (T1 - T2) = Q / (m * Cp) 

 (T1 - T2) =  0.0003025kJ * 75m3 / ( 91.875kg * 0.716 kJ/kg.K) 

 (T1 - T2) = 0.0226875 / 65.7825 = 3.44e-4 K = 3.44e-4 C 


Even with the most powerful 135W peltier the difference would be only 8.44e-4 C.

Two solid SS discs are attached via couplers to the two output shafts. I have an 18 inch diameter disc connected to the hollow shaft (which rotates at the 1:1 ratio) and another slightly smaller disc connected to the 12 gear shaft. 
The motor we used was a Panasonic Motor (Model Number - M91Z90GV4L) max speed of 1400 RPM and the gearbox used had a 36:1 reduction ratio (Model number - MZ9G36B). 

According to my calculations, I need a torque of approximately 0.36 Nm.
I obtained this by first calculating the masses of the two discs, and their couplers. My total mass was around 8.72 Kgs. I then calculated the Moment of Inertia (I) by using the formula: I = (1/2)*M*(R^2) = (0.5 * 8.72 * 0.4572 m) = 0.91 kg.m^2
If I need a speed of 15 RPM, I calculated the Angular Velocity 'w' = (RPM*2*pi)/60 = 1.57 rad/s. 
This would be my final angular velocity. Then calculated Angular acceleration 'a' = w/t.
Now I'm confused with 't' here. i'm guessing t is the time required for me to achieve my speed. I took this as 4 seconds. So basically I want to achieve my angular speed in 4 seconds. 
Therefore 'a' = w/t = 1.57/4 = 0.393 rad/s^2

And therefore torque = I*a = 0.91 * 0.393 = 0.358 Nm. 
Obviously I haven't taken friction into consideration. The discs rest on thin 3mm circular acyrlic sheets oiled which drastically reduces my friction. It's not perfect but it works. Now with this torque requirement, and a 90 W power motor, what kind of gearbox do I use? The data sheet says the motor has a starting torque of 0.56 Nm. So this is higher than my minimum requirement. A 36:1 reduction gives me a torque rating of 13.1 Nm (data sheet). Yet my system struggles to get the discs moving. What am I missing and any suggestions would be welcome.


Thanks and sorry for the long post.

So... We are building fences and my dad is an older guy in his 60's. I didn't like to think of him leaning down and trying to drive fencing nails.

I'm expecting to use a pulley kind of like the last picture in the first album; just not a pto. At idle I can get pretty high rpm...


Where is the best place to size a belt driven air compressor? Is there a way to 'free wheel' the air compressor?

I was wondering if anyone had insights into designing a high shear mixer. At our plant we use one to mix spice powders (imagine chili, pepper etc..), water and oil into a marinade or sauce. We used to have a simple 4 blade agitator but it made a really poor job in mixing in the solids and the consistency was poor too... 

Recently we installed a high shear mixer head into our existing mixer (googled for one and then drafted and manufactured our own). This new mixer gives us a pretty solid quality but frankly when doing thicker sauces/marinades we run into performance issues. 

It seems like when the viscosity gets high enough the mixer ""stalls"" and stops mixing the ingredients properly. So far we have increased our engine power (1,5kw, 1500rpm motor now) and added a VFD (running 40-65hz right now) and it did help but the same problem still persists with thick sauces...

Using my google-fu I managed to find one pdf that outlined some design considerations for such a mixer and came across one value that seemed fitting, tip speed, which according to pdf is about 10m/s too slow in our mixer (about 15m/s currently, article recommended 23m/s to 27m/s for open head mixer)...

So, what I'm really trying to ask is   
a) would increasing tip speed improve our results  
b) how much more power do I need (if any)

Im an engineering student and i am currently having a hobby project, details of which i will not mention since that would be out of scope of this post. I feel I have hit a dead end. Here is my question. 

Basically, i have a closed torus that is hole withing ( empty ). As part of my ""device"" , the torus contains a magnet within that i wish to move within the torus by using coils spun around the torus at several places. Although I have solved most problems regarding acceleration of the magnet itself and coil/control circuitry, i am clueless about friction. 

What I mean is that from time to time, the magnet within will move around at 100-150 m/s. At such speeds, friction is obviously a problem. I have thought of putting the magnet in a ""casing"" with small wheels on it which are in contact with the inside of the torus, but i am afraid such an approach is too fragile and the wheels will rapture because of the forces that push the casing towards the inside of the torus. 

(here is a simple paint drwaing to illustrate what i mean )

We'll call it L. For the case here, larger is ""better"", or the result I want to achieve. Seven vehicle components are being studied, each with two levels: nominal or degraded (good condition vs. worn). Given two levels for each of 7 components, the possible combinations to test are 2^7 =128. This is what prompted my partner here to look into Taguchi to try to go about this efficiently.

With all degraded components, L is largest. However, this is clearly not realistic. By simply making one component nominal, L drops dramatically, so I'd like to find the combination(s) that give me the highest L while representing a realistic good/worn configuration. There are no noise factors involved that I can think of without purposely creating them (e.g. different track profiles). So, with each test combination only one L is obtained.

Taking an example straight from a Taguchi document we have here, I did a trial of 8 test runs of 4/7 worn combinations and looked at how much each component contributed to the variation of the results. I got results but I'm not 100% sure how to interpret them or if Taguchi was the best method to use. So here are a few questions,

1. If there is a possible interaction between two variables, e.g. AxB, which needs to be added to the control factor array, am I correct in that the AxB column doesn't have to immediately follow columns A and B? A coworker said order is important but I don't see matrix operations that require this.

2. I feel like the analysis isn't complete. I only tested 8 4/7 combinations which was presented in our resource but what about all the rest? Is the point of Taguchi to take a limited size grouping and let the math point to the top candidates?

3. My application fortunately requires only a simplified Taguchi analysis, but is this the best way to go about my investigation? Do you have other methods to recommend?

I am surprised that there are no discussions on this forum about this. I have always, wondered how much more speed (with very low loss on efficiency) we would squeeze out of the Model S if a magnetic transmission was used to translate the high torque of the motor to higher speeds at lower torque.

Its like this:
[Drawing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7IOavQsGdsfMzlndnBRWkgwTDg/view?usp=sharing)

All gases have the same heat capacity 34 J/mol*k

One inlet with a fixed flow of cold gas at a fixed temperature, this gets seperated into two seperate flows.
Fixed flow:
355.15k
363.65 mol/s

Flow 1 - Passes trough heatexchanger 1 and gets warmed up. 
Flow 2 - Bypasses heatexchanger 1.

The amount bypassing  heatexchanger 1 is controlled by a valve fitted at the bypass pipe. There are no valves on the heatexchanger inlet.

After heatexchanger 1 is either passed or bypassed these two gasflows joins again to form 1 flow, which then passes trough heatexchanger 2 and gets even more warmed up.

I want to build a simulator that controls the temperature output after heatexchanger 2 by controlling the valved fitted at the bypass on heatexchanger 1.

For heatexchanger 1:
Cold flow in may vary depending on how much is sent trough the bypass, but the temperature is fixed at 355.15k.
Hot flowrate in is fixed at 402.13mol/s , but hot temperature may vary a few degrees.

Heatexchanger data:
A=2095m2 
U=20W/(m2*k)

For heatexchanger 2:
Cold inlet has a fixed flow at 363.65mol/s but temperature varies depending on:(cold out from heatexchanger 1 mixed with the bypass at heatexchanger 1).
Hot flow may vary and hot gas temperature in may vary.

Heatexchanger data:
A = 269m2
U = 20W/(m2*k)


How do I proceed to do this ? Do I need any more information?
I tried to build a script for the heatexchanger calculations (temperatures out) but ive understood that these might interfere with my finished model and I had to remove them and start over.

To get the final temperature the method I used was to sum up all the energy from each of the flows out of heatexchanger 1 and then calculate the new temperature after the two flows had been combined (input on heatexchanger 2).
From there I simply added the energy accumulated to the cold gas in heatexchanger 2, and divided it on flow and heat capacity to get the gas temperature after heatexchanger 2. 

I really hope somone can help me with this as ive been stuck for a while and its been kinda hard to get the help needed.
I know a little linear systems and process controlling but not much.

For a safe lane change, we must look sideways (any car there?) and behind (any car coming down the lane at high speed?) Even an aspiring geek knows: Radar and camera look forward, they are blind in other directions. Those puny ultrasonic sensors (think 1978 vintage Polaroid SX-70, if you were already alive) are barely enough to be helpful in a parking lot. If an automatic lane-changer relies on ultrasonics that develop range anxiety after 4 meters, it will turn into a serial killer of cars in the other lane.

His argument seems pretty convincing ... how can 16 feet range sensors be sufficient? What if the speed differential is too great when the driver of a Telsa is initiating a lane change? Wouldn't that just be an accident waiting to happen?

Let's say we have a Tesla in the right-hand lane and a regular car in the left hand lane. The Tesla driver initiates a lane change. The speed differential between the two cars is 20 mph while the LH car is 20 feet behind the Tesla. 20 mph is about 30 feet per second. The Tesla doesn't see the LH car because it's out of range. But in 5 feet / (30 ft/s) time, there's about to be an unholy matrimony of cars. That's 0.166 seconds. Human reaction time toward a visual stimulus is 0.25 seconds. 0.166 &lt; 0.25. That's not counting the time needed to slow down the car either. 0.166 seconds can kill someone. How can the Tesla's lane changing function work if its range is so limited?

I'm an engineering student and I know a bit about failure analysis, but I specialize in polymers and not ceramics. Today, my roommate and I left our apartment in the morning and came home at around 6 pm to find that our apartment's sliding (tempered glass) door  had shattered. We took pictures of the door as soon as we noticed it and I have [uploaded these pictures](http://imgur.com/a/mqMJ9) (sorry for the poor quality). 

Today happened to be colder in the morning (low 40's F) and hotter in the afternoon (73 F with direct sunlight). Only the inside pane fractured, and the outer pane doesn't have any visible damage. Also, this window faces due north, meaning that the afternoon sunlight shines on the right side of our door while the left side is in the shade (the left-side of the door is shaded by brick due to the building architecture). 

In my opinion, I think our door fractured due to thermal loads based on the fracture pattern of the glass. Specifically, there's no particular crack origin that I can see except for two in the bottom right corner of the door. I've been doing a little internet research and I've found that other people have had similar problems ([Dale McKibben's quote here](http://chicagowindowexpert.com/2009/06/20/diagnosing-glass-breakage/)) . I also looked up fracture patterns of tempered glass [\(pages 39 &amp; 40 here\)](http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/pvrw2010_barry.pdf) and found images similar to what we found.

The reason I'm asking for help is because our landlord wants us to pay $300 to replace the window. To be honest, I would suck it up and pay if the crew who came to take the shattered pane away hadn't told us that ""[he'd] been doing this for 12 years and knows that it is scientifically impossible for the inside pane of the door to shatter unless [we] had broken it"".

I.e. good macadamia nuts will float in tap water (s.g. 1.0) and bad ones will sink. If you take those bad ones and put them in a salt solution with an specific gravity of 1.025 the really bad ones will sink and the in-between quality ones will float. The average nut has a bulk density of 600kg/m3 but I don't know the specific gravity but I suspect it must be somewhere around 1000kg/m3 in order to be lighter than the water to float.

I've tied googling and am either not smart enough to see a solution or didn't understand it when I was looking at it.

I'm just trying to avoid some trial and error during some testing.

I've been reading in Ullmann's Encyclopedia in the Sulfuric Acid and Sulfur Trioxide sections. I'm specifically putting focus on the Double Contact (Double Absorption) process, with [elemental sulfur + air] as feed. Maybe I'm just rusty, or I'm an idiot (most probable reason), but there's a couple of things that I don't get.

1. It doesn't seem that the process is as relatively simple as most in-out processes. Most documents I've read include oleum as a component, without actually mentioning why it exists in the process. Is it an intermediate? An inevitability of a product?

2. I read a few pfds where they use some H2SO4 to dry the incoming air to be used for the sulfur burning. From what I can understand, they channeled some of the strong acid from the product to purposely absorb some of the moisture from the dry air to ensure that there's no water to poison the catalyst downstream. But that would mean they need to do a startup run till the acid reaches steady state, right?

3. Why do plants use &gt;1000 C to burn the sulfur? The boiling point itself is at like 400ish C. Is that the temp required for the S + O2 -&gt; SO2 reaction to happen?

I'll probably have more questions along the line. Would be nice to get a sulfuric acid plant expert of some sort for me to talk with in an instant-message manner, so I can relay the questions at a more rapid pace, since I'm kinda on the deadline, and I want to settle this quickly and be able to come up with a general pfd by Monday.

Most of my classmates are stuck doing straight maintenance, even a lot of mechanical maintenance. I am very fortunate enough to work for a company where I not only do maintenance for, but also custom automation projects. I have gone from not knowing a simple battery works, to troubleshooting PLC programs, writing programs, designing HMI's, some communication stuff, etc. I plan to go back to school very soon to get my BS in Mechatronics.

Although I am very happy with my progress so far, my capabilities seem very....insignificant?....for lack of a better word. There is so much information to be acquired out there that it is extremely overwhelming. Like....SCADA. I know NOTHING of SCADA. All sorts of different types of communications TCP/IP, Modbus, etc. Sensors, different characteristics of 3 phase motors/generators. Servo motors and stepper motors which I have no experience with. Actually making a beautiful and aesthetically pleasing ladder program. SFC's. Structured text. Networking. I could keep going obviously, but you get my point. Every night I am reading portions out of books I've bought so I can keep increasing my knowledge. I feel like I am in fucking law school here, and I'm not even in school at the moment. It's insane.

My confidence level is always going up, but gets equally shot down all the time because I run into a problem or some type of equipment that I've never seen before, or don't know how to deal with. I would like to be making $85k/year by my mid 30's at least.

I guess the end all be all would be to assemble it in the garage, understand the process then disassemble / reassemble in the bedroom, but assembling it in such a tight space could be pretty difficult, the desks already pretty big for the room to begin with.

Second, if I do have to go back to school, roughly how long would it take?  I  have credits for all the required math courses (Cal, Diff Eq, Linear Algebra) and two semesters of physics (Classical, and Magnetic/Electrical), and two semester of programming.

Thirdly, how would someone making this kind of career switch look to employers?

Basically my EEE project is to model a wind turbine and its generator and produce a PID controller, with the wind-tip-speed ratio (lambda) and blade pitch(beta) as my 2 inputs.

My defining equation is:
J.dw/dt = Te - Tm 
where J=inertia, w=angular speed, Te is the electrical torque ie the torque being generated by the turbine, and Tm is the mechanical opposing torque produced by the generator. 

Te is = Pv.Cq where Pv=wind power and Cq is torque coefficient=Cp/lambda where Cp is power coefficient, a non linear function which I have linearised. Cq is a function of lambda and beta.  

Tm is, according to my tutor = c.w^2 where c is a generator constant called 'drag torque to speed constant'. My tutor says -&gt;'If you want to simplify this to be Tm=c*w, it has to be for small region of the rotational speed. I would prefer to keep it in quadratic term and linearize later around certain speed.' 

After I linearise Cq my eqn becomes: 
J.dw/dt = a.lambda + b.Beta - c.w^2.

So my actual question(s) are 1) can any one shred any light on the  'drag torque speed constant' as I am really struggling to find info on it? 

and 2) how can I produce the transfer function with the w^2 term.
How do I Laplace transform w^2 to get just a w(s) term so that I can have my transfer function's G1= w(s)/lambda(s) and G2=w(s)/beta(s)?

I'm currently trying to build a standing desk for myself and a couple of friends. I know that in the USA &amp; Europe there are fairly numerous options to choose from, but in Brazil we have none. 

After some research I managed to get a hold on some Linak's DL7 Lifting Columns. They have a reseller here in Brazil. Linak seems to be the top standard for lifting columns (providing to some of the major builders).

The issue I've stumbled upon with is that Linak doesn't provide the feet or stabilizing bar for the columns. I have to build them myself. And this is where I turn into a moron. I have zero background in engineering/materials and next to zero in modeling. But I've decided to do this and here I am.

I've managed to build a [SketchUp Model](http://i.imgur.com/yKW8ndO.png) of the proposed design for the tabletop and desk structure. But I have some questions about my solution for the foot.

-- 

From a design/ergonomic stand point I need it (the base that connects and holds the columns) to be the shortest possible. I've chosen a 1/2"" inch steel plate cut to 600x100mm. The columns are fixed to them by 2 M8 screws. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/CuLr1ri.png) are the columns drawings.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/H85BZCQ.png). [And here](http://i.imgur.com/pDPEEFz.png).

These columns/desk have and adjustable height ranging from approximately 720mm to 1150mm (with the current design).

Will these plates provide enough support and not bend with the tables load? I'd say a max of 50-100Kgf load.

Should I do something different?

This knife is older than I am, and I have kept it since early childhood for nostalgic reasons. Unfortunately the use of an inappropriate lubricant(s) has caused catestrophic bearing wear in very short time. It did solve the ""It makes too much noise"" issue neatly however.

The original bearing appears to be some form of cast iron. Because the bushing needs to be self-aligning to accomodate the shaft oscillating w/ the blades, it matches a spherical socket in the body of the handle.  I do not want to alter this socket.

I have been unable to find a *ready made* spherical bushing of appropriate dimensions (with clear food safe composition), or a self-aligning roller/ball bearing that would not require modification.

Would a making one from a knot of hardwood be appropriate, or should I get a chunk of cast iron from a furniture shop?

-   Reversing the bearing so that the (previously) intact end points torwards the gears.  After a few uses that end got flogged out too. 
-   A oil-wetted paper bushing insert to remove the slack.  Got pulled out by the worm gear and impressively compacted after a few uses. Wore down the middle, making the wear suprisingly parallel.
-   Skate bearing. Misunderstood part code and ordered incompatible size.

I know it's ideal for something this heavy to lie across a bunch of joists, so we are concerned that the weight will be an issue.

We asked the designer, who said it's out of her depth; we need an engineer's opinion. Would we need to reinforce the joist(s) under the tank, or are we looking at something more substantial like a beam underneath it, or maybe some kind of platform/post arrangement in the basement? 

The aquarium is 72""l x 24""w, with the long side against an outside wall. One end will be also very close to (about 12"") a second outside wall. 

The glass tank holds 180g of water, plus rocks and sand. The tank alone is a couple hundred pounds; we estimate it weighs over a tonne when it's full. 

Right now we are in an apartment with concrete floors, so we have never had to worry about the weight of our tank. The last thing we want to do is stress the structure of the new house, so we're willing to do whatever is necessary and then some.

My heat exchanger is this:
http://i.imgur.com/X4PRZ6N.jpg

Measurements is in cm and it's 4cm thick. And every fin is basically just hanging on the underlying tubes, so no solid attachment.

It's connected to a 4x4cm aluminium water block with a pump between. Water flow is roughly 5-10ml/s :
http://i.imgur.com/UnAnCMQ.jpg

Due to lack of measurement equipments I haven't been accurately able to measure ∆T between the intake and outtake of the heat exchanger. But the available info I have is that when the system equalizes, I have ~250°C on the hot side of the thermoelectric module and the cooling water stabilizes at 60°C. The heat exchanger is only cooled by natural convection so no forced air flow.

So here is why I'm sceptic, considering the size of the heat exchanger and the amount of heat flow (~133W according to manufacturer which I doubt) I think the cooling water should stabilize at a much lower temperature! 

So the question is, is my heat exchanger a pice of crap? Or is this to be expected?

I saw a youtube video about an electric furnace capable of melting aluminium .

This video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en4yhzLuD9A

I want to build a furnace like this but I'm looking into improving it. 

That nichrome wire isn't too good above 1200C. That's not high enough to melt steel

There's kanthal wire which might go as high as 1400C. Might melt steel but it's borderline.

Next best thing appears to be a material called ""mosi2"" or Molybdenum disilicide. It should attain 1700C without the need for flooding the furnace with a oxygen free gas. (though I might do that anyway)

I think these are the best element that are still reasonably priced and will let me attain the highest possible temperature (under 500$).

This is what these elements look like.

https://i.imgur.com/VZNgAOD.png
https://i.imgur.com/qNlZdwX.png

So there is the ""L1"" portion and the ""L2"" portion.

What is the L2 part for ? Does this part of the element emit heat ? Does it have to be inside the furnace chamber or is it going to create a cold spot ?

Another issue is how to wire such heating element so that very little heat exits the chamber. I don't know how hot the connection terminal of that heating element will get but once it gets in contact with copper wire, that will sink a lot of heat, the insulation could easily melt and it might sink so much heat that it  never reaches 1700C.

Another question is how to measure the furnace temperature. K type thermocouple don't work about 1250C. S type thermocouple one ebay are 200$USD !  Are there other options under 50$USD ?

any advice appreciated !

The DCRJ works in the principals of air pressure to actuate all major components. I
am attempting to stop the rotors and turbine from spinning and allowing the stators
to spin freely around the rotors, essentially switching places with the rotors.It works
in the exact same way as a turbine jet during takeoff and landing operations. After 
climbing to altitude and reaching a sufficient air speed, which is approximately 160knots
but can change based on air density and other variables, the RAM air pressure 
begins to build at the inlet of the engine.  When the build up of air pressure occurs
it engages a braking mechanism along the compressor and turbine shaft. Once 
the braking mechanism is actuated it disengages a braking mechanism holding the 
stators from spinning.  The braking of the turbine will allow an increase of pressure along
the turbine blades which can overcome a tension system to feather them until the air 
flow is as smooth as possible.  The stators are spun around the rotor blades due to 
the ducted fins that are coiled around the outside.  These fins do not create any extra
drag because of a tension spring flap on the leading edge of the nacelle. The duct that 
is exposed when the tension spring is overcome by air pressure, is also used to

The dry air enters at 20°C and leaves the tube after 300mm with atemperature at 250°C (air velocity of 7m/s at constant 3bar). 

The velocity seems to be very low for such a low temperature?

Edit: The way i calculated it 

Nusselts - Numer -&gt; heatcoffecient -&gt; calc the heatflow with the logarithmic mean temperature difference -&gt; solved : heatflow = massflow * Specific isobaric heat capacity * deltaT  for the outgoing Temperature

with deltaT = temperature at the end - temperature at the beginning

I wanted to know the velocity needed to have an end temperature of 250°C. With an iterative method of calculating lots of air velocity i got the closest air velocity to that end temperature of 250°C.

Took all Physical properties at the meantemperature and used a literature coefficent to adjust for the temperature dependence of the properties of air.

Or the relationship between the speed of the plunger and flow rate at the tip of the needle (Again assuming that the properties of the liquid in the barrel is known).


I have very limited knowledge in fluid dynamics.

I made a quick research and found the Poiseuille's law for laminar flow


Flowrate= π.r^4 (P-P0) / 8.η.L


where r is the radius of the pipe or tube, P0 is the fluid pressure at one end of the pipe, P is the fluid pressure at the other end of the pipe, η is the fluid's viscosity, and L is the length of the pipe or tube 


P0 will be atmospheric pressure if I assume I am injecting in air.


P will be the pressure on the syringe plunger r is the radius of the barrel


η is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid L is the length of the fluid inside the barrel.


The flow rate unit is m^3/s when I use the SI units.


Also I have the Bernoulli's law to calculate the pressure difference between the syringe barrel, hub and needle, when their cross-section area is given.


So, I will be converting the Pressure at the tip of the needle (which is shown as pressure P2 on the illustration) to pressure at the barrel of the syringe to use for the parameter P0. Am I correct at this point?


Also, therefore, the length I will be using for the parameter L is the dashed red line, which is the distance between the plunger and end of the barrel. This is my assumption, since I already convert the pressure at the tip of the needle to barrel of the syringe. Is this correct?


If I am all correct up until this point, my last question is the following; I am assuming that I can exert enough pressure for the desired flow rate. How can I convert the P parameter into speed so that I can calculate the speed of the plunger for the desired flow rate?


[Here is an illustration for the syringe](http://i.imgur.com/FlAyQil.jpg)


My attempt is this; P = F/S


Where S is the surface area of the plunger pushing the liquid.


F = m.a


a = dv/dt


So, P = (m.dv/dt)/S


And when the desired flow rate is given, I would leave the dv/dt term on the left hand side and everything else on the right hand side, then take the integral of both sides to find the Velocity.


I am not sure though.

I'm a mechanical engineering undergrad and am currently working on a pneumatic spud gun. I have taken fluid mechanics. However, the problems I have cannot be resolved via my textbook nor my notes (or maybe they can but honestly I don't have time to reread them all). My basic design for this cannon consists of a steel tank as my air chamber that is connected to a ball valve. This valve then connects to a 180 degree bend pipe that ultimately connects to my barrel. I'm having trouble calculating my output velocity based on Bernoulli's eqn. I cannot imagine that the muzzle velocity would not depend on the diameters/volumes of my pipes. Obviously, my air chamber is going to have a larger diameter than the valve/U pipe/barrel. I'm trying to figure out which equation(s) I'd use to be able to design this thing. Any help would be immensely appreciated. Thank you. Also, I will provide additional details of my general design idea need be.

Somebody in /r/engineers made it apparent to me that I should analyze this thing from a static standpoint at first - moving the projectile in each analysis to a different state and calculating pressures at those different states. This sounds like a good idea - I just don't know what equations I should be using.

I was wanting to make a hot air engine, using a car turbocharger(s) if possible.
(Hot Air engine was chosen to escape safety concerns of water, car turbocharger was chosen as a good quality low cost turbine/compressor that is widely available - if this is not the case please tell me :D)

Like all good engineering projects I want the world, and I want it all for nothing :D

I have a 21kw heat source connected to a 1.5m^2 heat exchanger, the heat exchanger is shaped like a U (cross-section,but upside down) exhaust gasses are piped into the top of the U and fall down as they cool. Expected temperature at the top of the U is ~500C. Expected heat exchanger material is mild steel. cold compressed air will be blown in at the bottom of the U, at a tangent to the edge to induce a vortex, and extracted from the centre of the top of the U
(heat source is a wood furnace)

I would like to get an electrical output of about 1.5kw to charge batteries. (but like the stones sing, you cant always get what you want)

how does the turbocharger efficiency map relate to the possible power output? some i have seen have an efficiency of just 77%. I am hoping that since this engine will not have varied power requirements (like a car) i will be able to park the turbo at its most efficient point and leave it there.

Most turbo's will only raise the pressure by 2:1, how many stages before my after compression temperature is the same as my heat source (500C)? How many stages before the friction losses in the compressors eat away all my power output? How do i determine the optimum number of stages?

Finally i would like ideas on how to convert high pressure hot air into electricity. currently i have thought of a power shaft off one of the compressors, A separate turbine from a larger turbo, or an electric supercharger.

I realise this may not be feasible, but i would like to work through the problem to identify the reasons it may not work for my own education.

Thanks in advance for your help and time educating me.

I was inspired by reading the [Ericsson cycle page on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ericsson_cycle) and also the [nuclear powered aircraft page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Nuclear_Propulsion), which made me realise that i had no idea why a jet turbine worked, and caused me to think more in depth about how a gas turbine works.",,,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,,,self,Designing an External Combustion Gas turbine,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/41p5b7/designing_an_external_combustion_gas_turbine/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,1430189594.0,{},{},

I've been analyzing some Event Data Recorder information and looking at the deceleration, and wanted to know how it compares to actual maximum deceleration.  
Let's say the car manufacturer reports that the braking distance is 136FT (41.5m) when going from 60MPH (26.82m/s) to zero. I calculated it out and it looks like it assumed a coefficient of friction of 0.89, and if I assume constant deceleration, then it ends up at 8.68m/s^2.  
So then, from the car EDR report, I calculated out that I was braking from a speed of 6.94m/s to 0.28 m/s over a period of 1 second, calculating out to a braking deceleration of 6.67m/s^2. This is about 77% of the maximum braking deceleration. At the time, the tires were in great shape, and the roads were dry, so I'd think the coefficient of friction should still have been close to 0.8.  
So, does a braking deceleration of 77% of maximum (pedal pushed all the way to the floor) under normal, dry conditions jive?  

**TL;DR** Pushed brake pedal to the floor, decelerated at 6.67m/s^2 versus actual car literature of 8.68m/s^2 with dry conditions, good tires, good brakes. Do actual conditions result in 23% loss of braking deceleration versus published?

I graduated with a focus in mechanical design, and did not take the FEA technical elective. I graduated with a B /B+ average GPA, however I quickly forget what I learned in school. My job mainly consists of creating CAD models of parts / assemblies and creating the technical drawings for those parts and assemblies (Gd&amp;T), creating BOMs, contacting machine shops, updating the companies inventory, assembly work, and developing new ways of achieving what my company wants on the mechanical side of things. I can create parts that are machined, laser cut, bent (sheet metal),  printable, and I believe I could make a part suitable for injection molding. However my job is lacking in any real sort of machine design, stress analysis, kinematic / dynamic analysis, FEA (nothing thermal, nothing fluid), and I am quickly forgetting what I learned about these subjects. I basically know how to create a part that is machinable, how to create a technical drawing for that part, and contact a machine shop to make that part. I am grateful to have gotten a job right out of college, but the lack of a mentor or any work that will expand my knowledge of engineering in any area is becoming increasingly alarming to me. My question to you is: How will this experience look to possible employers? Is this typical of an entry level ME job, or am I doing work that is typically reserved for technicians / drafters while my engineering skills fall by the wayside? Any advice on what I can do to make myself more appealing to the job market as an engineer?

A friend would like to know whya cylinder wouldn't make a good low speed projectile, and I figured that it wouldn't be difficult to find out exactly what a cylinder does moving through air. Admittedly, my search-fu is weak, but the results are all either looking at airflow on a cylinder from the wrong face, or looking at square cylinders. 
The Question: 
Given a circular cylinder, made of an arbitrary steel, with diameter 20mm and length 60mm, how does it fly through the air, blunt end first, if it is moving at ~100m/s

I'm pretty sure that the cylinder would tumble, or kind of ""take off"" sideways seemingly randomly and the result would be incredible innacuracy. I was just hoping to find a paper, video, or write up of some type explaining why. 

Ideally, I would like if someone could recommend a simulator (free, broke college student here) for problems like this that I can download and use. I'm not a mechanical major, and haven't taken any relevant coursework for this sort of thing. If someone could also answer, or even better provide a link to an answer or video (so I can show the link instead of a reddit comment), I would be very grateful!

I am starting to apply for university and am feeling immensely overwhelmed with the number of choices. I have a few that have piqued my interest but am open to suggestions. Mechanical, mining, petroleum, aerospace, computer, and architectural all seem interesting.


**Mechanical:**
Seems like the most common major and always in demand. Seems interesting but I would appreciate a higher paying major.


**Mining:**
I don't have much to say about this major but it does seem somewhat interesting and, from what I've read, pays well.


**Petroleum:**
Petroleum is large in Canada and pays very well, and honestly that is what piqued my interest. I am worried about the job prospects in this field.


**Aerospace:**
I've always had an interest in aircraft, and it pays well too. Again, I am worried about job prospects in this field and don't particularly enjoy the places these jobs are. (Typically east of Canada.)


**Computer:**
I wouldn't say I love it but I definitely would like to learn more about the hardware and software sides of computing. Pays well and I can see a large increase in jobs in the future.


**Architectural:**
Physics is my best course and from what I've seen the pay for this major tends to be quite large.



As a sidebar I am also interested in any input as to good schools for engineering in Canada. I am currently thinking UBC Okanagan, or BCIT. I do not have the grades (mine tend to be low-mid 80's) for U of A and I have also heard it is overly competitive.


Any input is much appreciated, thanks!

**Edit:** How unrealistic would it be to obtain two degrees? I've heard most degrees are the same for the first two years. Would it be possible to get Mechanical degree for four years and then return to thirst year of Petroleum or would I have to start from first year again?

I recently took a class on PLC programming, trouble shooting, and wiring, so I've got only the slightest bit of knowledge on them.  

The older engineer I work with has a bit of experience with Allen Bradley, so when I wanted to get a PLC for a project he suggested to go with an AB Micrologix 1000 (this is also what I used in the class).  But after a bit of research it appears that the Micrologix 1000 will be discontinued in about a year and a half.

AB's website recommends the Micro800's as a replacement, but after downloading Connected Components, it seems like a horrible software package over RSLogix.  The older engineer agrees, and is even more angry at Connected Components than I am.

So, what are my choices?  The company is open to whatever direction myself and the other engineer can settle on.  The other engineer is a bit out of his comfort zone, and once he found out the Micrologix 1000's were being discontinued, he kinda pushed it on to me.

Is Connected Components something I'll learn to like?  I've spent a couple days messing around on it, and it seems like programming time is a lot longer and just sub par when compared to RSLogix.  What's the real difference between the Micrologix 1000's and 1100's?

I'm currently trying to prototype a little do-hickey toy that needs an adjustable rail. Ideally the rail would be a rectangle of aircraft aluminum that's really small. Something like 1/4'' by 1/8'' that can expand in segments like a car antenna maybe up to 6'' long. I'm trying to find where something like this could be made and/or how I could make one.

Hi everybody!

I'm a first year student (after a few years off between high school and now). I haven't taken any physics or engineering classes yet, so bear with me. Sorry for the wall of text.

I'm part of a student-lead group that is designing a suborbital payload that will launch on a NASA sounding rocket in August (we are totally **extra curricular;** our only ties to school are a loose administrative framework that ensures that we're covered in case anybody gets hurt building the thing. This is not a homework/school assignment question).

We are working with some pretty severe constraints, and are trying to come up with an ultra compact, but still highly robust mechanism that will drive some mechanical booms. The mechanism has a 1.75"" height constraint, and a 12"" diameter, and we need at least 11.5"" of extension on four booms. Furthermore, the mechanism will be exposed to hard vacuum, and brutal thermal transitions (+/-200°F in a matter of seconds).

Underneath the mechanism is a sealed enclosure that will house a couple of side experiments, the flight computer, and a motor to drive the mechanism up top. The motor shaft will pass through the ceiling of the enclosure with a dynamic seal (lots of o-rings and silicone grease).

The mechanism we hope to implement is a planetary gear drive where the ring gear is toothed on both sides. The outer ring drives four pinions, and their racks.

[Here's](http://imgur.com/dYDIR9U) a quick little diagram I made. And [here](http://imgur.com/rWd4h7x) is my 3D model of the mechanism. Modeling the ring, sun, and planet gears' teeth in TinkerCAD is something I don't have the patience for, so use your imagination.

The sun gear is the input, and the planets are constrained so that they rotate the ring gear. The outside of the ring gear is also toothed, and contacts some small pinions, which then drive the racks which are attached to the booms we are trying to extend.

Speed is not a concern. In fact, there's a speed limit of 1""/s. This is my own design and I know next to nothing about gears and ratios and all that jazz, other than the fact that they're pretty complicated. BUT, we're not looking to do any exact reductions or anything like that. We just need a way to drive those satellite gears all the exact same amount, at the same speed. The only thing we need to retain is the torque necessary to articulate the booms because there will be about a pound on the end of each boom, maybe more.

**So, my question is this: I know that when you drive a small gear with a large gear, the torque is reduced, and vice versa if the small gear is the driving gear. But if a planetary gear set is the one driving the large gear, what happens to the input torque?**

The figures claimed are, well, staggering &amp; could potentially be *game-changing*.

&amp;nbsp;

* Extended range, even versus a Tesla
* 600HP, although this isn't really anything which truly prohibits EV use
* 0.60MPH, 3.2sec, again see above

**My question is, what with it requiring a substantial 800V charge station, likely developed exclusively for the Mission E by Porsche themselves (a potential limitation), is this car likely to be prohibited from becoming not only a commercial success but successful in terms of driving the growth of EV?**

&amp;nbsp;

As an engineering student, therefore lacking the experience &amp; industry in-sight to truly judge, I see potential barriers due to the requirement for a specific charging station, branching technology &amp; the distancing from the more *universal* charging voltages of the Tesla (I say universal as they publish their technology, as opposed to Porsche who'd likely keep it secret) and the potential for those who can actually afford these cars desiring to maintain their prehistoric, brute force V8's and V10's. That said, with companies such as [Ford](https://cleantechnica.com/2015/12/11/ford-stirs-ev-pot-4-5-billion-new-evs-batteries-fast-charging/) increasing investment into EV's and with companies such as Tesla, McLaren, Ferrari &amp; Porsche proving there exists a demand for high-performance EVs, we may be on the cusp of a rapid growth of this market and I'm interested to learn more.

I am working on a system which uses a chilled water circuit (30% propylene glycol) at about 15-16GPM. [Check out the layout.](http://i.imgur.com/9KXXpbe.png) The main plumbing in the system is all 1.5"" PVC.

The center column drops down to 0.1-0-2GPM. This is confusing us, because we assume that the highest pressure in the horizontal columns should be at #1, therefore yielding the highest flow.

 I am trying my luck here to modify my HTC Re camera for different application. Basically just putting it into a case that is 50% shorter in length, same thickness,  and extends the image sensor into a smaller, cylindrical shape that mounted at the middle of the case. My main requirement is that most hardware functions (such as SD card support, reset button) as well as software function on mobile app (ios or android) work just as well after the modification. 

PCB, Battery and image sensor will have to be changed to fit inside a smaller case. My main concern is the replacement image sensor, while still capable of capturing 1080p video/ images, it also has to be smaller to fit into the new dimension at 7mm in diameter at the cylinder (from 1.5cm in diameter on the original Re Cam). Wide angle function is something that I don't need though, so the image sensing assembly could be smaller. 

Battery could be replaced with somethings smaller, and the PCB probably has to be shorter, so a customized one perhaps?

Since I am not an engineer and am hiring someone to do it for me, I want to know if it's actually doable or something that is huge pain in the ass?

Found plenty of examples online.  Here's an ""interesting"" one: http://imgur.com/a/Tvy4H  

This uses 1"" schedule 40 galvanized pipe. This table shows that this pipe can support 521 lbs at 3ft horizontal distance: http://imgur.com/O04THqo   

Using that, I try to figure out if the whole thing would collapse if I slammed on the brakes.  

So, I assumed 100lbs of kayaks (2x50 lbs) loaded on a cross member 3ft above where the pipe is mounted to the trailer.  If you brake hard and decelerate at 20ft/s^2, I figure that's 100lbs * 20ft/s^2 = 2000 lbs of force.  Let's assume this is distributed to the 4 pipes equally (uh, yeah).  That's just under the load rating of each pipe (521 vs 500).  

For now, ignore what I'm ignoring. Do I even have the units right here?  Is the force I calculated comparable to the weight in that Pipe Loading Table?  

My gut reaction is that the design looks really deficient. I'm actually looking at racks for surf boards so the weights will be lighter and the required height will be a lot lower.  Oh, and I'd join the two racks and brace the legs.  Of course, towing any trailer is probably horribly dangerous. But, I would like the rack to to survive if I slammed on the brakes.

My name is Alex (nice to meet you). I'm doing a project with a research institute that has developed a Fluidic Actuator for Active Flow Control and I need some help. I need to find some other potential applications for it and I thought that because you guys span all kinds of industries you could help me out.

Details of device:
They are compact, but size can range (smallest is about 2cm thick and 5x5 cm sides)
They generate momentum without mass-flux
They suck in and eject air in an oscillating manner, driven by the oscillation of a transducer
Require between 2 and 10 Watts to be powered
Up to 150 m/s velocity of ejected air (not the smallest one, though)
Nozzle can be placed on any side of the device

So far, I have investigated the following:
Active Flow Control for Aircraft, Cars and Windmills
Electronics Cooling
Drone Flight Stabilisation

Any new ideas would be of great help. If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer. I really appreciate any help provided.

Thank you,
Alex

I'm trying to size an 18 kW air cooled heat exchanger (HX) that needs to be mounted on a truck. The HX obviously has very tight space requirements and mass requirements (1 x 1m face area, 0.2m depth and max 60-70kg). In addition to the physical requirements, I also have a very tough power budget in terms of parasitics (max 0.6 kW for blower fans). 

Blower fan power is the most powerful factor driving the design optimization. I obviously want to keep size and mass to a minimum but I must have a sufficiently large face area to keep the pressure drop/fan power down. I am trying to find a good correlation for the air side pressure drop as I want to double check the values that I've already calculated. 

I have found several different friction factor correlations online and in books for my configuration but they can differ by a factor of 10 depending on which one I used and so the overall fan power requirement is extremely wide depending on what I use. This is the key factor driving the overall design so I have to be sure that I am within say 30% of a believable value.

Our question then is what are the optional amount of wounds around each iron core, to create the most elecrticity? Is the most amount of wounds possible best? What thickness of wire is best?(should we have thick wires with very few wounds, or very thin wires with alot of wounds) And is copper good enough?

An additional question is how large does our iron core(s) need to be?(compared to the wires. Do we have to have a small core with a lot of wounds of wires or a large core with less amount of wounds?)

The axle is 6mm in diameter

The magnet are 20mm in diameter with a lenght of 40mm(then the hole through them at a diameter of 6mm)

Don't worry too much about the braking part. If it doesn't work we will eveuntally find out.

I am completely new to CFD and have to run a couple of simulations for a project I'm doing. Please note I am using STAR-CCM+ software for this.

My model is a sootblower lance (essentially a distributing manifold with a closed end). There are 12 nozzles along the length of the manifold that the steam flows out.

I have superheated steam flowing in through the inlet.

I have never run a simulation before and I'm not quite sure how to set the physics up. I'll list my geometry values and inlet conditions below:

Length of manifold = 20m
Inside diameter of manifold = 0.06268m
Nozzle diameter = 16mm throat (convergent divergent)
Inlet mass flow = 2.65kg/s
Inlet pressure = 8 bar
Inlet velocity = 295.815m/s
Inlet Reynolds number = 2196809
Inlet temp = 675K

If anyone could give me any pointers on how to set up the physics or just any advice in general relating to the whole simulation it would be hugely appreciated!

If any further info or screenshots or anything are required just ask.

The [pack](http://www.amazon.com/Poweradd-Pilot-Pro-Multi-Voltage-Compatible/dp/B00DN0KBXU) is rated at 32,000 mAh and can deliver 20V @ 4.5 amps.  
The stepper motor is a 2-coil bipolar that has a rated current/phase of 5 amps. From Ohm's law the calculated current (I = V/R) would be 20 amps which would require a current limiting driver.  
*A motor control will always draw less than 2/3 of the motor’s rated current when it is parallel (or half-winding) connected and 1/3 of the motor’s rated current when it is series (or full-winding) connected.* [geckodrive](http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html)  
Since my stepper is rated to 5 amps per phase and at most (parallel) I'd be drawing 2/3's of 5 amps (3.33) the pack can be used as the power source since it can deliver 4.5 amps.

When I was 7 years old I had told my parents that I will pursue a career in science. 

I usually did well in school. In Ordinary Level exams I got 7A*s and 4A's. During these years even though I had other self esteem issues regarding social skills I was always confident that I am capable of pursuing my dreams in life. It also helped boost my confidence that I got a higher achiever's award. Only 7 from my entire grade got this.

After Ordinary Levels I started doing Advanced Levels where I chose Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Core Maths. After a few months my confidence vanished. A Levels was insanely hard compared to O Levels. I found that  some students managed to get decent grades with moderate effort. Some quit science altogether. However, with 6 hours sleep and studying in most of my waking hours I managed to get 3A's and a B. It takes me longer to learn something that others. I had to practice something more. After the end of those 2 years I was so exhausted that I gave up science.

I saw how my peers doing commerce put less effort and yet gained good grades. So, I thought that I am not smart enough for science and got to university to do an accounting degree.

This was far more easier than science. I had free time to do other things in life. However, I felt that something is missing in me. I envied those who say they enjoyed their jobs. Because I knew that accounting will just be a job for me. I won't enjoy doing it.  Science is where my passions lie. 

Then I read about deliberate practice and how average students get to grades using learning techniques. books - [Greatness Isn't Born. It's Grown. Here's How. eBook: Daniel Coyle:](http://www.amazon.com.au/The-Talent-Code-Greatness-Grown-ebook/dp/B0026OR1UK)

So, I transferred to do computer science. The first semester was very hard for me. Specially because I take longer to remember things than others and there is lot to learn in the short time span. I vigorously used anki to study but still found it difficult. Again my social life is terrible and having depression doesn't help it either.

I have thoughts about going back to do accounting. I will have a more balanced existence, good social life and will enjoy my  university experience. But, I'll have to bury my lifelong science dreams and settle for a job that pays the bills.   And I am not sure if I will regret it in the future. Lots of people do in forums. They wish they had done the course they were passionate in even though it was harder. If you could go back, would you major in accounting again?

     Engineers of the internet, I seek your wisdom on the following. I am building a black powder cannon, but I am relegated to a college student's budget(I have $350 for the entire project, including wood stain, finish, iron straps, etc). Luckily, most of the wood for the carriage is freely available from family, so all I need is the barrel.

I was curious:

-What is the strongest type of steel pipe? I presume steel is the strongest type of pipes commonly available.
-What is the thickest type of pipe? Ideally, I'd like a 2"" Interior Diameter, with at least a 1"" wall thickness, if not 1.5"". Heavyness is less of a factor than safety.


The pipe in question must be commonly available, and have commercially available end caps; the more threading the better. I plan to have the pipe taken to a machinist and threaded at least 6""(the entire gun length is 50"") if not longer, then ""cold"" welding the threading together. After that the end cap will be standard-welded and beveled, creating an effective barrier against any type of malfunction.

The shot will be stainless steel ball bearings. 2"" or 3"" interior diameters are preferred but I'll listen to any advice given.


For calculations, should you need to:

-Shot: 1.1lb, 3"" diameter, stainless steel
-Load: 2.0lb FFg black powder.


Old cannons were made of brass, so I can't imagine steel is going to be anywhere close to exploding, but I thought I'd post this and see what the people had to say.



Also, apologies if I did this wrong; it's my first time on Reddit. Other than reading over my friend's shoulders on r/funny.




Here is my design for a basic wheel. For scale, the larger spokes are 2x4's:


http://imgur.com/gallery/plNjYBW/new


Each box is 2x2""

The dotted lines are 'tongues' of wood inside the other pieces. So for example, the 2x4's go 4"" into the wheel rim, and are secured in place by 4 bolts. Unless screws are better?

I received a lot of helpful advice, though a lot of people suggested to try and make a variable pitch propeller instead. 

[Here](http://imgur.com/Lr5haoR) is a quick, dodgy engineering drawing that shows some dimensions (mm). The other dimesnion that is missing is the hub diameter at its widest which is 350mm.

I have a concept for a novel digital camera that I want to design and build. My background is in the arts, however, and while I am technically oriented I have never studied engineering of any sort (outside of half-assed stabs at programming). I've been dreaming about this in sketches and notes since 2013 and have gotten to the point where I have to commit to this endeavor or put it aside.

That said, it occurs to me that the best way to realize my ambition may be to collaborate with others who have developed those skills, but my inclination is to create a prototype on my own or at least be able to describe it well enough that an engineer could understand me.

In a nutshell, here are the broad strokes of what I want to do:

Retrofit a Leica MDa with the guts of a compact APS-C digital camera (I would prefer to use a Sigma because I love the Foveon sensor). There are a host of problems associated with this, I know... firmware being the biggest one I can think of. 

Design a hardware based system for setting white balance. I imagine two dials on the rear of the camera, one for Blue - Yellow and one for Green / Magenta. The settings from those dials would have to be recorded in the metadata of the RAW file. Firmware again.

I want to create a readout that allows the user to see the color s/he has dialed in by shining colored light onto a neutral gray panel recessed in the camera body. The Leica MDa, since it was designed without a viewfinder, has plenty of room for this. The purpose of this design is to provide the user a method for quickly and accurately capturing his or her impression of color. It's important that the feedback from the camera be in the form of reflected light (as opposed to emitted light) because that's how we perceive light and color in the scene which we are photographing. Naturally this same window could be used to provide feedback on exposure. 

Aside from this window of colored light, the camera would not have a screen or viewfinder. One would have to rely on their mind's eye and an understanding of the lens in order to focus and compose. This is perhaps the most important aspect of the design: my intention is to create a camera that allows a user to stay fully engaged in the flow of time. Not only that, but that also demands an intuitive understanding of space - one would have to learn how to judge distance and field of view rather than relying on focus and compositional aids.

The experience I want to create for a user of this camera is one of a poetic, emotional, impressionistic approach to the act of photography. Once one masters the camera it will be possible to capture images that are technically superb and true to the unique perception of the user. 

TL;DR: I want to stuff a modern digital camera into a Leica MDa and develop a novel hardware / firmware interface.

I'm looking for some guidance and resources. What would help me to understand the hardware I will be working with? How about the firmware?

It seemed a simple problem, until we ended up with 6 different methods all giving different solutions.  I've idealized the situation below to make the math easy, but I'd really love to find out which way is most acceptable.

Setup:  15"" x 10"" steel foundation with 8 bolts.  The bolts are arranged into two rows along the long axis - 4 bolts on each side spaced 3"" apart.  The CG of the equipment is right in the center of the bolt group and 4"" above the bolt interface.  Here is a quick CAD drawing of the setup:  [FDN &amp; EQPT](http://i.imgur.com/DwRnSjn.png).

Method 1:  It was suggested to just create a couple and test the outermost bolts.  If the outermost bolts pass, then all bolts pass because this method is very conservative.

* Pe/nd = 10k * 4"" / 2 bolts * 9"" = **2.2k / bolt**

This method didn't meet acceptability.

Method 2:  It was then suggested to imagine the couple distance to be measured between the tension bolt group centroid and the compression bolt group centroid.  So, same method, but now we have 4 bolts in tension and compression on each side.

* Pe/nd = 10k * 4"" / 4 bolts * 6"" = **2.0k / bolt**

This method also did not meet acceptability.

Method 3:  M/S will gives stress.  Calculating Ixx, assuming 1/4"" bolts, Abt = 0.031 in^2 :

* Ixx = 4 * 0.031 in^2 ((1.5"")^2 + (4.5"")^2) = 2.79 in^4
* Sx = 2.79 in^4 / 4.5 in = 0.62 in^3
* Tensile stress per bolt = Pe/nS = 10k * 4""  / 2 bolts * 0.62 in^3 = 32.3ksi / bolt
* Tensile force per bolt = σAbt = 32.3ksi * 0.031 in^2 = **1.0k / bolt**

This did not meet acceptability, either!

Method 4:  On a whim, I decided to idealize the foundation as a beam with 4 pin supports.  The reactions of the pin supports should be the tensile force in each bolt plane.  Using a skyciv.com, I placed an applied moment of Pe = 10k * 4"" = 40k-in at midspan and pin supports as indicated in the drawing.  The [solution shown here](http://i.imgur.com/dPyJG0M.png) indicates the the innermost bolts will have the most tension force ±16.7k and the outermost bolts will have a tension force of ±1.1k.  Dividing the force by the number of bolts in the plane means the innermost bolts have a tensile force of **8.4k / bolt**.  This method didn't meet acceptability by far and I'm pretty sure, based on the reaction directions, this method is fundamentally flawed somehow.

Method 5:  The head engineer, tired of our incompetence, said, ""it doesn't rotate about the midpoint, it rotates about the edge!""  So, we did a neutral axis calculation and found the tension force assuming all 8 bolts are in tension.

* 2 * 0.003in^2 * ((3""-x) + (6""-x) + (9""-x) + (12""-x)) - 10"" * x * x/2 = 0
* x = 0.19""
* Ixx = 2 * 0.031 in^2 ((2.81"")^2 + (5.81"")^2 + (8.81"")^2 + (11.81"")^2 ) - 10"" * 0.19"" * (0.19"" / 2)^2 = 16.0 in^4
* Sx = 16.0 in^4 / 11.81"" = 1.4 in^3
* Tensile stress per bolt = Pe/nS = 10k * 4""  / 2 bolts * 1.4 in^3 = 14.3ksi / bolt
* Tensile force per bolt = σAbt = 14.3 ksi * 0.031 in^2 = **0.4k / bolt**

This **PASSED** acceptability.  This is what we went with for the check.

Method 6:  Later, I was researching this mess on my own and I found yet another method from (the message board claimed was) the ACI code.

* (Pe - righting moment) / nB = (10k * 4"" - 0.1k * 7.5 in) / 8 bolts * 15"" = **0.3k / bolt**.

This *really* passes for acceptability.  I showed my boss this method and he pointed out that they're just taking a generous couple distance and applying it to all bolts - a really non-conservative approach.

So, which method is right?  Is there a preferred method?  Is there a reference in the steel manual someone can point out?  Why is the alleged ACI method so non-conservative?  I'd appreciate any help or guidance on this matter.

One of the employees asked 
&gt;why do we have smart phones that have improved very quickly in recent years while cars have only gotten a little better over the last  100yrs. (Better as in miles to the gallon)

&amp;nbsp;

Now I'm not someone who knows the answer to this. But I do know:

1. This is a question of comparing two different techonlogies that came out of two different eras and 
2. I think its pretty rude to say that cars have improved very little over 100yrs. (have you seen a model T?)

&amp;nbsp;

 He continued on this idea with cars have not improved to give 100's of miles to the gallon because oil companies have stopped progression..

&amp;nbsp;

Now my question is this. Has their ever been a better engineered car engine, that was not used? If not, why can't we get 100's of miles to the gallon?

&amp;nbsp;

All I know is you can only get so much energy out of a combustion engine because most of it turns into heat.

I'm a mechanical engineer and I need help calculating some reactions on a load bearing wall. I'm pretty confident that I can perform a static analysis on the current condition of the walls and roof structure. I'm more concerned about making the proper assumptions, according to common construction practices, when designing the new condition. I want to accomplish a couple things and any help is greatly appreciated.

1. I want to appease my wife who is in the middle of ""remodeling"" our kitchen. She Googled ""Load Bearing Walls"" and most results returned some form of ""Consult an Engineer"". I'm an engineer so she consulted with me.
2. I want to correctly calculate the forces acting on the wall.
3. I want to transfer the forces calculated in #2 to the nearest load bearing wall.
4. I want to design a floor plan and construction plan.
5. I want to take said plan to a professional engineer to review.

Bottom Line: I want to do as much of the leg work as possible before consulting a professional engineer.

Questions:

1. How do you determine the weight of the roof? What types of assumptions are made? What types of margins of safety are commonly used?
2. When removing a retaining wall, Is it necessary to calculate the current condition or should I just move to the proposed design and determine those loads and have a wall(s) designed that can support the new loads properly?
3. What are the construction/engineering standards that govern these types of projects in California?

Thanks again for your help.

I've attached a small drawing to give you an idea of what I'm up against.

I have a small CNC milling machine that I am trying create a vacuum system for so I purchased a [Workshop WS0450VA Wet/Dry Vacuum](http://workshopvacs.emerson.com/shop/en/wsv/vacs-s-vacs-air-movers/vacs-s-at-home/45-gallon-50-peak-hp-contractor-wet-dry-vac-wsv-ws0450va) since wanted something somewhat portable. After running my first job I realized a huge oversight, the noise. The vacuum is loud (75-80db). After researching other shop vacs that might fit the requirements (&lt;65db, portable, wet/dry, under $200 and a connecting port for an exhaust hose) I realized that it isnt going to happen by buying one. So as a warranty voider, I dissassembled the vacuum and attempted [noise reducing adhesive backed foam](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811999222) that helped minimaly (1-2db). 

**My next idea is this:** 

Remove the fan from the shaft.

Cool the motor using PC fan, small blower, or inline fan that is significantly quieter 
by cutting a hole in the top of the housing with either a push or pull configuration.

Use the exhaust from the vacuum ducted through two 3/4"" Loc-Line tubes connected through a Y-reducer with 
the nozzles aimed at the cutting head to push debris into the Vacuum intake. This is so that I can more clearly see the cutting head as it removes material.

Add better and/or more sound dampening materials

**Possible issues I have thought of in my research are:**

Removing the fan will reduce the drag on the motor causing it to spin too fast. I planned on dealing with this by adding a [motor controller](http://www.harborfreight.com/router-speed-control-43060.html) to further reduce heat, noise and rpms.

I would like to manufacture a part similar in shape to this [toy helmet](http://1abxf1rh6g01lhm2riyrt55k.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/make-images/lqCDImU1XpVssYSj.jpg)  but much smaller. &amp;nbsp;



* It is intended to be a toy for display purposes only so it doesn't matter if it is hollow or solid
* It needs to be quite rigid
* It needs to have a hard shiny surface finish
* The size would be about the size of a fist then larger sizes could follow
* Manufacturing volume would be 100 to start then hopefully 1000's

I am trying to figure out which manufacturing techniques would be most cost effective. &amp;nbsp;


Possible manufacturing techniques I have looked at are :&amp;nbsp;


* Plastic injection molding - quite expensive to get the molds made although [http://www.protolabs.com/](http://www.protolabs.com/) might be able to do it quite cheap
* Blow molded plastic - cheaper molds than injection maybe as the pressures are lower?
* Vacuum molding - probably not suitable for this shape but a possible last resort solution.
* EPS Injection molding - not sure how the mold cost compares to plastic injection molding? [Not sure if this pumpkin is EPS injection molded?](http://www.craftmill.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/500x500/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/d/s/dscf0920_2.jpg)
* EPS Cnc machined [similar to this shape](http://www.foamlinx.com/eps_foam_machining_for_fiberglass_mold_plug.jpg), not sure of cost?
* EPS Hot wire cut - not sure if possible to get the shape I want, not sure how cost compares to other methods for mass production?

If it was made from EPS (polystyrene) then it would have to be coated with a hard finish which would add to the cost. &amp;nbsp;


If made from plastic then it could probably be done with a plastic which will automatically give the hard shiny finish I want. &amp;nbsp;



I'm an inventor in my spare time and have been trying to get something made for about 5 years, in that time I've learnt so much, but there is still so much to learn about manufacturing techniques, I'd really appreciate any advice from anyone on this subreddit as to how they would go about making it. &amp;nbsp;

It used a bubble of high pressure air to gain lift and float just over the surface of the water, enabling it to deliver its payloads at high speeds. One of the reasons it failed was due to turbulent air from the ocean surface disrupting the air bubble, thus causing unstable flight.

But I had a thought: assuming you drive over a relatively even and unchanging surface (roads), this turbulent air could be either reduced or, with modern control electronics, entirely eliminated and actively compensated for. This would change the limiting factors of efficiency and speed of the vehicle to one partly of aerodynamics, and partly of power/weight. Since there is no direct mechanical link from the engine to the road owing to the vehicle floating on a bubble of air, gas turbines would have to be used.

The form factor of the vehicle would be about as large as a heavy motorcycle. The basic idea is to have the turbine constantly turning at a high RPM, and using passing excess heat through a system of recuperators to preheat more incoming fuel, increasing thermal efficiency. The cold side of the recuperators, while still relatively warm, could have their air forced downward toward the pavement through the exhaust, thus generating the bubble of air to support the vehicle and its driver at a dead stop. Not only would this prevent aerodynamic stall at slow speeds, but it would be an increased safety factor: cars behind you need not worry about their front bumpers being melted off.

When moving forward at medium to high cruising speeds, aerodynamic surfaces on the bottom and sides of the vehicle would generate the vortices necessary for the bubble of air to remain under the vehicle and not collapse. The majority of thrust would then be forced out the back of the vehicle, providing forward movement. To handle deceleration, airbrake surfaces which flare outward in use can quickly bring the vehicle to a slower and safer speed, while control electronics redirect the exhaust to the vents under the recuperators. When parked, the vehicle's kickstand would extend downward from the bottom, such that the vehicle would be resting on them.

It has many practical applications. A state police officer could use one of these vehicles in hot pursuit of a fleeing criminal, while not running the risk of running over friendly spike strips. A paramedic could use it to rush to the scene of an accident and start treatment on the injured before the ambulance units arrive. A tourist could use the vehicle's blistering speed to quickly traverse vast stretches of open desert road.

I've found myself asking ""how do I become a good mechanical design engineer"", and after looking at related posts on this subreddit, I remained unsatisfied.  So I've made this post in a desire to get an answer to my question, and to serve as a resource to anyone else who finds themselves in my predicament. 

&amp;nbsp;

**The Problem**

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a recent MechE graduate (BS) who has always loved mechanical design, but has never really been every good at it.  Whenever I try to think of a solution, it's usually overly complex,  weird, and not very good,

I recently applied for a mechanical design position, and realized that not only are my mechanical design skills lacking, but understanding of other basic things such as GD&amp;T, recommended tolerance for parts in an assembly, manufacturing methods, etc are as well. 

I've always wanted to be a good designer, and with that in mind, I'm asking you, the engineers of reddit to help guide me and recommend ways I can overcome my apparent lack of talent.  

&amp;nbsp;


**The Solution, Part One: Things I Should Read**

&amp;nbsp;

Some quick research from the subreddit has told me I should read:

[""Geo-metrics III""](http://www.amazon.com/Geo-Metrics-III-Application-Dimensioning-Tolerancing/dp/0201633426/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1438222262&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=geometrics+iii) - for GD&amp;T

[""Machinery's Handbook""](http://www.amazon.com/Machinerys-Handbook-29th-Erik-Oberg/dp/083112900X) - for all things machining

""[Making it""](http://www.amazon.com/Making-Manufacturing-Techniques-Product-Design/dp/1856697495/) and  [""Manufacturing Processes for Design Professionals""](http://www.amazon.com/Making-Manufacturing-Techniques-Product-Design/dp/1856697495/) - for manufacturing related things


However, I really lack a knowledge of mechanical components beyond the basics like screws, bolts, gears, etc, so it'd be really helpful if you could recommend a mechanical version of something like [""Encyclopedia of Electronic Components""](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1118?gclid=Cj0KEQjw8-GtBRCMl7m54PzgjNQBEiQAIZckvzvqRy4BBvgB1-1fEo1G9FW0xMRaXqsihkdavqdYepMaArhg8P8HAQ)

I've also been reading [""The New Way Things Work""](http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Way-Things-Work/dp/0395938473) and it's been pretty helpful, but I'd love more recommendations on books or other resources that'll show me mechanical components and mechanisms in common applications. 

Other things I'd love resources or recommendations about would be ergonomic design, good resources for sketching, Design For Manufacturing (DFM), and anything else you can think of.

So I think this is just generally taking things apart, sketching and CADing them, and then reassemblying them to get a better intuition about mechanical components and mechanisms, a feel for the size/scale of things, and common mechanical failures.  I plan on using Craig's List as my source for free stuff, and hope to use whatever I can salvage as raw materials for DIY projects.

Feel free to recommend things I should take apart, good projects to try, etc.

&amp;nbsp; 

**The Solution, Part Three: The Unknown Unknowns**

Basically what else should I do to make myself for mechanically inclined?  What am I missing that you think would be helpful in this pursuit?  I'm open to all thoughts, questions, recommendations, and hope to make this a really enriching post for myself and others.

Thanks for reading!

I'm a machinist / programmer, and I'm looking to calculate a maximum ""safe"" speed at which to turn our raw material.

We're in the process of upgrading to some new inserts, which are designed for a surface speed of roughly 2x to 2.5x what we're running right now. For parts with small internal diameters, to reach that speed (1475sfm, 7.5m/s) we'll need way more RPM than I'm comfortable (or have experience) with... I'm also writing software that will assemble programs based off our Solidworks drawings (and each program needs a max spindle speed designated)... and to top it off, I'm a committee member on the OHSC, so I want to make sure I get the math right.

What is most likely to fail first as the RPM grows? The chuck jaws opening or deforming? The motor for the axis pushing the insert? The steel going all-in gumby style?

My gut feeling is that we'll be limited by the rigidity of our work-holding on long or thin-wall pieces (introducing chatter) long before anything failing becomes a concern (we're already nearing those limits on our longest / thinnest parts), but on our smaller/stockier/bulkier parts, we can hold the piece very well and the cutter happily dives in the faster we go (drying up all my courage before we hit even 60% of the chuck/machine ""maximum"").

The material is almost exclusively [1026 steel](http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6583), with the occasional [4140](http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6769), the chucks are [Kitagawa B210](http://www.kitagawaeurope.com/power-chucks/open-centre-chucks/b-200/b-210)'s, the machines are late-model small Okuma/Haas, and if I've not provided enough information, please let me know!

I was hoping the community could give me some perspective on my future plans and opportunities, since I feel like I am at a crossroads.

I have one semester left of school (US), so in December I will graduate with degrees in both Chemical Engineering and Paper Science Engineering.  I got recruited into paper mainly because I was offered a scholarship upon entering the ChE program if I did a dual major, and I like that it is a relatively green industry.  Since my paper program does a great job of getting students jobs, I have pretty much only worked in paper (three internships, one co-op, and one summer lab assistant position), though I did spend one summer after freshman year as an EH&amp;S intern for a pharmaceuticals company and the summer before my senior year of high school working for the EPA.  I have a good amount of experience, but working in paper mills has shown me that I really don't want to work as a process engineer; partly because I feel the culture/location of a mill/chemical plant will not suit me, and partly because the constant optimization and reliability work just doesn't get me jazzed.

Recently, I have been toying with the idea of going to grad school to make an impact in the renewable energy sector (solar, fuel cells, biofuels, etc.), or maybe green materials (e.g., plastics from cellulosic sugars); I want to help solve some of the world's problems, a la the Grand Challenges for Engineering.  From looking at jobs with some of these focuses online, it seems pretty much all of them require some type of graduate degree.

Most of the ""research"" work I have done so far has mostly just been working in the lab following someone's directions, so I have not really had the opportunity to lead a research project.  I intend to work for my adviser this coming semester on a project of his, but I am not sure if that will be enough research experience to prepare me for grad school.  I have a 4.0 GPA, so my adviser said I shouldn't have much trouble getting into a top grad school, but I have heard without research experience many grad schools will not even consider you.  

I think I want to work for a few years before I start grad school, though, to bolster my finances and make sure I am not worried about money while also devoting my time to research and/or rigorous coursework.  However, I really do not want to just take a job I will hate for a few years just to make some money.  Could I get any type of research job as an entry-level engineer to get my foot in the door, then progress once I have an MS or PhD?  I have not seen many jobs in the fields I am interested in that require less than a graduate degree (and/or several years of specialized experience), and even then I am sure the competition is fierce.

I'm not sure if I'm just worrying too much at this point, but soon it will be time for me to make a choice one way or the other.  I know I want to go to grad school, I am just not sure if I should go straight there, or if I will be able to find a job I could work and not hate with just a BS degree.

I recently graduated and got an amazing job, and am able to say I am a plant engineer at the age of 22, and I have recently been questioning if I am actually in an engineering position, or a tech with the name engineer in my title.  

In my internship my school required me to get, I got a spot at a small manufacturing plant near my home town in a little country town.  They only have a plant engineer there, and over the winter he left the position for something closer to home for him.  I was offered the position, and I hopped on it.  Our facility produces friction media, and all of the equipment is from the 50's and 60's, and the biggest part of my job is to keep the equipment running.  I am originally a mechanical engineer by degree, and I got a nuclear concentration, but I wanted nothing to do with the office and tie wearing life.  I work with electronics, hydraulics, thermal systems, mechanical systems, and lots of PLC's and control setups.

All of the maintenance personnel work under me and instead of just sending them out to a problem, I work with them, and that gets problems solved quicker.  I have heard from multiple area supervisors that they have never seen machines get put back online as quickly as I have gotten it done.  I make my own prototypes, I have my own tool box I roll everywhere in the facility to work on things, I make my own PLC programs, wire up my own equipment, and machine my own parts.  

The part that makes me think I might not be as much of an engineer is that I keep hearing from people at work that they have never seen an engineer as dirty as me, or that they have never seen one do what I do.  On top of that, every week I go see all of my friends I graduated with back in the city and get a beer and burgers after work and they are all dressed really nice, and are shocked at me in a wrangler shirt, or just tee shirt, dirty pants, and boots all covered in iron powder and graphite and they all think I'm a tech.  The projects I do are all very fast paced, I analyze everything I can to try and prevent future failures, and am trying to be able to do every job that people that work under me can do, as well as be a perfectly rounded man of the trade.

I've got a fluid system that utilizes an overflow weir to discharge any additional fluid entering the system.  In case of a system failure the overflow/discharge piping must be designed to handle the full load of the incoming fluids and I am afraid of under-sizing the overflow piping.  The inlet and outlet of the overflow piping are both open to atmosphere.  

Based on a system that pumps 2500 GPM of fluid at a speed of 6.7 ft/s, what other information do I need to gather to determine what size pipe is needed to effectively discharge all incoming fluids?  

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/sTQ1oB2.jpg) is a diagram of the fluid system and how the over flow works.  Based on the containers inlet flows and velocities, how would you determine the size of the pipe that is needed to be able to discharge all of the fluid, assuming the inlet and outlet of the discharge pipe are open to atmosphere. 


My fluid mechanics are not all that great and I think I may be overlooking something here.

------------------------

(In my [last post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3aux1o/1220_screw_thread_pushing_up_250_lbs_table_how/) I asked about the mechanism to raise and lower the table. I'm still waiting on some prices but I will prefer ACME threaded rod 1/2"" 10 TPI over normal screw 1/2""-20.)

For the legs, I want to use two square tubes, one inside the other as a guide. The inner tube will come out of the leg to change table height.

The problem I have is that some tube have a weld on the inside and that will probably mess with the action I'm trying to make.

I'm having a hard time finding how big of a bump this weld is.

At the metal place I can order from, there seem to be two square tubing 2""x2""x1/8"" that would be good for table legs.

They are at page 53 of the [linked pdf](http://www.russelmetals.com/en/Products/Documents/William_Bachcall_Russel_Stock%20List.pdf)

There aren't any picture and it doesn't specify what the difference is. I suppose one of them is made without a weld and the other with a weld ?

How big is the weld inside the tube ?

I suppose the structural steel tube is more expensive by a lot so I figure if I take a small size and weld flat bar inside the leg it will be just as good with the cheaper stuff ?

Like [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/N6qP5es.jpg)

------------------------------------------

My table has a target weight of 250 lbs and I'm hoping to keep the torque to raise it under 50 inch pounds (so I can drive them with car seat motors). Will these two configuration of telescoping leg have a significant difference in friction ?

-------------------------------------------

What kind of lubrication would work well for that kind of job ? I'm thinking of using [nickel-based anti-seize](http://www.amazon.com/Permatex-77124-Nickel-Anti-Seize-Lubricant/dp/B0002UENJ2) compound, re-applied yearly or maybe [something with molybdenum](http://www.amazon.com/Dow-Corning-Molykote-Grease-Lubricant/dp/B008ZGBXRU/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435457235&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=molycote) in it.

How significant is a PhD? I'm planning on getting my Masters, but have no desire to teach. I'm comfortable with the time commitment associated with getting a PhD, but if I don't land a research job I'm fearful I'll be stuck miserable in academia. Is a Master's degree acceptable or will I hit my ceiling early?

Does GPA matter beyond 3.5? I know for graduate school GPA is a large factor, but I don't know if labs are attracted to the 4.0's too. Industry seems to have a binary evaluation of ""above 3.0 or below 3.0"" - how is GPA evaluated for the labs?

How steady is employment that is based on funding? Being dependant on grants/legislation seems risky in my head, but I don't know how this pans out in reality. Are you ever in a situation where you're finding out in November if you'll have a job in January? I don't want to go to college for 8 years and end up in a field with no job security.

How busy is a typical week? In industry, deadlines affect profits so a sense of urgency is always present. While this can be stressful, the satisfaction of knowing you're doing real work and affecting consumers is fantastic. Is research similar? I don't know if a job requiring more theory means it's harder to see the fruits of labor, or if days are less demanding.

We have a number of steel drums containing some substances that have turned ""waxy"" after being left in ambient temp (say lowest 10degC). The customer wants to ""melt"" it all back to liquid using a heated box with forced convection up to 60degC i.e. delta T of 50 over 8-12hours.

I haven't included the energy required for latent heat between the semi-solid to liquid phase of the substance.

Have calculated that we'll need 600kJ to heat the air up, 740,000kJ to warm the substance up, and 7,000kJ to warm the drums up.

Total of approx 750MJ.

Over 8 hours, calculated to approx 26kW.

Will this be the heated element rating required? What sort of airflow should I be looking at?

Cheers


EDIT - After scratching my head and thinking back to thermofluids in University, the whole plethora of convection calculations are involved. i.e. heating the air to 60deg, which therefore needs to flow past the drums with SA of Xm^2, at a velocity of Xm/s to give us a convective transfer coefficient of h. Then there's the conduction through the metal wall of the drums, then finally conduction/convection to the semi-solid substance?

Is there any simplifications regarding the mixed conduction and natural convection, as well as the latent heat from solid-liquid of the substance to get it from the semi-solid state at 10deg to the liquid state at 60deg (unsure when the melt point is yet).

This heat transfer or ""loss"" in the air is then the amount of power we need to put in the system to maintain that transfer, therefore sizing our heating elements?",,,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,,,self,Heaterbox application - Thermofluid calculations,,,,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/38zg0a/heaterbox_application_thermofluid_calculations/,,,,,,,,1433737443.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,1394761434.0,{},{},

Total price $4.  =D

http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B007XQRKD4

http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00E9OGFLQ

I've not been able to find a circuit diagram for them both yet - still looking.

I've found the interference to be minimal, and hooked the PIR output to the Tx input pin.

I added an LED and 10k resistor to the data out of the Rx board, and the light would light briefly when the PIR went high.

BUT - I thought the Rx output would be high while the Tx is sending a signal, but it appears to only output when the signal appears and disappears.

Hence my need to oscillate the PIR's output into the Tx board.

That way, a constant square wave (10Hz, 50Hz, 500Hz?) will keep the Rx high.

I don't care about brief false Rx data from radio noise, the LED can flash like lightning for all I care - it's a SUPER CHEAP toilet engaged system. My instruction booklet would explain that the indicator needs to stay on for several seconds to show the toilet in use.

I know an MCU could cut out those false flashes, and produce a saw tooth Tx signal, but that's 2 MCU's at maybe $1 for both! (I've used ATTiny directly, TI's F2013's and Arduino platform.)

One main aim is to be ""Super cheap"".... so ANY extra wiring, resistor, or chip that's added has to really..... really be needed.

My dream oscillator would be something like a surface mount device, with three pins. Input and Power (1 pin), ground, output (square wave) at 20Hz.

Boss man flew out of the country for business instead of talking with me for a few minutes to settle things. 

Yesterday was the last day (to the date!) from when I started, but not a word from HR or boss man. Boss man didn't talk with much certainty when mentioning me continuing after internship was over during end-of-year review which could either mean I'm not doing well or just he's unsure whether I'm going to take off. 

It's pretty unprofessional to have someone report to an office without even knowing if they're getting paid for anything. Analogous to people walking in to apply for a job nowadays. Gut feeling and common sense tells me going back to the office despite not having signed anything is bad but I also don't want to cause a ruckus not showing up if everything is OK and they're just late in notifying how much I'm going to get paid. 

Other details, just completed major project that I've been working on for the past few months. Communication is a very sore spot and has been from what I hear from others but this is just some bs having me in limbo. 

I need and would greatly appreciate advice on immediate next steps for next few days as I'm going in to maybe figure out what the hell is going on, best case scenario negotiating salary, and also worse case scenario I get dumped and need to get compensated for extra day(s) went into office to include on top of unused vacation time and anything else that could be done along those lines. 

And also in conjunction with worst case scenario good places/websites to look for entry level engineer position as I'll probably have to change industries if dumped.

Could it work to build a trainset that filled up the entire tube, where cars were weighted at the bottom and free to swivel/rotate as they banked around curves?

My main goal is to work for one of the big tech companies like Google, Apple, Intel, etc.. on electronic devices (iPhone, iWatch, iPad, Macbooks)..but most positions at Apple related to this require a Masters or Ph.D. So, now I am considering to learn Apple's new programming language ""Swift"" and become a programmer instead. 
I am deciding to switch because in college I had to decide between Materials Science or Computer Science. I went with Computer Science. Now, I want to learn programming on the side while working full-time to develop skills using the new langauge ""Swift"".

My question is:
Is it a big disadvantage for me as a Materials Science major to apply for a Computer Science position? How do I stand out?

-My solution is to learn Swift and publish some apps to the App Store and put on my resume

Will that get me anywhere?

I'm looking at a system where I'm pumping water(sewage) out into the ocean. The system goes: pump ---&gt; tank ---&gt; pipe ---&gt; ocean. The water in the tank has the same elevation as the ocean. If the pump suddenly stops(f.ex. loss of electricity), the water in the pipe still has some momentum and some of the water will still leave the pipe and go into the ocean(thus lowering the water level in the tank). That will make a difference in water levels between the tank and the ocean as there is water leaving the tank through the pipe but not coming in. The pressure from the ocean would then force a backflow into the tank.

How do I calculate how much water leaves the pipe? I know the diameter of the pipe and water velocity in the pipe(when the pump is running). How quickly does the water in the pipe go from v=1,2 m/s to v=0 m/s?

I've tried searching but all the information I find is about water hammer and what happens downstream in the pipe when a pump is shut down or valves closed, I'm having a really hard time finding anything about water leaving pipes with momentum only.

I've tried this: http://excelcalculations.blogspot.com/2011/12/dynamic-liquid-flow-between-coupled.html method but it is missing the factor that the water is already flowing with some velocity and momentum in one direction.

&gt;The damage would be staggering.
&gt;
&gt;New York City (I'm guessing you mean the city, not the entire state), last experienced a big earthquake, and it was only 5.5 mind you, back in the 1800's . This was long before there were tall buildings within it. New York is not in a area prone to earthquakes bigger than that, but never say never.
&gt;
&gt;What would suffer the most would be old ""Brownstone"" constructions made of brick. They are strong against pressures pushing ""down"" on them (the weight of the floors above them) but very, very bad against lateral (sideways) movements. Imagine a stack of Jenga blocks. Push down from above, and they are pretty strong. Push the tower from the side though and....crash.
&gt;
&gt;Modern skyscrapers built with steel are better at resisting earthquakes, but the building code requirements in NYC do not require new buildings to withstand earthquakes the way a skyscraper in say San Francisco or Tokyo do. A level 8 earthquake like the one that hit Nepal would probably flatten most of the city, with loss of lives in the hundreds of thousands or possibly even millions if it hit in the middle of the day during a weekday, when the city is most populated with people working there.
&gt;
&gt;It would be bad, let's just say that.

I have a couple of ideas, and I'd really appreciate it if someone could let me know what they think.  
First idea, I could use a DPDT relay, have the 12V battery's positive connected to Pole 1's terminal, negative on Pole 2's terminal, and have the output positive/negative feed on the Throw 1's terminals, reverse them on Throw 2's terminals. These would connect to the pump. (Please correct me if I have the terminology messed up there) I'd then have the audrino control the Relay's switching terminal at 50/60 times per second. I assume that this would produce a triangle wave, but I'm not sure if the motor would be happy with that.  
Second idea, look for some magic IC that can convert DC to AC without any unnecessary stepping-up of the voltage.

I have an interesting request from a utility operator in Western Australia that we measure the DC current contribution that our newly installed inverters feed into the grid while exporting. 

We are allowed to contribute no more than 0.5 percent of the total rated inverter current as DC. (System total current will be in the order of 100's of amps)
Now obviously it is pretty easy to measure the DC offset/bias of an AC voltage with most multi-meters or even if you want to get really technical, an oscilloscope.

However to measure the DC offset of an AC waveform in a 90A/415V circuit is a little bit harder. 
A standard hall effect or clamp meter ranged for the correct AC current will be wildly inaccurate when trying to measure values to the order of 200mA DC per phase or less, but the thought of trying to design and install a shunt for series metering on an installation of this size is a bit terrifying. If I get it wrong I could cause a major fire in the switchboard or worse.

If you have any suggestions on how I can measure 200mA of DC in a 415V 200A AC circuit without dying, that would be wonderfully received!

Smaller bulb wrapping seems like the obvious answer, however we run at fairly fast air flows (15-40 m/s), moderate dry temps (100 - 250 deg. C), and highish humidity (up to 40 % vol.)... Small bulb will dry out quickly and make it easy to miss the plateau!

It is in a bottle with say 600cm^2 surface area. I take it out to room temperature at 25Deg. The glass is 7mm thick.  Assuming wine has a heat capacity of water how long will it take for the bottle to reach 15Deg C.

from what i can understand  I need to find the average heat transfer in watts at the temperature difference and with the given surface area and thickness by:

Rate = k•A•(T1 - T2)/d


K= rate constant for the material;  A = Surf Area;  d = thickness
gives us the rate in W.

Then relate the heat transfer to the specific heat capacity of water
Q=mc dT

which gives us the total energy difference needed in J.

since W = J/s this would give us the time needed?

Is this the way to do it or my basic physics classes were too simplistic?

I graduated with a BS in electrical back in December, and my job search has ripened. I have three potentially very interesting situations. One is a company that is actually flying me in for an in person interview next week. Another is a company that was very encouraged by my phone interview last week, to where the hiring manager sent me a technical test to determine 'how much he has to train me' (paraphrasing, but I think important). The third situation is a government job, and I had a phone interview where the interviewer suggested an offer would be forthcoming in a couple of weeks (though of course nothing is guaranteed).

Company 1 is one of the largest public companies in the world and from what I understand an offer may follow while I am on site after I finish the interview and tour of their facility. The engineering involved is generalized but they do require electricals. Company 2 is a private company that is highly specialized and has potentially higher initial compensation due to the specialization required (which I have some experience in due to classes in school). I haven't heard yet back after sending in the technical assessment earlier this week but I expect to hear from them either tomorrow or early next week. And the last is the government job which I explained above.

I don't want to sour any of them from considering me, but I would like for company 2 to sort of move along in their decision if they want me to come in for an in person interview since the clock is probably going to start ticking on company 1 as soon as I finish my interview with them. Nothing is guaranteed but from my research I should be highly encouraged with company 1's commitment thus far.

I don't have exact numbers or specific benefits from any except the government job (due to public disclosure and all) but I'm looking for advice on how to manage this from more experienced engineers. I'd like the opportunity to see company 2 in person before I commit to anything.

I was thinking that I should let company 2 know that I'm going to be flying for a job interview soon. I don't think I should specify the company that I'd be interviewing with, but my thinking is that with the information that I'm in demand that they'll come to a decision faster on whether or not to have me come in person as well. I don't know how long I could delay in accepting an offer from company 1 in order to hear from company 2, and I'm ready to start my career and my real adult life.

EDIT: I just realized I should probably be a little more specific. All are locating in the US and I'd have to relocate for any of them.

I need a flow rate out of the accumulator of about 10k CFM, so I have no idea how realistic that is.

Can someone smarter than me tell me if this is possible in a package that meets the above limits and fits in a package not larger than 30""x20""x12""?

Edit: thanks for the replies everyone - I'm convinced now that my scheme won't work, largely based on the fact that the continuous flow would require an enormous compressor and similarly enormous amount of power to run it.  I suppose I'll go back to the fan/cowl idea!

I'm not sure how tube-clamps differ from a welded connection so I modeled it in SolidWorks and ran some simulations. I assumed a 500N inward horizontal force on both members, but that's a figure I just pulled out of my ass. I'll be using 26.9mm aluminum tubes with a 2.5mm wall thickness and these tubeclamps:

&amp;nbsp;

I was looking at a possible career change and was wondering what you think about this, especially you with defense industry XP. **TL;DR @ END**

&amp;nbsp;

**Info about me**: 

* Ohioan, BSEE recent grad of 14' here, No debt, interested in Space / Defense Systems Simulators, Testing Hardware, Drones or Systems work long-term (Think hush hush NASA, SpaceX, Lockmart, Booz, 3 letter agency, Boeing, or other places that do cunning edge things that help the good guys) 
 
* Previous experience: Solid State Lighting, Cyber security, Lab Background work with GPS, Accelerometers and Gyroscopes, made an autonomous robot to navigate a maze. Active ""L"" Clearance for nuke work 

* Never got into any trouble or done anything stupid / regrettable in my life. (for clearance purposes) -- Really wanted to join the military after HS to serve, but instead went to college to become an EE (enjoyed it too!). My family has a lot of Vets in it, we take pride in those who serve. Very ""Murka!"" mentality.

&amp;nbsp;

I am currently a new **Nuclear Engineer** tasked with learning turbine systems and eventually seeing a new Digital control system upgrade. The work here is very regulated and everything is by-the-book. As an engineer, I am not allowed to touch any of the systems physically, so I have to have the maintenance department do all the hands-on work due to union agreements, this kind of bothers me as it is my system and I would like to help too. The work is like a sine wave, some days its a hectic mess, other days it is smooth sailing. 

&amp;nbsp;

**About the current job**

&amp;nbsp;

**Older engineers have recently warned me** that the company uses and abuses engineers at our plant. The engineers even tried to unionize a few years back because of this. *(calling them in during days off, not paying them during forced outages, making you give 5 hours over-time for free, and not paying you overtime rates 1.5x ~ 2x your rates that maintenance and electrical techs (unionized) get paid when coming in for overtime)* Basically, because they are unionized I can easily state that Electrical Techs make more than engineers, have better hours, and are treated better here than the engineers that are incharge of them (and they let you know when they are pulling $90/hour days and your not) Odd to have an older engineer say that he lost a ton of family time and personal time without getting paid in order to keep his job.. I like the job, my co-workers are funny, its cool to put on my hard hat and go out in the field and actually see things working, and the cost of living in the area is pretty decent. I just wish I wasn't working with ancient legacy systems *(cunning edge 70s tech)*, a company that doesn't want to properly fund repairs or fix things the way the engineers suggest, they would rather do cheap and easy, or bury under papers and forget.

&amp;nbsp;

**Nuke Engineer**

&amp;nbsp;

**Pluses**: 

* Steady Work

* 60k Sal

* New DCS system sometime in the future

* Power Company = Job Stability / Security?

* Co-workers are funny and enjoyable

* Boss is from the interwebs, older but gets funny references

* Closeish to city I grew up in / went to college in.

* Cheap cost of living in the area

* Around a rural, lake area, I love paintball, hiking and want to do SCUBA

* Nuclear jokes and stories to tell friends

* Every day is different, from water gushing out of a boiler to filling out paper work to OMG!!! FREE LUNCH TODAY!!!!! :D

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons**: 

* Very Regulated by the book work.

* Older engineers warning me about the company.

* Cant touch my systems! :(

* Have to give 5 free hours of overtime

* Never can get OT unless approved

* Techs make more than engineers (Sometimes $1k Days and have better hours)

* Outages - 6 days a week , 12 hour days for usually 2 months, you give them 5 free hours OT, rest is paid normal rate, not OT like the techs / maintenance / ops / electricians,

* Ancient tech, like microfilms, tape reels, DOS, and punch cards.. AND WE KEEP USING THEM =...(

* Toilets are abysmal here - I believe Low flow toilets from the 80s waste more man hours each year than World of Warcraft.

* Friends wont stop talking about Homer Simpson / Radioactive song -_-

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Experiences Trying to get in the Space / Defense Industry**

&amp;nbsp;

The other opportunities I have been pursuing are in the Defense and Space industry. I recently interviewed with Lockmart about 4 weeks ago and was impressed with the things they described. Unfortunately they have not contacted me back, despite my emails. Before working at the nuke plant I talked / interviewed w/ Boeing, but they called and said they took a candidate who had a TS/SCI poly - clearance over me (probably saves them money).

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Other thoughts on it**

&amp;nbsp;

Now, hear me out, I have been shot-gunning some job apps blindly to some of the big firms and recently have been talking to one that starts with ""Booz"". They said they cant hire on a full-timer who doesn't have a active TS SCI clearance / isn't already clearable, so a recruiter is asking if I would be interested in a summer-fall internship so that I can get a TS SCI. It talks about software development, analysis, some programming with problem solving and application. I can program, but I am by no means a CE or CS. I can do Scripting and Batch files pretty easily, but I am sure a CE/S would cry if they saw my technique.. (My code = if,else,if,else...) But I am interested in the work, depending on what it is and also the TS, because I see that as a stepping stone to get in the industry I am interested in going into. But my thing is that it is an internship.. and well, I just don't know. Aside from joining the military, this maybe one of the better ways to get a clearance and some experience.

&amp;nbsp;

**Booz Internship - Engineering Prototype unknown opportunity**

&amp;nbsp;

**Pros**:

* Industry I am interested in!

* Clearance for more opportunities in that industry!

* Title sounds interesting with ""prototype"" in it? = new tech?

* Maybe better hours?

* Better bathrooms?

* Working with the industry that helps defend our country! 

* Develop cool things you wont see publically in years maybe?

* I think its nice for them to offer me this / think about me to get cleared!

* Better pay in the future?

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons**:

* Its an internship, after college

* Unknown - But probably going to have to move to an urban area that I cant paintball in or SCUBA in.

* Unknown - Probably less pay at first, until cleared to a real position - Intern

* Unknown - Coding? - Not the best at it, but I can do it! :)

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR**: Work at a nuke plant now, its steady work, we are upgrading to a new system some year or another.. But I like the idea of working as an engineer in the Space / Defense industry. - I was Previously rejected for other candidates with active clearances in the Space / Def Industry - In my head its a way of serving and also working with the technology I am interested in. I am in the initial stages of getting offered an internship to get cleared, but I question risking and giving up what I have now to become an intern. Follow a dream of eventually working with Defense / Space? Or is the dream already right in front of me / is a lie / there is no spoon?

&amp;nbsp;

**Long Term goals**:

&amp;nbsp;

Long term I want to first be an engineer who either works with new hush hush tech or Simulators for Defense / Space applications (think plane / helo / war game sims) and/or stuff you'll see in years after it declassifies (think lithium battery), and help bring about new ideas to the table! :) Later I would like to be in charge of a group of new engineers and help them do their tasks / lead some people

To validate it, I was trying to compare how the angle of attack changes over time versus the jeffrey orbital.

T (the period in seconds) = 2*pi*(aspect ratio + 1/(aspect ratio)) /(shear rate)= 2*pi*3.333/(shear rate)

Im following this [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250903002148) (specifically eq 25) and I get good results but I'm not sure if they're correct and I'm misinterpretting them or I'm just wrong.

So what is happening is this:

My shear rate is let's say 10 1/s and my vorticity is 10 1/s from the fluid flow simulation.

But then, when I do the angular velocity, I get: angular velocity = 10/2 = 5.  This makes sense to me because my torque is proportional to (.5*vorticity-angular velocity).  And so that makes sense to me since I*d(omega)/dt ~ constant*(.5*vorticity-angular velocity)^2

And so, if my angular velocity = 5, the cylinder will make a 360 degree revolution in 2*pi/(10/2)=2*pi*2/10 but the jeffrey orbital says I should be getting 2*pi*3.333/10.

So you can see the difference is a factor of 3.333/2.  Any thoughts?  Am I interpretting this wrong or did I set up my model wrong?

I don't have much knowledge in this area, but I would bet that for an application that requires good resistance to impact, concrete would not be a choice material. 

As far as I understand the properties of concrete that make it unfavorable are its hardness and brittleness. When subject to impact, concrete won't deform much since its hard, thus cannot dissipate the energy and will fracture because its brittle. I suppose this means it has a low toughness, since a small deformation causes fracture.

How does the strain-rate effect the fracture? An impact load would cause a very high strain rate, so that makes me wonder if different materials (or concrete mixes) can deform at different rates? For example, a load of magnitude 'x' applied gradually may not crack concrete, however if applied (almost) instantaneously it could. Is this because the material can dissipate energy (by deforming) at a rate equal to the energy being applied to it, and if the material deformation can keep pace it begins to fracture? I have learned that strain rates from impact can be on very different time scales (in civil applications), ex: 10E-6 to 10E-5/s for vehicle collision to 5x10E-2 to 10/s for aircraft landings.

I was wondering if anyone could provide a few (not necessarily civil) applications where impact resistance is an important parameter, the materials commonly used in those applications, and a simplified explanation of the properties that make those materials ideal. I'm trying to look at things from a different perspective, since impact resistance of concrete is usually a more 'secondary' design parameter due to impacts often being a result of an accident - so any resistance to that impact is kind of a bonus.",,,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,,,default,Performance of materials subject to impact,,,,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/2ylhen/performance_of_materials_subject_to_impact/,,,,,,,,1426041601.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,{},{},

It strikes me that the delta-v from LEO to GEO would be cheaper per km/s since you aren't fighting the atmosphere.

I'm active in 4 clubs, many of which I've won awards for. I'm definitely not trying to brag but my point is, I have the credentials needed on paper to get into a selective engineering program. 

However, I chose the field of engineering as a future career path very recently. I have always been talented in all subjects (taking AP Calculus BC as a junior) but felt most attracted to public speaking/people managing sorts of things (politics, business). I recently realized through some engineering classes at my school that not only does it make use of my mathematical inclination, engineering is actually a very fun and productive use of my need to be creatively challenged. 

All that being said, I'm a high school junior looking at the engineering programs of colleges like UC Berkeley with very little actual engineering experience. I want to show colleges that I can take initiative and pursue engineering outside of my public education, because currently who I am on paper does not show my newfound interest in engineering. I've tried getting how to books but I don't even know where to start. There's so much I don't know about how things work that it would take years for me to try to attempt any project I've thought of in the past (a holographic keyboard was one I was particularly stuck on). 

Any ideas or even college advice would be very useful! I hope this is the right thread for my question.

Very glad this subreddit exists! I'm hoping I can leverage your knowledge and expertise for a startup I am working on.

Essentially we are trying to make 3D printing more affordable for the average person who does not own a 3D printer. We're just validating assumptions right now and trying to determine who exactly our target market is and which groups we can provide real value to. As engineers I imagine you use addictive manufacturing for many of your prototyping needs, and I'm curious if our value prop would resonate with you.

Would you use a platform that allowed you to upload your CAD/STL file to a semi-private job board so 3D printing studios could bid and compete for your business? We're also encouraging independent owners of 3D printers to come on board to print and ship basic models, but at a much lower cost than a professional printing hub would charge.

I've been using this survey for other groups, although I'm not sure if this community is the best spot for it. It's here if you would like to participate:

Any feedback from this group would be extremely valuable to me and I very much appreciate any comments or criticism you might have. We have a lot of learning to do, but I'm hoping our assumptions are at least half correct.

In the 60's the Army Corps extended a locally-built breakwater to protect the boat cranes and equipment from southern storms, but in so doing the breakwater prevented sand from migrating along the coast. The resulting siltation fills in the boat launch area every few years, requiring regular expensive dredging. [a better encapsulation of the problem at Port Orford is here](http://orsolutions.org/osproject/port-orford)

This type of problem seems to be a fairly common byproduct of breakwater construction, with the other side of the coin being erosion. There is a port in Chiapas, Mexico where the town on the other side of a perpendicular breakwater has been literally washing away from erosion, and to combat it they're dropping enormous boulders on what used to be an important tourism beach. 

It got me thinking: is there some way to dissipate coastal wave energy while allowing sand to continue its lateral migration? What if your breakwater looked like a long, 20-ft tall triangular prism with a 5-10 foot gap at seafloor level (let's assume the ocean is 12-feet deep or so) to allow water to pass underneath while making the surface-level waves climb a triangular slope? Alternatively, what if current breakwater designs were built on a row of those concrete highway culverts to allow water to pass under?

I'm working on the trading floor of a midstream oil &amp; gas company right now (dealing with LPG's specifically) and I want to get more acquainted with the processes that take place within Oil Refineries. I'm finding that it's a lot easier for me to understand the markets when I know a little bit more about what's actually happening at Oil Refineries and why there's suddenly more supply or demand of certain products when certain units are brought up or brought down. With that said, I'm not completely foreign to how refineries operate. I've done some pretty good research into the main processes and units but I still feel that I want to know more. I've got a list of questions below that I've separated out by each unit/process at the refinery. If you can shed any light on my questions or correct any wrong thoughts I have I'm all ears! Even if you've got some information that's tangent to one of the questions and not completely relevant I will still welcome it with open arms! I'm not looking for specifics on any one refinery, just information in general (if that's possible):

**Distillation Processes**

- Does a typical complex refinery have more than one main crude unit? If so, how many might a refinery have? I'm not talking about fractionation columns in conjunction with other units, just the main one(s) at the beginning of the refining process
- How much tolerance is there in terms of being able to change cut points on the crude unit? I realize that this depends on geographical location as well as the capabilities of the refinery, but let's assume that we're talking about a refinery that's got all the bells and whistles
- What options do refiners have if the crude unit goes offline? Would this severely restrict the refinery from operating? How can a refiner overcome a problem like this?

**Reforming Processes**

- I know there's multiple purposes for catalytic reformers, but I'm still not entirely sure how the unit operates. Are the conversions accomplished over several different reactors that are collectively referred to as the ""catalytic reformer""? Is there really just one reformer that can accomplish multiple conversions?
- How many different catalysts might be used in a reformer? I know that in the isomerization reactions expensive catalysts like Platinum or Rhenium are used. How are those protected from getting degraded? Don't the C6+ portions of the feed to the reformer destroy those catalysts?
- What type of flexibility can the reformers have? How heavy can the feedstocks to a reformer get before they have to be processed elsewhere? C8? C9+?

**Fluid Catalytic Cracking**

- How big can FCC units get? I know that they're significant proportions of the total capacity of the refinery but what's the max capacity for them relative to the throughput of the refinery? Will the size be dependent on whether or not a refinery is optimized to produce gasoline or a different product?
- What happens when the FCC goes down? I'm struggling to see how a refinery can still operate efficiently without the use of their FCC

**Alkylation**

- What's the optimal ratio for olefins to iso-butane in the reactor? I know this will depend on the type of unit but is there a general guideline to this?
- Does either an HF Alky or SA Alky perform better when using certain combinations of butylenes and propylenes?
- What happens to alkylation if the FCC is not in operation? How are olefin feedstocks acquired?

**Coking**

- I'm still not quite sure why coking exists. Is the reason for coking to produce more light end products? Or does coking exist for the purpose of being able to sell the heaviest ends for more? Both?
- If the FCC unit goes down can the coker serve somewhat as a substitute unit? Since coking is just severe thermal cracking are some of the same results achieved? Or is too much cracking achieved?

Like I said earlier, I will definitely have more questions the more we dive into these topics, so these are just some starter questions to get this discussion going.

I am planning to put a 7/16 osb roof on with normal tar paper and shingles. Will these two posts have enough strength to support the roof or do I need to install a third post in the center of the two posts?

So question is will the 2x6 board spanning the 16 ft between posts be strong enough to support the 2x4s(16in apart OC) or should the board be upgraded to a 2x8? or should I add the third post in the middle and upgrade the 2x6 board to a 2x8 across the posts?

I see the controllers that are currently available for astronomical amounts as a very specific thing.  I never really like my tools' uses to be so set in stone.  I want this research to inform other things (like a wireless follow focus that uses the same microcontroller with the same inputs as the wheels controller).

Backstory:

When my dream of this stuff started, I was attempting to build a pan/tilt head that was controlled by an Arduino.  At that stage, the pan/tilt head would have looked like [this](http://www.mrmoco.com/34/) ideally.  Another photo of the [Mark Richards Moco one](http://monster-remotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SFH-30-pic.jpg)  

I wanted to be able to sit with the director and use my pan/tilt head as the Libra head has done for years (with [military-grade technology](http://procamrentals.com/wp-content/gallery/libra-head/162-6210_img.jpg)).

Now, however, the designs for pan/tilt heads have changed.  There was a German forum where the [brushless gimbal revolution](http://www.simplebgc.com/) started and it has changed my ideas (and most people's) of the design for the pan tilt head.  Stabilization, being something that the head's hardware takes care of, is one of the main benefits that has me convinced that it is superior to [this design](http://monster-remotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SFH-30-pic.jpg).

____________________________________________

Anyway, being at the very start of this project, my initial research hinges on these two pieces of hardware (that I need YOUR help deciding on):


1. what high-resolution rotary encoder is in [this](http://shop.kids-of-all-ages.de/video/brushless-gimbal/hurricane-wheels/hurricane-wheels-brushless-gimbal-rc-interfacebox-bundle-preorder-only) device?  *The upper limit of my budget is around $550 for each encoder.*  It looks like my ideal encoders will be generating something like 180,000 steps per minute or 180RPM. 

2. what micro-controller should I buy if I want:


- MOST IMPORTANT: real-time, high resolution read of 4 simultaneous high resolution encoders 
- less critical read of around 8 pots or lower resolution rotary encoders (perhaps would require a multiplexer??)
- Bluetooth 4.0 communication of all values in as close to real-time  as possible into a receiver device (another arduino or a teensy 3.0??) that sends control signals to a few motor drivers

_______________________________________________

Currently, my research is learning toward the 32 bit Arduino Due for receiving the data from the encoders.  Are the pin interrupts fast enough to get real-time positional data of 4 high resolution rotary encoders or what?  Should I go with something faster?  If so, what kind of speed will I need from the pin interrupts?
____________________________________________

*Any advice at all would be much appreciated.  I have run into a brick wall because I don't want to buy hardware that is going to be obsolete or unsupported at a later date when I want better performance or specs.*  

The reason it needs to be modular is that I want the libraries that work for this device to also work for a device like [this wireless follow focus device](http://www.prestoncinema.com/products_FIZ-HU3_2014.html).  There is no reason a decent wireless follow focus should cost around $9,000 in 2015.    These devices are all doing a very similar task: transmitting rotational data wirelessly to control a motor.

Just a heads up: The motor controllers and motors are already sort of set in stone, so I don't need any advice on the motor end of this project.  

* The pan/tilt head will be [THIS one](http://www.came-tv.com/came8000-3-axis-gimbal-for-lots-of-different-size-camera-p-566.html), which receives a standard Spektrum RC signal

* The wireless follow focus will be [THIS](http://store.redrockmicro.com/microremote.html) and my device will replace the controller that is pictured, though I'll still keep the original, obviously.  

This is a problem that a community should be solving instead of a bunch of profiteers hoarding their expertise. 


I want to give this device to the community.  I am not in this for profit at all.  I just want this tool (as a filmmaker).  

While I understand the reason for closing your source, when the people who already make this stuff (and put the price into the stratosphere) pocket their IP, they do themselves a disservice.  An open source community has a way of working out the bugs and empowering people to go further than the inventor ever imagined.  It also blazes a path for future innovation.

Edit 1 (updates):
Upon discussing it with a few manufacturers of rotary encoders, it's becoming obvious that perhaps the original Hurricane Wheels don't actually utilize absolute rotary encoders and most likely instead use incremental ones.  The latency of the absolute encoders bottom out at around 100 m/s and the latency I am pushing for is around 20-40 m/s from wheel turn to motor turn.  The incremental ones are rock solid up to around 800-1000 RPM and my needs are aroud 180 RPM.

__________________________________________
Backstory: 

I am at the **very start** of building something very close to [this controller](http://www.paralinx.net/store/hurricane-wheels-3-axis-brushless-gimbal-controller-system) device.  I am in the hardware spec phase, I guess you could say.  

I love the idea of a modular set of rotary encoders.  I have been thinking about it for around 10 years and I just don't think it would/should cost $4,000 dollars to get pan/tilt control of a head wirelessly.     

When my dream of this stuff started, I was attempting to build a pan/tilt head that was controlled by an Arduino.  At that stage, the pan/tilt head would have looked like [this](http://www.mrmoco.com/34/) ideally.  Another photo of the [Mark Richards Moco one](http://monster-remotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SFH-30-pic.jpg)  

I wanted to be able to sit with the director and use my pan/tilt head as the Libra head has done for years (with [military-grade technology](http://procamrentals.com/wp-content/gallery/libra-head/162-6210_img.jpg)).

Now, however, the designs for pan/tilt heads have changed.  There was a German forum where the [brushless gimbal revolution](http://sourceforge.net/projects/brushless-gimbal-brugi/) started and it has changed my ideas (and most people's) of the design for the pan tilt head.  Stabilization, being something that the head's hardware takes care of, is one of the main benefits that has me convinced that it is superior to [this design](http://monster-remotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SFH-30-pic.jpg).  

Companies like Freefly capitalized on the craze by making their device ready for professional productions.

The home was built in 1992.  I was going to mount a TV on the wall and found to my surprise/disappointment/worry that the studs are 24"" O.C. instead of [16"" O.C. as are called for in the plans](http://i.imgur.com/DzjYInk.jpg).  

It could be that I am reading the plans wrong, but I read that it says ""2x4  @ 16"" OC.""  I could think of two reasons why the studs are at 24"" O.C:  a) to save money and time by a cheap builder or b) a mistake because it also says in the wall details something about sheathing being 24"" O.C. (I don't know what that means).  

[I read an article](http://www.builderonline.com/building/dear-builders-engineer-studs-at-24-inch-spacing_o) that 24"" OC 2x4 studs can be ok for ceiling less than 9 feet and moderate to low wind/snow loads.   But we have ceilings higher than this (vaulted ceilings with exterior walls in excess of 12 ft) .  The house is located in Fort Collins, CO, so wind and snow loading could be significant (I haven't checked ASCE 7 to see).

My question is:  Is my home built incorrectly?  And is it structurally sound or could it collapse during a significant loading event (tornado, high snow)?  It has been standing for over 20 years.

I can upload the complete plans if desired.  (I'm a mechanical engineer with experience understanding wind loads, snow loads, etc.. so feel free to get technical if you like)

Thanks for the help my fellow engineers (and contractors/builders)!

EDIT: I further looked and saw that the floor joists are 16"" OC like in the plans. I also looked that the studs in the un-finished parts of the house (basement and garage) are 16"" OC, as if the builder was trying to hide something.  
The studs are not 2X6's.

Not really what I had in mind, but I thought it could be a great experience since they do all their design work, most of their manufacturing, and even some R&amp;D in-house. They do a lot of plastic injection molding, and they make some of their molds on a 4-axis CNC which is a process I’d really like to learn about in detail.

I am now about 5 months in and I often thing about quitting. I’ve done very little work that I would call ‘engineering’, and most days I do 8 hours of assembly-line tasks. Sometimes it seems as though they don’t even need any additional engineers (they have an M.E. and an E.E. who have both been there a while before I was hired). They’re paying me very little ($15/hr), but I’m giving them the benefit of the doubt and attributing that to the fact that I’m still a temp worker (I should make the transition to permanent around the 6 month mark). Regardless, I can’t help but feel like they’re wasting my skills and my time, I know there are other companies out there that would hire me and pay me a reasonable engineer’s salary for doing an actual engineer’s work.

I’ll likely stay there at least until the 6 month mark. At that point, I’m told I’ll receive a raise and benefits. I’m somewhat doubtful the raise will be satisfactory, and I’m fairly certain I’ll still be spending much of my time doing assembly line tasks. It also would not surprise me if I didn’t even get a raise at this point; they don’t tell me much. I have a second job as a Lyft driver in San Francisco, and I make a lot more money doing that, so sometimes I wonder if I should quit my microphone job so I’ll have more time for job hunting and Lyft driving.

I’m always on the lookout for a new job, but I’m not having much luck. I got my current job because a recruiter saw my resume on careerbuilder.com, so I’m inclined to upload the latest version (on LinkedIn as well) and see what comes from that. I’ve given up applying online through job searching websites, nobody ever replies. I think I’d be better off speaking to someone face-to-face. I’ve been trying to find resources online pertaining to places I could go, and so far I’ve found eventbrite.com, Lemnos Labs, and a couple other startup incubators, as well as ASME. Any advice on finding companies or events that I could physically go to and speak with (or any job searching advice / stories) would be appreciated.

I think my resume is pretty good, considering my lack of work experience, but oh how I hate writing cover letters.

I’ve seen a few people post on Reddit saying that if someone finds them a job, they will pay the finder X%, or $X of their first paycheck(s). Does that work? I’d be happy to pay a fellow Redditor if they would do that for me.

I'm looking for some advice on **gearing** and motor interfacing, hopefully with some example parts. Let me walk you through my design so far to make sure it makes sense, and I'll list the parts I've already picked out. My main goal is to meet the torque/speed requirements and stay as inexpensive as possible.

(Warning - this post is a bit involved; it's become my side project / obsession. My background is that of a software engineer learning mechanics with the goal of building robot parts.)

-----------------------------

Here are the key performance requirements: the motor will be attached to a rigid rod of length 0.6m, and at the end of the rod it will need to move/rotate a mass of 6kg at a speed of no less than **0.75sec per 60 degrees**. This is the max torque I will need (at that given speed), and expect to operate on average maybe a third of that torque.

Using tau = r*m*g = 0.6m*6kg*9.81m/s², we see that the required torque is **35.316 Nm**. 

Power: using a speed of 0.75sec per 60 deg, or angular velocity w = 1.396 rad/s, P = tau*w which at that peak operating point described above is **49.31 W**.

For my design I need to keep it as inexpensive as possible, so I found this DC motor: http://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/banebots-rs-550-motor-12v-19300rpm.html 

Key specs: 19300rpm no load speed, 70.55 oz-in (0.498 Nm) stall torque. Using the 70% efficiency and doing a max power calculation at half the stall torque (and w), I see that power this motor could output is 0.7*(0.498/2)*((19300/2)*2*pi/60 = **176 W**, well within my application's desired power. Maybe I could have a stricter speed requirement and require it to rotate faster.

To hit the torque of 35.316 Nm - at the motor's peak power output point - it would seem I need a gearing ratio of 35.316/(0.498/2) ~ 142:1. However, I see that the motor efficiency is 70%, and knowing nothing about the gears to be used, someone online (no citation) said I should assume they have 50% efficiency to be safe. To account for this means to increase the torque output of the motor, by increasing the gear ratio to 142/0.7/0.5 = **406:1**. The resulting angular velocity, at the power max, is 19300rpm/2/406 = 23.768rpm, which equates to 2.489 rad/s or 142.6 degrees / s or **0.421s / 60 degrees**, which is awesome, this meets my application specs with room to spare - assuming my calculations so far are good.

-----------------------------

Now comes the tricky part, moving from the theoretical to selecting actual parts. I've done a lot of looking online for ways to gear a motor 400:1. I'd prefer not to custom-create my own gearbox if others exist, but if it means massive $$$ savings, that's fine. 

I've found a plastic gearbox that seems like it may work: https://www.pololu.com/product/70 
This one would also be fine at the 555:1 ratio: https://www.pololu.com/product/2391  

The ratio is close enough, it looks easy enough to assemble, the cost isn't outrageous. Here are my questions:

1) The gears on the inside are made of plastic. I'm not a mechanical or materials engineer; does anyone know if these plastics can survive the torque/stress/shear/etc that my application would exert on the gears? 

2) Unfortunately these sets come with their own mini-motor which I don't want/need. I need to replace it with the RS-550 above. What is the typical interface between a ""raw"" motor and a gear / gearbox like the above? I have no idea how they would be connected physically. Glue? Twisted on really snug? No idea.

My RS-550 says it has a shaft diameter: 0.12in (3.2mm). These gearboxes come with their own small motor which I don't need. They seem to have a shaft diameter of 2mm according to this data sheet: https://www.pololu.com/file/download/rc_260rasa.pdf?file_id=0J15 meaning that comparatively the RS-550 might be ""too big"" to fit into the gear. What's the right way to make it fit (assuming it somehow could)? 

3) Is there any way to know even a rough upper bound on the torque that a gearbox (of a particular material and dimensions) could handle? 

4) Further part recommendations and component selections are always welcome. While I am price sensitive, I would trade off some cost for a more robust design.

The model I am working on has two springs in series. Spring 1's k constant is very small relative to spring 2 (k1&lt;&lt;k2). The bar the springs are mounted to has a rotation point on one side with a motor to store energy in the system. Spring 1 has a strain limiter so as to act as a solid linkage at a long enough length to allow the motor to store a certain amount of energy in spring 2. 

My question is if the motor is suddenly rotated to a lower energy position does energy dissipate from the higher or lower k value first? I believe that the lower energy springs would dissipate first correct?

Feel free to kill this post if it violates the rules; it's ""school-related"" but more about peoples opinions on the quality of engineers these schools produce. Posted to r/engineeringstudents without much luck.

I'm knocking out my Master's in ME here in the states and am considering pursuing a PhD in Controls. I'd really like to do my graduate studies in Europe, but am having trouble finding information on the quality of the programs there. My school has a good relationship with the university at Bergamo in Italy, which has a 3-year PhD program and looks like lots of fun, but the only example of a dissertation I've seen done there was barely even undergraduate worthy. 

I've looked into Cambridge and UMIST in the UK, but have heard (from my advisor who spent a year there as an exchange student from MIT in the 70's) that these schools tend to be _too_ theoretical and resultingly trap your career in academia. The math+theory is actually a big draw for me, but I'm an engineer first and a mathematician second =p

Does anyone know of a place where I can get a review of the strengths or pros/cons of different PhD Controls/Mechatronics programs? The quality of engineers that tend to come out of the programs, what they focus on/have available, etcetera, would be great. I've seen a lot of this for undergrad degrees in the states and would like a pointer in the right direction.

I apologize in advance as I know this information is out there, but I don't know how to interpret the tables I've found.

**Context**

I currently work for a small steel company. We stack plates of steel outside, separated by 4 x 4's. They are stacked on a flat surface. My employer is considering building pallets with I beams. This would reduce the time it takes us to move the plates (with cold winter temperatures in mind). He has tasked me with finding out how much each one of these pallets might safely hold.

**Pallet Information**

We would use S6 x 17.25 I beams made of A36 steel that are 60 inches in length. 3 beams would be placed 30 inches apart and connected by crosspieces of steel plate (the pallets haven't been constructed yet so I'm not certain of the thickness or layout).

We are only looking to stack the plates 5 high. This would mean the absolute maximum weight on the bottom skid would be 100,000 lbs.

[Here is one of the charts I found while trying to google this problem.](http://sketchup.engineeringtoolbox.com/astm-a6-american-standard-steel-s-i-beams-c_2.html) Unfortunately, I don't know what to do with the moment of inertia / section of modulus, or if those are even what I'm looking for here.

**Questions**

Can three 60 inch long A36 steel S6 x 17.25 I beams safely support 100,000 lbs of weight?

How much weight can they support?

Any explanation as to how you figure this out is greatly appreciated!

I have an air system that essentially looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ICHj8iJ.png), and is currently being fed at 80psi.  Will the PSI at the end point still be 80 or is there loss from the splits?  Or, does the PLC solenoid valve control the PSI?

The issue I'm having is that the pressure regulator on this system will allow me to set a pressure, but once the solenoid valve cuts the air supply off the pressure regulator essentially resets and will not maintain the set point.  I'm starting to wonder if this is a design flaw and the pressure regulator(s) should be feeding the solenoid valve and not the other way around.

Thanks for any help or input!

EDIT - Just for clarification, my issue is with the pressure regulators ""resetting"" to a lower PSI every time the solenoid cycles.  At first I wondered if this was happening because of a pressure drop in the system (because each regulator is running at a different psi, which is an issue).  Thanks to the input from everyone, I think the root issue I'm having isn't caused by loss of pressure but from is cycling the air sent to the pressure regulator.  I can't really go into our exact application, but basically the pressure regulators control the motor speed by increasing or decreasing the psi. The motors are used for 2-3 seconds, down for about 30 seconds, then back up for a few seconds, etc.  

I'll be getting some of the lines swapped around to regulate the pressure going into the solenoid instead of the other way around and see if that fixes my problem. I can fine tune from there with a strobotach to get the speeds where they should be on the motors.

First off, I love this sub. It's so fucking interesting it makes my head spin. So thanks for all that, honestly. Second...what should I learn? Let me clarify. 

I'm a machinist, or I will be again on Monday. I love doing things with my hands. Unfortunately, I also love social sciences...soft science, not like math. I have a BA in psychology and have worked in behavioral psych since 2008 or so, with a couple years off because in 2011-2013 I also worked in machining and destructive testing. 

I looked at my future recently (turns out it's not set) and realized I need to pick one direction and move forward. It was up to a psychiatric nursing MS or get into machining again and really get into metals and material science. So, I decided against heath care....it's honestly tedious and annoying. Easy money, but what comes easily is rarely valuable in the end. 

So here's where I am stuck. I am going to do some welding and some more CAD/CAM stuff so I can get deeper into the design side of things. Then, I am going to start some industrial maintenance learning, because I eventually want to be able to access machines remotely and diagnosis/fix/run them. I've done some networking classes, and it's cool. But....would I be wasting my time by doing this all piecemeal? Machines are increasingly online and therefore part of the internet of things, but what field is that? I could do two semesters, 3-4 classes per semester, in a few fields at the tech school level and translate that into a good living. However, would I be better off just spending two semesters doing math and physics and do a second bachelors in Engineering? I'll need to study my dick off to get good at math again, psych only used SPSS. If I did that, what would I study? General engineering? Computer engineering? Would I take a lot of classes that would be irrelevant to what I want to end up doing? I'm into my mid 30's but I'm single and can pay for school, and I'm eternally curious. To a fault. I want a degree in everything. Lol

For one of my subjects (uni that is), I have to write a technical report on something. (pretty much anything!) 
The Gotthard base Tunnel had piqued my interest recently and so I'm reading further about tunnelling and tunnel boring machines. **You can skip the wall of text and just direct me toward more info explaining the GBT or Gripper TBMs, or if you feel kind enough to explain; I promise, your efforts wont go to waste.**

The following is what I think I understood about the subject so far:


The machines used for GBT were Grippers(they are open shield as the ricks are hard and wont fall or squeeze back?), which were efficient for time and cost, correct or have I overlooked something? 
Is [this](https://www.herrenknecht.com/en/products/core-products/tunnelling-pipelines/gripper-tbm.html) the best available cross section photo and info about them?

According to the two documentaries I've seen about it, [Big Bigger Biggest - Tunnel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8C8ushPtWw) &amp; [The Longest tunnel in the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaTN_R1b00I), the process of work in the GBT is as follows ( please point out what I missed and misunderstood)

Most of the tunnel is being excavated by TBMs (65% according to an outdated[ source from 2008](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alptransit.ch%2Ffileadmin%2Fdateien%2Fmedien%2Fartikel%2FHeinz_Ehrbar-Gotthard_Base_Tunnel__Experiences_with_different_tunnelling_methods_paper_Sao_Paolo_pdf.PDF&amp;ei=KF0qVNWbKsL98AXV-oKIDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNESHEkYkIWY_j88PfB7MdrEJPP3cQ&amp;sig2=l3vUTpRw0bVQ9zyQopZzcg&amp;bvm=bv.76477589,d.dGc&amp;cad=rja)), however the middle section; Sedrun's access shaft section, is being dug using blasting and conventional methods.

*As for how the TBM's are working the following is my understanding:*

* The cutter heads chips away the rocks, rocks fall into the buckets around the cutter heads, they fall down the conveyor belt to be reused^1 ^2?

* just after that we have the machine drilling holes  to install the steal mesh and steal arches^3

* the shotcrete then is sprayed and dries off in few seconds to make sure nothing falls on the workers.

* I saw this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsSlvH92Tl0), but I am assuming the concrete segments are also installed using Gripper TBM and not just the DSU TBMs? so there is the mesh, arches, shotcrete then concrete segments? unless I'm going overboard with assumptions as usual.

* the last thing I remember is there was a section that surveys the upcoming path ahead ( it did not explain how exactly though)

beyond that I do not know much, but would like to. 


^1 Are the mucks used in making the making of shotcrete or the concrete segments? are either of them being made inside the machine at all, as it is over 400m long? One of the docs explained that the mucks go to the factories in the bases to be used in the concrete mix, but wouldn't it have been possible to do so right on the machine or is the journey back and forth from the bases to the machines more efficient and plausible? 

^2 How frequently were the custom made cutterheads replaced in the GBT? and how frequent was that compared to other types of rocks TBMs were used for?


^3 Are the steal meshes and arches stored somewhere on the machine? or are they being supplied daily or something?

Apparently our ""Average Daily Usage"" for normal seasons is ""20kWh"". (And what does that mean anyway - 20kWh x 24hrs = 1 day total? or 20kWh over 24hrs equals 0.83kWh per hour?)

What's that equivalent to, in terms of gravitational potential energy? 

Imagine I have a block of iron weighing many tonnes placed at the top of a tower, and it fell slowly from top to bottom over 24hrs, generating power through gears/cogs attached to a generator. (Don't worry about how the block of iron gets to the top of the tower each day - that's not important. Imagine a Giant lifts it up). 

I'm trying to work out what's the equation to use to generate a ""daily average usage"" of ""20kwh"".

The equations I've found online so far are:

Potential Energy (PE) = m * g * h

E.g.  100000 * 9.8 * 20 = 19600000 Joules = 19.6 megajoules = 5.44... kilowatt hours

But does this mean a 100 tonne block has to fall in 1 hour to generate 5.44 kwH?

I also see the equation: power P in kilowatts (kW) is equal to the energy E in kilojoules (kJ), divided by the time period t in seconds (s).

* Dispense to 2 separate bowls (or be simple enough for 2 parallel units, 1 per bowl)
* Dispense in 5-10g quantities

 * Individual dispensing error is less important than total daily error. (+/- 50% per portion is acceptable)
 * Total daily error (per cat) should be no more than +/- 10%
* Dispensed quantity (either daily total or individual) should be measurable for error correction/fault detection
* Cat-safe

 * No exposed wiring, mechanisms, etc.
 * Accessible/cleanable food contact surfaces
* Cat-proof
 * Violent frontal assault
 * Sneaky paw-up-tube
 * Chewing on protrusions

**Optional requirements**

* Bulk storage (1-2kg)
 * minimal atmospheric ingress to bulk food (to prevent staleness)
* Reliable unattended operation with remote monitoring/fault detection.
 * Fail-safe (overfeed) failure modes

**Constraints**

* Budget of approx 100-150GBP for (dual) dispensing system (i.e. can't really just get an existing industrial unit unless it's going cheap on ebay)
* Parts readily available in UK (no Mcmaster-Carr `:(`)
* Prototype-able with minimal machine-tools (although basic lathe &amp; drill-table might be available, along with hand woodworking tools)
* Simple Is Definitely Better

**Notes**

* Food is primarily 'Royal Canin' granulated kibbles, which are [roughly triangular](http://www.petsunleashed.com.au/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/60x60/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/r/o/royal-canin-indoor-cat-food-4kg-2_1.jpg) and about 10-12mm corner-corner.

* Loose packing volume is approx 100g/cup (dispensing volume is therefore ~1/10 - 1/16th of a cup) Included for visualisation purposes; dosing should be done by mass.

* Food granules have something of a tendency to interlock, and require quite a high shear force when, e.g. scooping into a cup. This can also lead to 'clots' clogging flow if trying to pour through a small enough opening (from experience, not yet quantified)

**Design Ideas**

The simplest ideas I can come up with mostly involve a gravity feed hopper, with some sort of flow interrupter. In the absolute simplest case, this mechanism would be completely duplicated per-bowl so no output redirection is needed.

The problem I forsee with this style is that the hopper opening needs to be quite wide to avoid clogging, which is going to lead to a very high flow rate when the interrupter/gate is opened. Additionally, trying to close the gate may require serious force to overcome the granule shear forces and move aside or crush any jammed granules that would prevent it from fully closing.

Possible gates would probably either be hinged flaps, or some sort of rotary 'hole/no-hole' disk. (subject to above note about problems re-closing) [**Edit**: a linear gate riding in grooved tracks might also work, but I think more prone to jamming than the hinge-flaps?]

Quantity control is something I have no good ideas about; IIRC industrial systems tend to dispense into a container or staging dispenser which can measure its own tared mass. I'd need a staging unit otherwise I'd have to measure weight directly from the feeding bowl itself, which is subject to all kinds of catty interference.

Perhaps something like [this design](https://imgur.com/1D9DFc0) [apologies for terrible diagramming], where [B] is capable of partial rotation around 2 pins which rest on sensors for a strain-gauge or scale.

So the gate at A opens and food trickles into the bucket B until correct amount, then A closes, and B is rotated to dump food down one of the chutes selected by C.
There might be some sort of baffle after the output to prevent reaching up from the output side to the mechanisms.

I'm hoping this can be primarily built (or at least prototyped) from plumbing parts, wood, and steppers or RC servos for the actuators. Sensing (apart from the load cell) would be either microswitch limit detection (or reed-relay/magnet) 

Control will be whatever MCU dev board I have lying around I can find a working programmer/compiler for, or a raspi/arduino if I'm desperate.

I've considered non-gravity fed designs using either a lifting screw or conveyor which would give much better control over the flow rate, but I think the complexity makes them undesirable unless entirely necessary.

**Questions**

* Are there any fatal flaws I haven't considered?
* What's the best option for a gating mechanism?
* Are there better ways to do any of the bits I've suggested?
* Are there any cheap COTS parts to do any of the things I want?

I need to produce graphs of various quantities (thrust, efficiency, etc) against fuel flow rate into the engine.

So to produce a meaningful comparison, my x-axis is the fuel flow rate multiplied by the enthalpy of combustion of the fuel in question. This gives me a value in Watts. 

Now my question is: what should the axis label be? 

I could label the axis as *Heat input (W)*. But, not all of the fuel is burning, so this would be a misleading label.

I've noticed that larger displacement bikes tend to have two discs up front which brings me to the question of why. Unlike a car, braking on a motorcycle tends to be less effective given the need for the rider to balance, steer, and try to stay alive on top of braking, this further gives me more things to think about.

Here are some thoughts or anecdotes I read online on why, but I have thought of equally convincing why-nots as a response to them.

1. A motorcycle tends to have a higher centre of gravity, meaning that weight transfer is more pronounced compared to a car. This means the front:rear brake bias on a motorcycle is more front skewed. 

    **My** **thoughts**: Sure it does, but then squeeze a little too hard and you'll go over your bars. Also, I find it hard to think that weight transfer beats absolute mass. We're talking about two hundred KGs vs a minimum of 1,000KGs for a typical car.


2. More bite. 

    **My** **thoughts**: Even with my single disc I find going over the bars possible, what more with two discs?


3. Better heat distribution between two discs, since they are all so light and cannot retain much heat 

    **My** **thoughts**: The motorcycle discs are a lot more exposed to wind compared to a car's discs. Even if you factor in a potential bow wave (bonus question: does it?) leaving a low-pressure zone where the disc(s) and hub are, there is still a lot more wind than a typical car's wheelwell, which we will use a normal passenger car with no cooling ducts as a model. Do note that many non-sports bikes also do have dual discs up front.


4. It looks damn good, and its just a marketing thing.

    **My** **thoughts**: Try as I may, I really can't disagree with the first bit, as I want one too (See #2). I haven't ridden a dual-disc motorcycle.

I can't think of the dual discs acting as a redundant system since they run off the same hydraulic circuit, with a T-nipple connecting the lines from the lever and both calipers, and the only thing I can think of would be the ease of modulation on dual discs.

Sweeping the net doesn't seem to get me anything because its mainly forum talk.

I'm not too familiar with the Mechanical Engineering specifications for this type of a equipment. 

The reinforced concrete has several ""pedestals"" of varying heights supporting the equipment. Two of the foundations (the shorter ones), give the appearance of lateral shear failures. Delaminations are present in the concrete. No embedded corrosion of the reinforcement. Compressive strength was specified at 4000 psi, Core samples extracted came back at 5000 psi. The structures are less than 10 years old.

That being said, I see failures like this in foundations a lot with vessels and poor slide-plate design. In this particular structure, all anchor bolts and connection details had no slide plate or slotted bolt olds, essentially restricting lateral movement of the compressor. The shortest foundations, thus the ""stiffest"", appear to have picked up the loads, and subsequently failed. I have not done any calculations regarding the lateral capacity of the foundations (not in our scope). 

That being said, my first gut was thermal expansion and contraction, based on experience with vessels foundations. The client indicated to me that the compressor runs 24/7 and varies in temperature from 150ºF to 190ºF and has very low vibrations. My inquiry is in regards to Mechanical Engineering specifications for Compressor foundations/Vibrations. Are slotted bolt connections/slide bearing plates permitted with this type of a equipment? What ASME specification is pertinent?

I am an aerospace engineer with no teaching experience that decided to take on a whole new adventure. I am about to begin teaching an intro to engineering class at a private high school.

The goal is to give the kids an overview of what different engineers do and how an engineer goes about solving problems and collaborating as a team. Each discipline is allotted 3 weeks during the school year and will have a speaker come in to talk to the class and hopefully a fun project to do.

The disciplines are:

+ software

+ electrical

+ petroleum

+ mechanical

+ industrial

+ environmental
+ chemical
+ civil
+ biomedical
+ aerospace

So engineers of reddit, what is your discipline? What is a major/important thing(s) to cover in your field? And do you know of any high school-level projects (maybe even simplified college projects) that will get them excited about engineering? Decent size projects, 1-2 weeks long, can be done in or out of school or both.

Ideas so far:

+ pasta/toothpick/balsawood bridge/cantilever/boom/tower

+ water bottle rocket

+ balsawood rubber band plane
+ raspberry pi/arduino led project

The roof supports will be 4x4's that come down onto our 2x10 beam. The load of the roof is not carried directly to the 6x6's and is thus a point load on the 2x10.

The turbine is rather large and the wind speed averages 1-2 m/s, so it spins pretty slowly if at all. In order for the inverter to activate, it needs a minimum of 50V DC from the rectifier which translates to ~37V AC (3 phase) from the generator. Since my generator doesn't produce this high of voltage regularly, I was given the recommendation to install a x5 delta transformer to boost the voltage. Here is a schematic of the I have been advised to install: https://imgur.com/8PCpGMZ 

My question is essentially this: What's the catch/drawback? There is only a limited amount of mechanical energy from the wind coming into the turbine and electrical system, so what will boosting the voltage do to the system as a whole, as in what am I losing by raising the voltage?

Unfortunately I have just found out the model I have received is too large by a factor of 3. It’s a relatively annoying model to remesh, set up boundary conditions, etc and so I would like to simply adjust the load conditions and the material properties and wanted to run it by here first.

All forces should increase by a factor of 3 (due to units of kg.m.s^-2)  
All pressures should increase by a factor of 1/3 (due to units of kg.m^-1.s^-2)  
Young’s modulus should increase by a factor of 1/3 (due to units of kg.m^-1.s^-2)


Stress which is calculated should then be increased by a factor of 3 to get the ‘real’ stress.

Displacements which are calculated should be increased by a factor of 1/3 to get the ‘real’ displacements

My main worry is that I missing a fundamental point in the way that a FE model runs which will cause to get erroneous responses (an alarm bell is ringing when the difference between the stress and displacements are a factor of 9, and the model calculates by incrementing the load, working out the new displacements, and continuing)

I should be finishing my degree in Astrophysics in the next two years. I plan on continuing my education, but I'm torn between doing a PhD program (in Astronomy, Astrophysics, Cosmology, etc.) or if I should go for my masters in something like Aerospace engineering. 

I made a pros and cons list to try to make my decision. 
Pros for engineering: If I were to choose engineering, the program would be significantly shorter, I would receive a higher income, and I would have more flexibility on my job choice and location in my career.
Cons: There was only one con I could come up with. Engineering may not be exactly what I want to do. But as I haven't really taken any engineering classes, I have no way of knowing that for sure.
Pros for a PhD: It would be something I love and I know I'm interested in.
Cons: I would be in school for several more years. I would make less money. My job opportunities in my field would be more limited, and there is a real chance that I would wind up teaching as a professor(Something I know does not interest me). 

So I guess my question(s) is/are this: What career choices would I have with a BS in Astrophysics and a Masters in Aerospace? What type of work would I be doing? Would it be more mechanics based? (I took physical mechanics this semester which focused on vibrations and waves but it didn't really interest me at all) 

I'm just a little lost right now, and I think having advice from someone in this field would be extremely useful in making my decision.

So I'm a noob welder but an extremely technical kinda guy and I work in failure analysis. My crappy house (built in 85 by a known hack job artist and got it's certificate of occupance in 98 just prior to when i bought it) has 2x12 floor joists 24 inches on center for an 18 foot span. So yea, I've got two floors of lovely indoor trampoline. As luck would have it, I need to replace the sub-floor and was thinking... ""Hey, while I've got that all exposed I should throw in some Pratt trusses for the missing joists""
I was thinking I'd build them myself in two subsections and weld/bolt them together in place that way I don't have to open up an outside wall to slide then in. I will need to leave 1.5 inches for the nailing strip lumber leaving only 9.75 inches of height for my 18 foot truss. My goal would obviously be for these trusses to support at least as much load as the adjacent 2x12's with an at worse equal sag under load.
I'm currently able to make some ugly mig and tig welds. How crazy am I got even thinking this? Also, any idea what size steel I should be using, spacing of the verticals/diagonals etc? My WAG would be to use 3/16 thick web by 2 or 3 inch wide T-bar (or perhaps 2 inch square tube) for the compression members and 3/16 by 2 or 3 flat stock for the tension members. But maybe that's a huge amount of overkill and cost. If I can get away with thinner metal that would be awesome!

Yea this is load bearing shit best left to professionals but as long as what I add more than supports its own weight I think I'd be improving the situation.
