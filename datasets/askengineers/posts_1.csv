I'm a recent grad that has just accepted an offer for an R&amp;D role and I'm set to begin in two weeks time. I've asked the team manager for a 1-on-1 meeting next week, where I wanted to talk about my role and responsibilities.

I wanted to tell the manager who I am as a person and what I want to get out of this role. I want him to know that I'm driven and ambitious and would like responsibilities outside of my role in the future. I also want to relay how it's important for me to keep learning and would like him to give me outlets to learn new skills.

I went to the standard and I'm totally flabbergasted by the terminology.  Every time i think T2 or T3 makes sense, i go to a different part of the explanation and it conflicts.  Specifically

 - which temperatures (T1, T2, T3) am i going to be able to find on a spec sheet and which do i have to calculate?
 - For regular thick film resistors, do i use the line for ""various""? or is thick film resistor one of the categories above.
 -  Note 3 confuses the hell out of me.  Which derating factor do you use there?  it seems recursive since you use T2 to find the derating factor at your temperature.  
 - note four is also confusing.  wouldn't the supplier provide T2 and not T3?


example i'm trying to calculate has spec sheet that says ""temperature range @derated power (C)= 70-155"".  Max operating temp 155.  

 - T1=70C
 - Tx=155C.  I can't tell if 155 is corresponding to T2 or T3.  My first thought was it was T2 but i don't think the math works out.  You have to re-arrange the equation to solve for T3 and then i get a value of 240C (thats a high value but the part looks like it can handle 260C durring reflow.  
 - If the 155 corresponds to T3, then T2 is 112.5 which seems like a much more reasonable value in terms of doing derating and that ends up matching one of the example spreadsheets i'm looking at.

I have just started a new job (2 months), I accepted this offer despite the fact that I have no interest in this field because it was quite a dark time for me, I had just quit benzodiazepines and was a mess and afraid nobody would take me, so I settled for something I would have never accepted otherwise.

However, after talking to my manager about the crazy rent prices I've been offered quite a big bonus (slightly more than a month of work), note that I didn't even directly ask for it, I was just explaining why I was still in a residence outside of the city.

However, that is not enough to change the situation, and I would like to avoid taking the bonus if I'm leaving soon, but not accepting the bonus would mean alerting my manager that I want to leave or at least that something is wrong. I obviously would like to already have something else before leaving, so this would be pretty bad.

The only other option is asking to have a change in client (I'm working for a consultancy firm) or in type of job, but that hardly seems possible as the only reason why they have been so accommodating is because I'm the first consultant they managed to place at a big client and they don't want to lose that client. And again explaining why I'm not happy here could potentially alert him to the fact I want to leave without any benefit for me.

Can you think of any way to not accept this bonus without it being a major red flag?

Or should I just take it and then leave them anyway? I'd feel like a total scumbag and those would be burned bridges for sure

I remember briefly learning about this type of engineering/design, which I only remember in this abstract way, so please forgive my poor explanation, but I would appreciate it if anyone knew the term for what I'm talking about. This is not a riddle or a troll

It usually involves plastics. The flexibility and strength properties of the material must be measured and simulated. Instead of using standard mechanical techniques like perfectly fitted parts, gears, levers, and square forces, the atypical bendiness is exploited to achieve cheap or better alternatives. I guess the twist is almost treated like a spring. Two very basic examples would be a zip-tie, and a ""plastic door latch"". Maybe even a ""snap/popper button"". I guess there is something phallic (specifically thinking of the tip) about all the examples I can think of.

I remember that there were many cooler examples of how to exploit this property of plastic (which were not all phallic btw) so this exploitation was designated its own niche subfield of design/engineering. Plastics just happen to be the best materials for this, but sometimes other materials would work.

The essence of it, is that is exploits the known torsion capacity of materials, or exploits their flexibility, instead of looking at parts as rigid, static, perfectly fitted together things.

Would greatly appreciate any help, as I won't be able to remember this on my own, and I've exhausted my google search term creativity.",True,False,False,AskEngineers,t5_2sebk,284608,public,self,What's this type of engineering called?

One solution is the star wars route - a shaft of plasma held in shape by...something. Could a magnetic field actually be projected in that shape?

I was thinking something based on [electric armor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_armour) \- a weapon that deposits an enormous current into whatever it strikes. Does that make sense, or would the weapon be destroyed as well? Could armor just be made out materials resistant (or conductive) to electricity to counter that?

I’m working on a project and trying to size a pump to supply flow to a nozzle. I’m looking at getting 200gpm at a pressure between 165-215psi. I know this is a simple project but i’m really struggling with understanding what i’m doing. 

I modeled my system curve by using the equivalent length method, summing all of the fittings and straight pipe to get a straight length of pipe then i used a head loss number for “ftH2O loss per 100ft” to get a total head loss through the system due to the pipe and fittings.  I then added the static head and the velocity head to get the total head loss for the entire system. This causes my system curve to be well under the pump curve and they do not intersect (or if they do it’s way beyond the operating point i’m looking to achieve)

The system starts at a tank which a pump pulls from (low pressure high flow) and sends it up 3 floors through 4in pipe then reduces down to 3in pipe for about 200 feet, with an elevation drop and then goes into another pump (known as the booster pump, high pressure low flow). The booster pump is what we are striving to replace. We need more pressure and flow to the nozzle it is powering. After the booster pump there’s about 80ft of 4in pipe that reduces to 2in pipe and a rubber hose, and an elevation change of roughly 25 feet. It then feeds into the nozzle. 

I apologize for the terrible description, it’s a complex system to describe. Anyways, I re-did the system curve using 1.5inch pipe after the booster pump which goes all the way to the nozzle and it intersected the pump curved a lot closer to where i want it to. But 200 gpm at 185 PSI seems unreasonable (way too high?) to push through a 1.5 inch pipe. Which is where i’m confused. 

Do these flow and pressure numbers make sense to push through a 1.5 inch pipe? I’ve also considered adding a throttling vale into the 4inch line to steepen the system curve and make it intersect where i want it to, but that doesn’t seem like it would be feasible because it’s pretty far off from where i want it to be. 

Is it reasonable to ignore the first pump and any piping in between the pumps if i know the suction pressure at the inlet to pump 2? Should i model the system curved after pump 2 and use the suction pressure to find a pump head pressure and then see where they intersect for flow using the variable piping (1.5in which is a theoretical replacement and 4in which is already in place). Money is tight so if i don’t have to replace the 4 inch pipe then i would be much better off but it doesn’t seem like that’s going to happen because it’s not restrictive enough to allow the system curve to intersect where i need them too. 

I apologize if this is a confusing question i’m just very new to pump sizing and this is the first one i’ve done and it’s a little confusing to understand how the system will physically behave by modeling it on a graph.
