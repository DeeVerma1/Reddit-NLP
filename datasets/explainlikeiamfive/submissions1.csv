What I imagine is a flow of water, in electricity these are electrons. Resistance is the amount of electrons NOT flowing through, but somehow this is measured in Ohms. Then there is Voltage and Amperage which I do not understand. However main confusion is why resistance is measured in Ohms and not volts. If I measure a plank, height and with are same units, although they describe different things.   
I can not even understand this picture, because it shows voltage and amperage is the same thing, so I see no difference:

So, if a fully functional adult willingly refuses to take necessary and incredibly simple steps to prevent wasting public resources and insist that modern medicine is all lies - then is it not unethical to treat that person? They didn't consent to medical treatment, so why are we admitting them to hospitals full of doctors and evil scientistst?

I cannot force an atheist to pray to jesus, and if an atheist has a problem they are not going to go to a church to try and solve it. I won't even suggest they go to a church. That's the same logic right?

So why are cancer patients being turned away in favour of people who wanted to get sick in the first place?

What are the ethics of having unvaccinated medical staff not disclosing their status? Do patients not have the right to be safe from communicable illness? When I was a nursing student many eons ago, I had to get various immunizations before I was allowed to do my practicum. 

I got Hep B &amp; Chickenpox vaccines, and had to have up to date MMR, BCG, DPT. I also have up to date boosters for the mumps (as there was an outbreak in 2007 in a first-world country) and viral meningitis.

When I wanted to immigrate from one first-world country to another, I had to produce all my immunizations from birth, chest x-rays, blood tests, physical fitness tests - and all of these had to be done by an approved doctor, and not my own country's doctors (Even though my country is like the top destination for medical tourism...)

&amp;#x200B;

These are all really important requirements, and I had no problem fulfilling them.

The nazis wanted to make such device. They called it sun gun .The sun gun has mirrors that can concentrate sunlight at a particular location and so that can heat that area. They said they would need a 9 km diameter mirror to achieve this. Wanted to use sodium metal. But a constellation of geosynchronous mirror satellites can also do this work. The heat can be used for producing electricity. And as the solar concentrator is in space it can be scaled and made bigger and more electricity can be generated. I think it can solve the energy crisis. So why no one is thinking in this direction. People and countries all over the world are pooling resources to make a fusion reactor but they always say that they are 30 years away from achieving it. But space based solar concentrator can be created in this generation. We already made the international space station. We regularly send satellites to space.

Dividing into subcategories you measure intelligence down to some useful parameter of existence which is perceived and analyzed. With, say, mathematics, the better able you are able to perceive and act on systems of symbolic formal logic with soundness and swiftness, the smarter you are, because that is a ""velocity with which you can perceive and and act on sound patterns in existence."" It is just that the perimeters of existence in question are those which are limited to a very formalized language of limited inherent descriptive power"". Whenever I have taken a test either related to IQ or not, it is often a timed test and it is testing for your ability to perceive information through questions, either on the test merely or also through memory recall, and answer in a sound manor, relative to the explicit or implicit true premises behind those questions.

&amp;#x200B;

This should lead to the ability to quantify the rate at which you can answer similar questions around a similar discipline correctly, and, therefore, a velocity at which you can dispense correct knowledge about something. My question is: why don't we talk about intelligence in terms of units of velocity and/or correctness of your actions, and not in terms of a tool of comparison that is very vague in how it communicates information?

&amp;#x200B;

Like, think about if we did this for, say, bicep curls. If the median person can curl 97 lbs. with their biceps, we don't say that someone who can curl 194 lbs. has a Bicep Curling Quotient of 200. But we do this with IQ, right? We take tests which measure how quickly you can answer questions, and how correctly, and we churn out a competitive number which tells the general population nothing useful because we don't know the nature of the velocity and soundness of the median persons actions and how it compares with the velocity and soundness of the velocity of people to the left or right of the bell curve, and where you can understand at what levels someone is likely to be mentally deficient, or average, or a genius.

&amp;#x200B;

It also fails to communicate whether we are actually getting smarter or dumber and by how much, and how we can better appreciate or know that something is wrong with where we are headed. Like, if, say, in the future, we genetically engineered ourselves to all have a minimum of velocity and soundness of action that would result in a 180 IQ today, then someone with an IQ of 75 in that era would have an IQ of around 200 in ours. They would probably be indistinguishable from their colleagues in common company. But someone with an IQ of 75 probably has a very distinguishable lack of general intelligence in common company, just as someone who could barely curl 40 lbs. would have a distinguinshably small frame or broken or atrophied muscles compared to their common company. But why? What makes it so that the rate and correctness at which you can answer questions on an IQ test would result in a such a dimmer person between those in the 75 point range, compared to the 100 point range? And what makes people in the 150 point range such a more talented person when it comes to seeing and making sense of the world? What is the real underlying gap here that communicates how stark does a difference has to be in order to result in the sorts of IQ scores that are extreme enough to predict noticeable stupidity or retardation, just typical intelligence, and profound giftedness?",True,False,,False,Explainlikeiamfive,t5_3fejr,1526.0,public,self,,,ELI5: Why do we measure intelligence primarily as a comparison to the average on a distribution?,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Explainlikeiamfive/comments/grgcf5/eli5_why_do_we_measure_intelligence_primarily_as/,,False,,[],1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My best solution (to 2 decimal places) is `F= [3.65, 7.24, 4.35 ]`  
But that feels wrong, like the distance `AF` would no longer be `5m`

When I try and imagine applying two sets of pythagoras, treating the angles as 2D slices I imagine the line being changed by the second operation...

It may feel kind of perculiar to me, that people would find this lifestyle and intense feelings towards someone, but that doesn't change the fact that I geniuenly want to understand them.  


So, either if you are one who have an anime girlfriend (or boyfriend for that matter) yourself, or have some knowledge about it, could you be so kind of explaining in some greater details.  


1. Like, do you/they believe, that theese characters actually excist? Or are the internal roleplaying just giving you great joy and comfort?  

2. Have they take the ""spot"", so speak? Are they/you going to replace them with a real life partner if they/you meet a romantic offer, or are they/you going to stay true to them? Or would they/you say they/you could have both, if they agreed to the terms?  

3. Do they/you feel a deep connection to this said character? Or is it attraction based purely?  

4. Is it because you/they feel like they/you can't have a woman (or man) for yourself out in the real life?

Have I made a complete fool of myself?

I sent this follow up email one week after the phone conversation in early December where he asked me to send over my resume.

Hello,


I sent a speculative enquiry (below)last week regarding an unpaid position. 


I wonder if you had a chance to look over my details. 


Please do advise me of your decision. 


Thanks


Hi Sophia. Unfortunately we do not have any suitable openings at the current time. I will definitely keep your cv under reference for suitable junior roles in the near future.

Best, Steve

In mid-Feb I re-contacted him with this

Hi Steve. I’m wondering, any Unpaid Junior roles? Anything I can do to better my chances?

Sophia 

Response 

We really don’t have any positions at the moment Sophia, although I definitely admire your energy. If anything suitable comes along I will certainly be in touch.

Best,Steve

I really hope so and look forward to it. Because I have research that I would like to show you then. 

Best wishes Steve 

Sophia 



Is this all just a very polite, time wasting rejection? I have had rejections many, many times in the past but they are usually direct and to the point.eg you need more experience, try again in a few years, we look for xyz qualifications.

I also included a sample of my work in the initial email. I know that my work is 'competent' for a newbie, as the institute I trained with actually offered me job which I rejected as I did not feel I would progress in a learning environment as I would in a real work situation.
